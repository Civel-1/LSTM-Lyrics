[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga [inaudible] slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]

[Intro: 2Pac]
19-motherfuckin'

[Verse: J. Cole]
1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop

[Outro: Xzibit, C.L. Smooth  & JAY-Z]
Listen to my niggas so-so you can wake up
The-the way I play the rap game, call it prophecy
Or understand the intelligence that Jay has

1983, she arrived
35 years later, I'm grateful I survived
I almost didn’t make it past 9
Jokes on you, yea I’m still alive
Tryna find the right path but I’m so young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 17
Money, women, parties, the homies on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Why y’all actin' woke, but still broke? umm
I respect the struggle but you all fronton' these days
Man, they not even 20 talking bout drive by’s
To tell them what they should do, who am I?
I quit my job to get my priorities straight
You see there’s more to life than getting paid , or getting laid, i’m just sayin’
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
Appreciate your family they could be gone in one day
Despite it i’m not looking back, that’s the wrong way
I got some good advice, stay on patrol
Be gone satan, you part of the wrong gang
I’m on God’s team, till I no longer age
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the hot new sound
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see the minority’s get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These kids love that you don't give a really care '
Cause that's exactly what's expected when you always swear
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, man, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be trap and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in liquor, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you,  True, you think you got better things to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'

1985, ben doğdum
33 yıl, vay be, hayatta olduğum için minnetarım
25'imizi geçmememiz gerekiyordu
Şakalar sana amcık, hala hayattayım
Yeni çıkan zencilerin hepsi genç
Herkes onların yaptığı müziğin aptalca olduğunu söylüyor
18 yaşımı hatırlıyorum da
Para, parti, amcık, ben de aynı şeylerin peşindeydim
Çocuklara büyümeleri için şans tanımalısın
Bugünlerde herkes bir şeyler biliyormuş gibi konuşuyor
Zenciler ayık gibi davranıyorlar ancak onlar parasızlar
Çabanızı takdir ediyorum ancak bu günlere sizler öncülük ediyorsunuz
Adamım, daha araba sürecek yaşta bile değiller
Onlara ne yapacaklarını söylemek mi? Ben kimim?
Onlardan birinin beni disslediğini duydum, şaşırdım
Yaklaş küçük adam, seninle konuşmama izin ver
Bakalım senin için büyük resmi çizebilecek miyim
Tebrikler, annenin evinden ayrılabildin
Umarım annene bir ev alabilecek kadar kazanırsın
Bakıyorum saatin parıltılı ve araban pahalı
Bir tavsiyem var, tur yapmayı asla bırakma
Çünkü bu günlerde biz rapçiler böyle kazanıyoruz
Garip lil rap isimlerinle dalga geçiyorum
Müziğini duyuyorum ve rap'in değiştiğini biliyorum
Bazıları bunun kötü bir şey olduğunu söyleyebilir
Çünkü artık her şey reklama dayalı ve pop
Trap drumlar havalı olan şeyler artık
Görüyorsun, yeni nesil için bir görevdeyim
Neyse boşver, bu sadece bir geçiş
Söylemem gerekli ki parçalarından etkilenmedim, hey
Ancak siyahi birinin para kazanması hoşuma gidiyor
Ayrıca bu işten zevk alıyorsun ve buna saygı duyuyorum
Ancak yarattığın etki üzerinde hiç düşündün mü?
Bu beyaz çocuklar senin hiç bir şeyi umursamamanı seviyorlar
Çünkü tenin siyah olduğunda senden bunu bekliyorlar
Senin dab atmanı bekliyorlar, senin hap atmanı bekliyorlar
Suratından topuklarına kadar dövme içinde olmanı bekliyorlar
Ve derinlerde bir yerlerde, siktir, gerçekçi olmam lazım
Onlar siyahi olmak istiyorlar ve parçalarının öyle hissettirdiğini düşünüyorlar
Yani sen bir şey yaptığında onların da yaptığını görebilirsin
Sonraki şehire geç, zamanı geldiğinde paranı topla
Paranı alıp, sürtükler içinde yüzüyorsun, seni suçlamıyorum
Ancak benim ve senin gibi gözükmeye çalışan insanları düşünmüyorsun
Doğru, yapman gereken daha önemli şeyler var
Kazandığın paralarla bir varoşu satın alabilirsin
Biliyorum bu gelir hiç bitmeyecekmiş gibi hissediyorsun
Ancak sana bunun doğru olmadığını söylemeliyim
Bir gün seni dinleyen çocuklar büyüyecek
Ve senin patlamana sebep olan şey için çok yaşlı olacaklar
Artık onlar gelmediği için şovların zayıf gözükecek
Ve bu ne yazık ki paranın azalması demek
Şimdi tekrar göz önüne gelmek için umuyor ve kıvranıyorsun
Ancak trendleri takip ettiğin için patladığını unutuyorsun
Şimdi sen eskidin ve pişmanlıklar içinden geçiyorsun
Çünkü o evi satın almadın, yerine Benz aldın
Onlarca mücevher ve ayakkabı aldın
Onlarca sahte arkadaş edindin, seni yargılamıyorum
Sadece rap yaptığın konu hakkında rap yapmaya  devam edersen neler olacağını söylüyorum
Dibe gitmek için iyi bir rota
Sana iyi şanslar diliyorum
İyiliğin için göründüğün kadar aptal olmadığını umuyorum
Ancak insanların söyledikleri gerçekse
Gerçekten benim adımla dalga geçiyorsan
O zaman gerçekten boku yediğini bilirim, güven bana
Sonsuza kadar çevrende olurum çünkü yeteneklerim yeri boylamak isteyen tüm zenciler için kusursuz
İşler boka sardığında dediklerimi hatırla
Beş yıl içinde Love&Hiphop'a çıkacaksın zenci



[Intro: Buddy]
Ayy
These motherfuckers, man, yo

Drunken partying, slobbering, 'nother sloppy night
Always fight with my mama, but look, on my leave night
I'll call her, when I'm a baller, I promise that I'ma score you
Until then, I'ma ignore you, it's nothing personal (Sorry)
I'm just tryna fuck a couple girls and go
Can't do that while I'm on the phone
I'm not a mother's boy, I'm a motherfucker

[Interlude: Buddy]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, hold on, hold on, nigga
Can I smoke? Can I smoke? Can I smoke, nigga?
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Smino]
Roll up and pour me a drink up, let's get fucked up

Roll up and pour me a drink up, let's get fucked up
Roll up

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
Yeah
Sittin' sideways, side steppin' side bitches
Side eyes, light skin, need stitches, mind your business

My girl drippin', dirty whispers in my ear

ABC your way up out the convo
Lookin' for sluts, oh?
Oh, I know a couple

[Interlude: Buddy]

[Chorus: Smino]
Roll up and pour me a drink up, let's get fucked up (Bro, bro)
Roll up and pour me a drink up, let's get fucked up
Roll up and pour me a drink up, let's get fucked up
Roll up

[Verse 4: JID]
Look, okay the weed so strong it got me stressed
The stress so strong it got me weak
I'm so on, it threw me off (Yeah)
I'm throwed off, yes indeed
I threw up after my threesome
On my threads, had to leave the crime scene like criminals do
She wanna come to my crib and give me a genital smooch
Typical, typical, get the piccolo, skididdle, skedaddle
I sling peen like a lasso
That mean king save the queen from the castle
I grab the saddle
Prisoner to prescription, it's changed, jackal, Jack Daniels
Shawty tryna tell me

[Interlude: Buddy]
Motherfucker, ayy, didn't I say? Nigga, ayy
We can't rap, nigga, we smoking weed
Stop rappin', nigga, this is not a rap session
We gettin' high

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
If I smoke a blunt right now
I'ma be on 285 with my pants pulled down
Around my ankles
Still no stranger to the blunt smoke, gun smoke
You niggas don't want smoke
No guts like that Swisher we just smoked
We cutthroat, niggas...

[Outro: Buddy]
Hold, hold on, hold on
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, ayy, wait
Shh, shh, shh
Wait, wait, wait, okay
Watson, Watson, stop
'Cause this nigga J. Cole, he done grew some dreads
He think he smoke now
Pass the blunt, nigga, stop rappin'
That's the end of the song, nigga
This the end of the session, we goin' home
I just called my Lyft
I just wanna call the, I mean hit the blunt, I mean
Let me try one more time



[Verse 1]
1994 arrived
My life is summoned because my father found his beloved with whom to spread eternal love
And, spread the fruit of his loins
From the 3-point line, he shot a shot with such accuracy I had to join – I had no choice
The needle dropped, I preferred to play a song so quietly
But, my family name proposed the opposite ironically
If I didn’t adapt, I’d be crucified by society
I became a witness to the musical talent that laid within
A living testament, or maybe a walking weapon with a demeanor that likes to lyrically murder on a whim
I’m not joking
Fucking provoke me and you can meet the ocean
No floating
I wish your family well
You just disgraced your entire family lineage
They pray you living in Hell
Living on the sidelines has taught me all the guidelines of living in power, money, and prestige
Without the repercussions of not having a Plan B
Plan B requires prior knowledge of the situation only derived from experience and meditation
That’s why it’s laughable when young niggas repeat the cycle of being young and dumb with money
You look like an eye soar
Your ineptitude makes you twice as irrelevant
Yet, this type intellectual deficiency is prevalent and so pervasive amongst the masses
Like now it’s cool to put your brain in the casket

[Verse 2]
I belong to a generation that’s ostentatious
No need for debate, I’m well aware we all used to be that way
It’s quite contagious
You say it’s a phase that everybody outgrows
So if I complain, I’m just hatin’
To me, it sounds like you compensating for lack of skill sets
Your compensation shows – it don’t match to the real vets and the pioneers
The individuals responsible for your career
They possess the talent to eradicate you down to the molecular structure
Do not muster up the bravery to fight ‘em
You must’ve been utterly mistaken with mediocre
The minute you thought you had a chance, the jig is up, you losing focus
They see an opening, provoke your life source until it’s depleted
You even pleaded guilty to falsifying your credibility
You stand defeated
Not only do you get paid for being stupid, you get it for decreasing the value of what it means to rap
What it means to pack ammunition and then pull and release the Mac trigger
You stacking up in your bank account, now you thinking you bigger
What the fuck you gon’ do when niggas ain’t fuckin’ with ya?
You scramble for every bit of change and every bit of fame to stay relevant
They remember your song, but not your name
If this applies to you, this is either a diss or you can change
I recommend you change, because my sentiment will be disdain if you cause beef
I’ll only see it as leisure while you steady competing tryna scramble for words to defeat me
This is not up for discussion, my lyricism is lethal
Lethal injection if you choose to play the record – I’m evil, nigga!

[Outro]
Let it be known then
Really, though
Niggas thought this was a fucking joke
This ain’t no hobby, cuhz
Bring your A game



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed
Never met death, well, at least not yet
Off to the place where they rest under flowers
Niggas get wetter, like sex in the shower
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?
I know the world is going to come to an ending
Before it does can finish up my sinning?
I see the devil grinning, as if he was winning
This is the bottom of the ninth inning
I'm coming back like light skinned
What a sad sight, looking at my gas light
Like "Damn man, I just threw 10 in"
Look five dollars won't get you what it use too
And look, love don't mean what it use too
And everybody and their mommas on youtube
Is it just me, or is this unusual?
Don't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll
So let me slow down, to the beat ya'll
Put the remote down, move your feet dawg
One time for the niggas holding heat ya'll
Keep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt
See me, I rather cut catch her body give birth
If you were the last nigga walking on earth
Turn yourself and clap your hands like this was church

[Hook: J. Cole]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I say money make the girls go down
They say money make the world go 'round
So my broke niggas, ain't it a shame
If Bill Gates made it rain
Then world goin' drown
Can I get a dollar?
Shawty got a low Impala
Made that ass drop, hydrola', holla!
Know she got a man, and I don't understand
Why he don't grab that bitch by the collar
Follow, look uh
I need my women a little hood
Living in a world where bad means good
That explains why the bad hoes attract 'em
That explains why the bad rappers go platinum
Or gold these days, go DJ
If the world stops spinning like a old DJ
Keep playing, I need a little more time
Pre paying, just a few more dimes
We slaying, keep praying, hoping
2012? You gotta be joking!
Ain't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign
But +The Whole World+ done lost they minds
Look, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville
This is not a test, this is not a drill
This is all real so before we all kill
Let me get one more feel. Baby!

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Lil Cole]
Yeah, hey
Duck motherfuckers, run for your lives motherfucker
It's Lil Cole nigga. hahaha
The world is coming to an end nigga (It's coming to an end motherfucker, haha)
It's coming to an end trust me
I see it all revelation motherfuckers, all that shit
It's Lil Cole, you know I'm going in straight in to heaven nigga, holla at me

[Bridge x2]
Earthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes
You meaner than Katrina baby I gotta know your name
Before this thing is over this might be the last song
For the man upstairs put the lights on and shut this party down

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, G.O.O.D

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping "Ready or Not"
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Seems life's never at a standstill, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex-girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't schools teach more mathematics?
Less trigonometry and more about taxes?
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life instead of lab rat us?
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we could catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speedboat my dad always wanted
Mm, I swear I feel it coming

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, J. Cole]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world



[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls

If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
(Yeah, yeah)
Grey wiley black stitching
On a train, same slang, plain Jane, the style is crispy
24 karats gazelles clear, yeah
I'm so fly real year
Price so la, feel weary
Besides killin gear
It's sniffin', plain white lines
But jumpin' off phenomenal missions
Yep drugs sellers that was in '88
Learned how to true
To shoot through, my cool escape
My Uncle huskie karate nigga die, who stayed in jail
He did a twenty piece
He came home, block movers still know who he is
To us we was kids he said, "Get rich and love life"
Don't fuck with no pigs yo, those days are hazed
Now we in chronic mode, no more plays
Runnin' up a rob a clothes, home or what
All we had was us and its sucks
The fly niggas is broke
Smoke coke, weed, and dust
I changed for the better, brand new Beretta
Slappin' a nigga face at the steal give me your leather
Through it all I learned a lot
Plus I burned a lot
The chronic now returned the clock

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, & Raekwon]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold (Yeah yo)
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Outro: Big Sean & Raekwon]
It wouldn't hurt so bad, I want you to know
It's the one and only dude, singing in tone, you dig?
And this is so many keys, the mixtape
Brought to you by my family
You already know what it is
Finally Famous over everything
My bro Key Wayne, my bro DJ Mo Beats, let's get it
Let's go, uh



[Produced By Syience]

[Intro]
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And I'm all up in that spot
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Throwin' blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like

[Outro]
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey



[Verse]
Yeah, grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega Man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, a real black queen
If I had a genie, I'd wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house this shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know this shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying "Get off me!"
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only twelve
I wish I wouldla bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared a nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self-defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, ayo genie last wish, free my nigga



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only

[Intro]
Yeah
I remember I would just go on YouTube and listen to the loop of this for hours on end

[Verse]
Can't be bothered to think of opening lines
Hard to think straight when you know it's your time
And your attention's fixed on how your life's showing the signs
And you just wanna get your thoughts out, you're not focused on rhymes
Got school in the morning, I'm supposed to be sleeping
I'm too motivated to and my anxiety's tweaking
Way too many thoughts at once, got me feeling surrounded
Usually, I'd get doubtful, but I know that's dumb-sounding
How could I doubt myself when these people believe in me?
I'm getting to know the good person that they see in me
Other kids in the class wouldn't leave him be
Or just talk to him and then at him in secrecy
Got to know himself a little and he ran with it
Realized it was okay to be so damn timid
Put it all in song, now he's finna advance with it
Even if the ones around him don't follow his plans with him
Trying to find myself cost me a boyfriend, that's tough
Saw the bad that I was causing, things were running amuck
I'm out the equation, and now he's happier than he was
That's what I wanted, hope he doesn't think I left just because
Now I'm trying to figure things out for myself
How to kill off the self-blame and doubt that I felt
Found my wings, I'm just learning how to fly, so let me spread them
They gon' say I'm taking too much room, talk? Imma let em
Thinking back to when Cudi stopped me from doing something stupid
I almost jumped, thank God I wasn't bold enough to do it
Him, T, and Bino made me feel less alone
Like I'm not the only weird black kid they've ever known
Felt validated and represented for once
Happy even though I would still sit alone at lunch
I was listening to Good Kid, m.A.A.d city on the bus
Black Boy Fly on repeat when I felt like giving up
The music was there when I thought no one cared for me
Now I wanna be here for you like it was there for me
First I gotta kill these thoughts of what I'm scared to see
So I can be the person I prepare to be
Losing track of the bars, documenting this moment
Now it's 10:40 PM, losing time to my focus
Got a DM from Hospey, that just made me remember
We gotta talk about our plans to take over November

[Outro]
You'll find out what I mean later (laughs)
This shit sounds beautiful
Yeah
And we out



[Verse]
Livin' life but it feels like the end of it
It's a cold world when you don't got a friend in it
Hell, what am I to do?
What if I don't give a damn what I am to you?
I do this shit for me, it's like therapy
That's why I keep the pen around
'Cause you were never there for me but it is
And you don't like the fact that I did this
But it's whatever, I could stay forever on your shit list
This time, I'll do it for me
I don't care about the money, I would do this shit for free
If it ain't about the words then it's all about the beat
Lose yourself in the music, put it on repeat
Tryna put your ass to sleep but the music got you thinkin'
Thinkin' 'bout your problems and that shit got you drinkin'
Drinkin' 'til you solve 'em or drinkin' 'til you're numb
You could figure it out, but now drinkin' got you dumb
And you wonder what happened, everything used to be fine
Everything I want now used to be mine
And it slipped away, wishin' you could rewind
Lookin' at your girlfriend, wishin' you could read minds
Lookin' at your watch, wishin' you could freeze time
Lookin' at your problems, tryna throw the peace sign
Deuces, and get the hell up outta there
But you got no cash flow, you don't even got a prayer
Dang, it's weighin' on you heavy
You weren't even ready and it hit you like a ton of bricks
Everything was cool, how the hell'd it go from fun to this?

[Outro]
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way
Get the hell outta your bed and get a better day



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It ain’t hard to tell, I excel and prevail
Young niggas raising hell but talk well
Make sales, and managed to evade jail
Blessed on the road to success, wasn't paid well
But here we are, breathing, fuck demons
Never get caught sleeping, I’d rather be caught dreaming
Now me and my niggas be flying across seas
Laughing at the days we used to rack tall T’s
Now we rock shows up in London, wondering
How they even heard of me
Never did occur to me if I get to the top one day
Lotta niggas gonna be sending shots some way
Could it be the words that I jot then say
Across the bed, hoes you never got complain
One day, though, some day is on
One day you’re here, next day you’re gone

[Verse 2: Alexis Jordan]
Wake up with the fear of living for another day
Tell myself that it’s nothing that I can’t take
Your strength is the sickness I can’t hide
I try to be invisible to him
Make no noise, tip toe through everything
Hell’s fury feeds the fear inside

[Chorus: Alexis Jordan]
It’s like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
It’s a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover

[Verse 3: Alexis Jordan]
I made choices that I cannot live with
I regret not choosing over him
I’m suffocating in this life
Don’t know if I can survive this weather
And you turn up with your arms and umbrella
I send a farewell tonight

[Chorus: Alexis Jordan]
It’s like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
It’s a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
My life could be a movie, dawg; let me write the script
It would be something truly never read like a crypt
Little nigga with clothes full of hoes like a pimp
Far from a flower but I rose like a blimp
Now who we gonna cast for the roles in this flick?
Only bad hoes getting chose for the tricks
Who gonna play the lead, though? Will Smith? Maybe
Second thought, fuck it, can't nobody ever play me

[Bridge 1: J.Cole]
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
One day you’re here, next day you’re gone

[Bridge 2: Alexis Jordan]
I know the risk has come, I know I can run into your arms
I know you’ll come to save me from harm

[Chorus: Alexis Jordan]
It’s like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
It’s a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover



[Verse 1: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

[Refrain: Logic]
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
Like the white woman said oh my (Oh my)
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my

[Bridge: Logic]
Sometimes I can’t get you out of my mind
Baby, no I just can’t find, I just can’t find
Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind
Sometimes everyday right on time
But right now in my mind
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time

[Verse 5: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a...
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me

Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
My oh my, oh my
Feeling innocent, oh my
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky, to the sky
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance



[Intro]
Okay, I lied
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood—true lie
See, I would, but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo' bitch, give yo' niggas dap
The hood gon' ballistic
Cole was here and you missed it
That nigga walk like Obama man
Shook yo momma hand and then kissed it
This pimp shit, this pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard, no wimp shit
Put in that work, no temp shit
Ya bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rapping shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggas move 'caine like Kappa shit
Can't map this shit
From no bed springs in my mattresses
To fuckin' these bad little actresses
I'm bad as shit, ha

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Chorus]
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit, bitch

[Bridge]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce

[Verse 2]
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight, put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
So if you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the newer shit, rockin' jewel shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable?
Keep niggas on they toes, no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Chorus]

[Outro]
My nigga Syience killed this motherfucking beat



[Verse]
Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes—but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathia's
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD—album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late MC whose name was The Notorious—
Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back
Next up to bat is my nigga, Bas
After that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's that New York City kid plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Damn, damn, damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my ol' girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at old girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one, hut two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next, on, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 2: Miguel]
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause her eyes, n' those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3: Miguel]
'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause her eyes, n' those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you, mmh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
All I want is you, ooh-ooh, ooh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone

[Post-Chorus: Miguel & J. Cole]
'Cause they don’t smile or smell like you
And they don’t make me laugh or even cook like you
And they don’t photograph, nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it (yeah), I can’t replace it (yeah)
That's why all I want is you now

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, "I’m wrong", you say, "Come again?"
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang

[Chorus: Miguel]
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone

[Outro: Miguel]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Yeah, now that you're gone, gone, gone
I want you back



[Intro: 21 Savage]
I love you
Turn my headphone down a little bit, yeah
For so many reasons
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I do), yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah, ah, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you fuckin around with these thots? (A lot)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

[Interlude]
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]

Lights was out, the gas was off, so we had to boil up the water (Straight up)
Been through some things, but I couldn't imagine, my kids stuck at the border (Straight up)
Flint still need water (Straight up)
Niggas was innocent, couldn't get lawyers (On god)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch

[Interlude]
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[Chorus: 21 Savage]

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing a bet from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)

[Verse 4: 21 Savage]
Take a dive, put away my pride (‘Way my pride)
Shoot my shot, DMJ, I slide (Yeah, I slide)
She in front, but she used to be my side (Be my side)
We take selfies now, I used to in her Live (In her Live)
Before the fame, Plan B was robbin’ banks (Robbin' banks)
Be a married man, right now I just can’t (I just can’t)
All the love they gave me, knew that it was fake (It was fake)
Mama love me so much, either way I’m straight (Way I’m straight)
I done seen so many handshakes turn to hate (Turn to hate)
Seen so many BF’S turn S-N-A-K (Turn to snakes)
Death before dishonor tatted on my face (On my face)
Way I run the check up, should’ve been with Chase (Been with Chase)
Start at the bottom, the trenches, the gutter, so I had to go a lil' harder (Straight up)
Lights was off, the gas was off, so we had to boil up the water (Straight up)
Went through some things, but I couldn’t imagine my kids stuck at the border (Straight up)
Flint still need water (Straight up), niggas was innocent, couldn’t get lawyers (On God)

[Intro: Jeezy]
(Cryin', cryin', cryin')
Yeah, what’s up? (Yeah! What’s up?)
Welcome to America baby (uh)
Home of the brave, American Dream, you know? (yeah)
Uh, yeah, yeah
Let’s go

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (what's up?)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (I knew it nigga!)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (what's up?)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
You either good or you great, you either real or you fake
That's why I stay spittin' the real because the real ones relate
Y'all must was raised by some haters, you niggas go ahead and hate
F-F-Four car garage for the 'Rari, that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky, glad I ain't fall for the bait
So focused and I'm determined, can see that shit in my face
You niggas go 'head and face it, lil' bitch, ain't shit 'bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half, I got the recipe
First, my president was black, now my president is wack
I ain't never going broke, what's American in that?

[Chorus: Jeezy & J. Cole]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler (yeah)
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (alright)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (alright)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Got money to make, blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate, I'm running the game, you running in place
Still a youngin' at heart, but mentally, bitch I'm a hunnid'-and-eight
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety
I'm on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly 'cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
(Yeah yuh)
These streets made for ballin' (yeah yuh)
Ten toes ain't for fallin' (yeah yuh)
I hear the world callin'
Tell me if ya all in (tell me if ya all in)
Look, look, I gotta eat, I gotta, make money with
I gotta feast, I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah
I gotta eat, I gotta, make money with
I gotta feast, I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah



[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1]
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...


[Verse 2]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge]
Don't tell no lies, you can't deny
The beast inside
No girl don't lie, you can't deny
The beast inside
Just like animals
Just like animals

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
This is pain, this is love, this is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods, this was meant to be
You can run, you can hide, you can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You a part of me and I'm a part of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever

[Chorus + Bridge]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge]
Don't tell no lies, you can't deny
The beast inside
No girl don't lie, you can't deny
The beast inside
Just like animals
Just like animals



[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

Sing, oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

This is my canvas, sing!
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I

I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Breakdown]

[Outro]
Fayetteville I need y'all to make some motherfuckin' noise one time
Tonight, goddamn it for your motherfuckin' selves



[Verse 1]
Mann baichan ek jal rhi thi aag si
Shayad dil ko sata rhi teri yaad thi
Hai wo paas par fir bhi mere paas nhi
Har saans mein par diya kabhi dhyaan nhi
Kya aap samjhe sangeet ki ye baat thi
Jab na tha koi kalam kagaz hi saath thi
Mere vicharo ke the bane ye saathi
Inke bina zindagi meri jaise saza thi
Zimmedari nayi to shayad se door gya
Par na samjhe main tha unko kahi bhool gya
Mauka na mile main fir bhi dhoond laata hu
Chahe hun akela par khud ke liye hi gaata hu
Tu bhi jhaank teri bhi aisi cheez thi
Jiske liye rooh teri rehti thi cheekh ti
Par din ki race mein shayad bhool gya
Paisa matters more ban gya ye usool naya
Har din kama paisa thak kar so jaata hai
Par poocha hai mann se kya usko bhi chain aata
Reh kar door cheezo se jo deti ek sukoon thi
Chahe ho wo sardi ya fir ho wo garmi june ki
Par hua kya jo aisa hum badal gye
Kya ho kar bade hum thoda sa bhatak gye
Socha bohot par mil rha jaawab nhi
Chalo mil kar sochte hai main aur aap bhi

[Verse 2]
Haanji kya mila koi jawaab ji
Pooch khudse kya ho skti wajah thi
Roka khudko ya kismat ki khta thi
Ya socha tha sab baith ke ye ho jaayega aap hi
Ho skta hai samay na tere saath tha
Ho skta hai khuda tujhse naraaz tha
Ho skta hai khando par koi bhar tha
Yaa fir ho skta hai to kuch na karne ko tayaar tha
Kaaran bohot par zindagi ye aakhri
Aaj hai kal ban jaaye ye rakh hi
Himmat kar badal le kismat aap hi
Royega warna jab lega saans apni aakhri
Kehna aasan par karna thoda mushkil
Par rone se acha rahega wo khush dil
Hasegi na rooh na kahegi tujhe buzdil
Things will change atleast keep a strong will
Laga rahunga main apni aakhri saans tak
Koshish yahi pahunche aawaaz aap tak
Tu bhi karle sapne poore dekhe aaj tak
Koyla banega heera ye baat meri yaad rakh
Yaad rakh
Yaad rakh !!!

Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it
X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did A Milli, 50 did a milli
Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on Renegade, fucking awesome; applaud him!

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay Z]
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gang-banged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovate, ayyy

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay-Z]
Every day a star is born
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
And I am one of one
Can’t you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was duckin' one time
One time, give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey, Pres Carter
Watch them get they Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay
They come, they go, some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay Z]
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel, like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him
No sir, the flow's cold as the shoulders
Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for 'em!

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + J. Cole]
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Hey, hey, and clap for 'em! (I'm here now, Fayettenam)
Hey, hey, and clap for 'em!
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em!
Clap for 'em! J. Cole
Every day a star is born



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth
Now, if you was the last man walking on Earth
Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church
Hey…and clap for him…

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command



[Verse 1: Juicy J]
You been watching this nigga
Waiting on him to slip
You spot him at the light my nigga
In a Bentley while you creepin’ in that black Crown Vic
Pull up to the curb my nigga
Even out here balling and his family broke as shit
You think he give a fuck my nigga
Looking dead at a nigga down a barrel of your gun
Now look into his eyes my nigga
Will he die, will he live, will he beg like a bitch?
Or will he testify my nigga?
This is nigga hold it, Who gone catch it first
Somebody about to die my nigga
Niggas catchin’ grip on that gap
Make him wear chains on his neck
His face with diamonds, ice in his mouth
Fuck that nigga smile
Cause he knows that if you don’t let the choppers fly
He knows somebody gonna kill him on the other side
He knows somebody waitin’ all up in his momma house
He knows somebody
Fuck this baby momma now
It’s time for the come up
Nigga this it
Glock 19 15 in the clip
It’s up to you and God my nigga

[Hook: J. Cole & Juicy J]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Another day, another dollar
You spending on the car my nigga
Living fast, fuck the law
You ain’t worried about the cops my nigga
Your last hope you a father
You told to get a job my nigga
You just bought a new burden
The last one was hot my nigga
Everybody showing love in the streets
You a hood celebrity
Everybody knows that you’re the plug
You the nigga that they wanna be
But there’s somebody waiting on you my nigga
Don’t sleep
A black bag with a black man in a black crowd
Creepin’ on you
But you don’t give a fuck when you’re out in the streets
Dollars in the chain
Nigga you’re the hood grip
Hit the corner store for some lick
You close your eyes when you about to die
One of these niggas sound like you

No album to my name and I’m already hot
You could say I’m preheated
If money talks, mine telling yours to be seated
Cut my leg off, I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game, bitch
And you can retweet it
E-mail the shit, make sure you Cc it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I be in the airport, damn near barefoot
Security hollering out “Cole, we need it!”
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinking, I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain’t no fucking G, boy
Your style G-rated
Hatred is flattery, glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late, now it’s happy belated



[Intro]
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)
With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
Of Devil's pie

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres

[Bridge]
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'...

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

[Verse 2]
Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die
Uno dos

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart
And hope to die
With my slice of Devil’s pie



Recently there’s been a trend that includes rappers saying something offensive, only to be attacked for it in the media and pressured to apologize. I have to be completely honest and say there’s a part of me that resents that. I view rap similar to how I view comedy. It’s going to ruffle feathers at times. It’s going to go “too far”. I do not believe that an apology is needed every time someone is offended, especially when that apology is really only for the sake of saving an endorsement or cleaning up bad press.

With that said, this is not the case today. This letter is sincere.
This apology IS necessary.

In a recent verse on the song “Jodeci Freestyle”, I said something
highly offensive to people with Autism. Last week, when I first saw a comment from someone outraged about the lyric, I realized right away that what I said was wrong. I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant enough say something so hurtful. What makes the crime worse is that I should have known better.

To the entire Autism community who expressed outrage, I’m moved and inspired by your passion, and I’m amazed at how strong you are as a unit. I have now read stories online from parents about their struggles and triumphs with raising an Autistic child and I admire how incredibly strong you have to be to do so. It’s touching. It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real shame. You have every right to be angry.

To anyone suffering from Autism, either mildly or severely, I am sorry. I’m bound to make mistakes in my life, but in my heart I just want to spread Love.

I want to educate myself more on Autism, and I’ll gladly own my mistake and serve as an example to today’s generation that there’s nothing cool about mean-spirited comments about someone with Autism. People with this disorder and their loved ones have to go through so much already, the last thing they need is to hear something as ignorant as what I said. I understand.

To the parents who are fighting through the frustrations that must
come with raising a child with severe autism, finding strength and
patience that they never knew they had; to the college student with Asperger’s Syndrome; to all those overcoming Autism. You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere apology.

Much Love

-Cole



[Intro]
"Yeah, nigga
I'mma go ahead and murder this shit
Voice gone and shit, I think it's gon' make it sound a lil'–a lil' ill...
A lil' iller
Yeah, fayettenam... nigga."

[Verse]
Yeah, Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya na’ lie
My world a little darker, like a fuckin' tan line
Go on, look for a better nigga: girl you can’t find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma’am, I’m an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I’m armed and I’m Fayetnam’s finest
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion 'cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it’s all said and done I’mma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins. Bad chicks? Send em in
Basic hoes? Toss em out, can’t even get Waffle House
Hatin’ niggas? Chalk em out. Go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about? Lil man
My shit here burning, you not even lil’ tan
I’m ill enough to kill cancer: baby, I’m chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you-know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, "girl, I don’t care"
You better get yours fore I reach mine
Cause then I’m throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum: Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I’m quarterbacking, trying to get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever, Cole is like the leader
Of the new niggas, to tell the truth I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of you niggas get lapped, I sit back
And reflect on the rap game
I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out “The ‘Ville, I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that vagina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer
I could give a fuck as long as there’s something that’s behind of her
Got the type of bump that make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I’m the shit...oh yeah, I’m reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem
And I’m ghost



[Hook: J.Cole]
She’s a star if I ever seen one
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad
She got something I never had
I see ya looking at me

[Wale]
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now

[Verse1: Wale]
Wale and we are not the same
Got bread in the diesel, got diesel in the J
Rock Steady, me and my nigga Cole
Leave me a couple minutes, you leave me a couple hoes
Quite gifted, ambitions of life living
Despite living with more attention than light skinned, women
Ok you think a nigga shallow
Ok, you probably think I get ‘em all with the cash flow
Actually I like a broad that can bag hoes
Thats how I rope em all down
See my last ho (work)
Blast off (work)
Get involved
Gas women then return ‘em like a rental car
That's one show, that's fifty large
Nigga I just glow, bright as any DeBarge
I’m just tryna get ya comfortable
And its amazing what some liquor and a blunt’ll do

[Hook: J. Cole]
She’s a star if I ever seen one
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad
She got something I never had
I see ya looking at me
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World
Down for whatever
Boy got dollars, pounds or whatever
Being broke in this sadity ass world
Still found a way to get pretty ass girls
Killin’ y’all niggas, any last words
Cause you didn’t play the game right
Hey girl, before you throw it at me
You gotta make sure you aim right
Red dots cause I’m red hot
Seen, but damn girl you smoking
I get paper like I a mail box, seen
But girl you got me open
Proceed, pocket full of G’s
Kush, baby mama-less; yeah no seeds
Blow trees like a hurricane
Damn, if looks kill, then ya murderin’
Damn!

[Hook: J. Cole]
She’s a star if I ever seen one
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad
She got something I never had
I see ya looking at me
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club

[Verse 3: Wale]
I am what you want, cause you like what I make
I am what I am, and you is who I say
Go where you ain't been
No reservation
And most hoes be so-so when they hold no make-up
Yeah, I got the flow that they know is the truth
It’s getting ugly in here, guess I Kola'd the Boof
After the club, gettin you open
And I’m talkin, passenger action
I’m pulling you over
And you walkin
After the fact
It’s knowin’ it’s over
Now tomorrow you sober wishing you ordered a soda
I am more than the dopest
I’m forever improving
They can’t fuck with ya boy
Like a BYU Cougar
They 22′s or something
I’m brutal as a bazooka
And when the smoke clears don’t you dare ask who could
Or who did, cause I did
Bitch I’m here and I’m it
And I’m is what you ain't
Who’s iller, I’ll wait
Hold up!

[Hook: J. Cole]
She’s a star if I ever seen one
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad
She got something I never had
I see ya looking at me
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now



[Verso I: kvndido]
Amor é dor na flor que jaz no meu jardim
Flor que faz-me ser assim doido
Li nas entrelinhas verbas
Querem pôr um fim a mim mano
Perdem-se em linhas cegas
São merdas que não me assistem
Velas que eu cá não sopro
Só falo em prol de ter o meu lugar ao sol
Compara o solo eu vim aqui mas vim alone
Não falo em corpos, eu sou ouvido e não é pouco
Loopado em fones, não rezo a cristo eu sei o deal
Nunca tive em choque, com a ousadia desses crips
Que querem virar blood don't you know i'm loco
Smell ya later skunks, lá porque eu corro atrás do hash não me chamem james
Murda Murda Murda, Kill Kill Kill
Tou sem manners e estribeiras bills bills bills
Vão matando kids que virão manequims prontos a ser vestidos
Numa de investir nunca quis fazer jus a isto mas assim o fiz
Mandem disses, pisses, since 01' no fuckin snitching
Tenho o feeling que devia ser mais meigo com essas bitches
Quero pitar do cake mas eu sei que não fui feito pra esta deixa
Um conselho junta as mãos u better pray nigga

U better pray nigga, u better

Porque quando eu cansar do mic vou passá-lo ao naik pura
Verdade é vidrar na line tipo um pack é verdade pura

[Verso II: naik]
Bela vem lá po meu lado wella wild wine e bafos
Quela wella hella high ela tomba ela cai
E é sem trela que ela vai com bombay já safei
Quando cuspo é só fyah e ela vai contra a lei
Escondo o que a vida safa, cenas do quem é quem
E eu só sento no sofá e enquanto ela vem
Puxo e bebo pa contar o que se passou só mayday
Os dedos a trabalhar entre as ruas que passei
Beefs cruas beefs luas visões lúcidas papéis
Que pensas tu se as faz-se luz e assim vou dos 0 aos 100
São tantas núpcias na rua desta vida somos cães
A jazer sob a culpa e pesadelos infernais
É como ter uma corda à volta de quem tu queres mais
E a cada passo que tu dás aperta quem quer o teu bem
É uma vida sagaz, com satanás vou e venho
Depois relaxo contigo uns segundos e tu vens-te
Bela, cheia de notas cinderela
Danças nesse varão à procura da parcela
Com uma tela por pintar vais à vela na sequela
E quando tentas terminar acabas com um nó na goela
Bela, bela, bela, vai à janela bela (x2)



[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1: Wale]
Fresh out the airport, fresh out the chair with the clippers
Like Shaun Living', thinking, hmm
I'm tryna get it like Sean get it
If Lord giveth, a mil' and a MILF light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That Anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath
No joke, you see them boys sign me to the scope, right?

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal?
Ay, tell them niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And yeah, we heard you got it locked but like them socks, we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga, especially on your flows nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me, especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep, you see me, let me in
All I wanna do is eat, I'm like a freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV, need ESPN
They heard I'm 'bout to blow so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just passed the Patron
Ain't nothing given dawg, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light, I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise, kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet, and I never will, Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet, you up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog, I'm rough sex
I'm on deck, I'm up next, I'm God blessed, I'm success
So fuck stress, you can get the fuck from 'round me
And if you listening, know you wondering where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy, ay Wale, good looking

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 3: Wale]
Another day up in my ES, wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed, muscles
Your feedback ain't plusing, and you can keep it running
Ha, like a muffler, when we not in summer
They like A-list actors, they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function, I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting, showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a painting or a lakehead
This just how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or an I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up
Motherfucker, hah!

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1]
I hit the weed, I told myself the last time would be my last
I don’t trust my own niggas, now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass
Boy, you know my L’s dirty, if they stop me I’m goin' to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me
"Man, let me out, send me back to bitches that smell purdy"
And all I gotta do is call once and she 'dere all ready
Yeah, buddy, can't you tell I'm goin; through hell
I don’t even open my mail
I’m in the shower with soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now i’m getting plenty money

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 2]
Look kid, its raining outside boy
Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin’
Cole the wrong one bringin’ the city shine
All he ever doin’ is paintin’ pictures of crime
Tellin’ stories of pain, paintin’ pictures of dope
Bitch if you listenin' I’m paintin’ pictures of hope
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin’ my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin’ the streets hey ma I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin’ hoes, was out hoopin’
Them niggas wasn’t ballin’ but yet they was foul shootin’
So meet the newest role model who don’t know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Outro]
Girl it’s been so long, I’ve been gone from you
But you ain’t gotta worry ’bout the thangs I do
It’s hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon’ know our name
Ain’t seen you smile in awhile
But I been dreamin’ ’bout you



[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my niggas die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying to pull away.  At no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took off running

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired 7 more shots and my friend died

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free



[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no X-Ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my people die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 3]
Forget this chain, cause this ain't me
Though I'm eternally grateful to Jay Z
We so elated, we celebrated like Obama waited until his last day in office to tell the nation, brothers is getting their reparations, hey
A man can dream, can't he?
No disrespect, in terms of change I haven't seen any
Maybe he had good intentions but was stifled by the system
And was sad to learn that he actually couldn't bring any
That's what I get for thinking, this world is fair
They let a brother steer the ship
And never told him that the ship was sinkin'
But I got other shit to think about, like my bank account
Forget that watch, you paid too much for it
You 'ought to be ashamed
When brothers back home be dreading when the seasons change
Cause they ain't got no heat and they ain't got no AC
WalMart distribution fired my homie, he just had a baby
You wonder why it's been so many B and E's lately
While brothers from the hood shooting like this is TNT lately
And since all the ballers leaving college early
I turn on the TV and don't see no brothers with degrees lately

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Outro]
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off...



Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrows
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rose
Playing Jigga hits he say good, make more those
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digiornos
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the 'caine
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I've done been a nerd
Just to tutor bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I'm just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got her coming now he might've been the first
So she only fuck with hymn/him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you're black they won't employ ya'
Well nigga I'mma show ya', this that Jesse Jackson
Af-firmative action so master I'm taxing uh
Don't let the cover fool ya', bitch I ain't no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don't gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a Ville nigga 'til the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know what I paid for this shit? bitch, you got damn right!



[Part 1: Love Yourz]

Journey wit me, won’t ya come searchin’ wit me?
Cross the bridges if you with it, or come burn ‘em wit me
If you don’t find a place beside us, please turn against me
I’m ‘bout to take a life turn, swervin’ permanently
I let the rap addiction inspirit a Catholic Christian
The addict don’t got it all up here, it appears
But no fear, I’ll do this after death and visit you as apparition
Eternal melodies, and that’s the mission
Never catch me slippin’, I found a lake to fish in
Dismiss the fake who livin’, I cast ‘em out
And tell ‘em they should keep it real - great decision
See, I’m just tryna fly my message out to ya’ll like a faithful pigeon
Baby, listen. We’re put here to make a difference
And I just stay wishin’, that I was Gandalf the Grey wit wisdom
You really gotta stop adherin’ to the shady system
Those dollar signs in your eyes gave you jaded vision
But me, I save and spit, this what I do for recreation
Slash soul restoration, Debit savings
I let the record play while the teller counts
Rather have you check the bounce than have to hear your check has bounced

[Part 2: Fire Squad]

Switch to cast the thrall, I’m the master, after all
Words splash like cannonballs, minds turn to applesauce
Sweeter than a Macintosh, talkin’ like a jabberjaw
Goin’ down like Santa Clause, wired in like analogs
Girls that used to sleep on your boy are still sleepin’
But now, it’s with pajamas off, make it clap like mad applause
This is the result of watchin’ too much rap battle, doll
Pick and choose flows like my mind’s a giant catalog
Movin’ on, I’m the whitest boy you’ll ever get to know
Whiter than the driven snow, whiter than a sniff of blow
Thinner than a piccolo, as thin as stripper pole
So women hear me and get the urge to start strippin’, though!
Pick and roll, give and go, I’m the point guard
Flows make sense and get changed more than Coinstar
And if you sayin’ to yourself this go hard
Tha Art Exhibit’s magnificent, but you still standing in its courtyard
Cuz I've got...

[Part 3: Can't Get Enough]

Unlimited rhymes, a million times infinity signs
Jiminy cricket, equip a killer design, I deserve just a little ity bit of a shrine
Like, it ain’t no thing, praise be the king
Droppin’ hot lines, but I stay away from the bling
Got my puppet show below, I’m just pullin’ ‘dem strings
Keep the theme shinin’, let the spirits just sing
Sing, Sing, like yodeling, no, Sing Sing, with the bars I bring
Got Generic handling all the R&D, plus Tha Character for all of that marketing
But I switch flows quicker than gym clothes
Hypno-sis, I’m the hip-hop minstrel, I love it
Protectin’ your lymph nodes, I does it
You won’t ever reach my summit, shove it
Puzzlin’ wit every double time dropped
But I rhyme hot, never let the grind stop or hit a dry spot
Rollin’ through the city in a Hyundai, why am I
Not pullin’ to the stop sign in a Maybach
Ah, ah, oh… and I don’t know
Skill level developed has been optimal
Only thing that I can think that’s left to do
Is start droppin’ flows at every concert show
.Like watch out below, Geronimo
I got a yahtzee rolled, it’s all possible
I’m like Han Solo, you under my control
I got the rap game in my 2pocket, though!

[Part 4: In The Morning]

Slow burnin’ while the globe turnin’
Lyrics smoother than butter, I got your soul churnin’
No, no, no worries, stay dough earnin’
Closed eyes, welcome home journey
Yeah, boy, my flow’s furnished
Cold world, but the fire in my heart is flamin’
People slump, and I’m just makin’ sure my art is changin’
I like the money, but my soul’s a greater influence
Sacrifice the green for white to see how far my power rangin’
The almighty soldier, I tend to write it sober
Smile at ‘em like I’m nice and kosher
I hit with the joy, stick to it ‘em like controllers
Whitey Bulger doin’ it until I’m signin’ posters, hold up
It’s good to meet you, baby, you wanna be my lady?
I like to rap, do you think you could adapt?
I don’t think so, crawlin’ outta bed
Words spill out while I’m yawnin’
So can I spit it in the mornin’
Can I spit it in the morning?
Can I spit it in the morning?
Recording session while you're moanin'
Can I spit it in the morning?
Can I spit it in the morning, baby?
Can I spit it in the morning?
The sun risin' while recordin', babe
Generic



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
See your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
What she do, double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how man dogging me
My best friend say, don't tell her nothing 'bout me and you
Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy
My best friend say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I’ll be there, I’ll still be there for you

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me
We breaking up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, than you start listening
To friends, and then it, gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

[Bridge]
My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
I’ll still be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling, let me know whats on your mind
We’ve been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I’m never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey



[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Now I was
Sitting on a mountain of dilemmas
Guzzling 40 ounces to the liver
Thinking about my life my life
How I was living in strife
We would be out all night
In front of my building
In the gutter the impoverished civilians
It was life or death
I was just trying to make a killing
Jobs wasn't hiring
Mama lost her mind again
Daughter needed diapers
And daddy needed a Vicodin
Baby girl getting older
And it won't be long
Til she got the weight of the world on her shoulders
Try to be calm
This chronic prevent me from doing niggas bodily harm
Gotta remind me I'm Shawn
Cuz sometimes I be lost
Fantasizing about cars
Go to sleep with a picture of a Maserati on my wall
From them projects and buildings
To a yacht and some slippers
Had them Christopher Wallace intentions
I had to get it

[Hook (2X)]
Big dreams, big dreams the whole city was mine
Big dreams, big dreams, Benz, beepers and 9's
Big dreams, big dreams, the only limit's the sky
Got me feeling like the world is mine
Now close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Now everybody has a dream
But not every man has a plan
For some it becomes a reality
Slight chance but hey
You, you take it for what it's worth
Even if it just so happens your face end up in the dirt
Where I'm from the definition of work
Is a zipper some purp, or a key of that girl
I swear the city's bizerk
Wanted to travel the world
Leave a dent on this earth
I guess a nigga in search
Always trying to find an exit
Was tired of living reckless
In my mind envisioned myself driving in a Lexus
Uh, you'll know ya nig got it made
When the cops never raid and the crib got a maid
Why life as a shorty gotta be fucked up?
I just want what's mine I ain't asking for much
I mean, I had dreams and rapping was one
It was either that or ski mask and a gun
But you don't hear me tho

[Hook (2X)]

[Outro: Fashawn + J. Cole]
Know what I'm saying
Close your eyes man
Picture that man
Close your eyes and envision this
You know what I'm saying
It's the life
It's a Cole world
Big cars, expensive linen
You know what it is
Grizzly City to the Ville nigga
Real niggas connect
Know what I'm saying respect
Fayettnam all the way to Grizzly City nigga
Big Dreams
It's the F

[Intro: J. Cole]
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

You know who this is dedicated to

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez

[Verse 1: Bas]
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?
Bitch, I don't care
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Got a bitch like a diamond
Bitch got no flaws
See the switch when she walk
Give the bitch an applause
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want
Fly to another continent if I want
Ride through the projects if I want
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, TDK, TDK
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite
I don't talk much, but I say a lot
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot
When we sweating in the dark don't run
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run
She a square but that ass rotund
She let me cut samurai shogun
Know you heard bout the backstroke
I can make your perm turn to an afro
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches
Nice girls, classy women
I'm too official
Dreamville, nigga too official
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

Ten toes to the ground

[Hook 1]
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight these demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain? blaow
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight them demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?

[Verse 1]
If I quote it nigga, I wrote it nigga
Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga
Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga

[Hook 2]
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?
(Right there let me get that there
Talk about it)
Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?
(Talk about it)
Nada
(If you really believe it, gotta talk about it
You heard about what happens when you talk about it
Niggas lookin’ at you funny when they start to doubt it
Fucking up your energy when you start to doubt it too)
Rollercoaster ride
(Start to doubt it too)
How much do it cost?
(Start to doubt it)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost
(Shoutout my nigga Ib)
Rollercoaster ride, how much do it cost?
(El Presidente and shit)
(He want me to talk my shit for y'all)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost

[Verse 2]
Cole world you should stay off this dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand

[Outro]
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker
"When you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...
(Censor Tone)



[Intro]
Dick hard like Rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

[Verse]
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Hiiigher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God-bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha)

If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, "Self Made 3", let's go

[Hook: Wale]
Folarin in this muh'fucker
I'm just talking to you muh'fuckers
If it don't make y'all niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I groom better
Like I'm under a goal post, I am too officials
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, little nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind, but they end up on my dick, haha
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though
Try to hit the Jummah, Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said, "You winning, why BOA pray so much?"
I say, "You tripping, such winnin make niggas prey on us"
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never-ending revenue hunt

[Hook: Wale]
Folarin in this muh'fucker
Still talking to you muh'fuckers
If it don't make y'all niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, I did it for my family
I'ma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught me done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album, it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want it like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat'
You get that? Look like I went diamond just where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, aw, how you get that far?
Cause when I ran out of gas, I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash, I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferraris just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills, niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Nah, give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Yeah, nigga don’t be a statistic
Have yo main bitch sending me pictures
Feeling futuristic, might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah, nigga I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If you're a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch, yeah
And it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back, uh

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole World, zip your coat up tight
I put your soul on nice, illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like
It's cold, Young C.O., L.E., call me Neo
And if I ain't the one, I'm the prototype
Woo, insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog-eat-dog world nigga, we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimme nigga
Once poor, now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got pennies for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest, this a hell of a start

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Cole, World, nigga
Double M-G, Dreamville shit

[Hook: Wale]
Folarin in this muh'fucker
Still talking to you muh'fuckers
If it don't make y'all niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Intro]
Black heaven is a place where people like me go
Up there in black heaven, black heaven

[Verse 1: Boosie]
Know Dr. King still preachin' about togetherness
But probably lookin' down sayin' it's irrelevant
Whitney Houston, she was heaven sent
A song bird prolly smilin' right now listenin' to her own words
Rosa Parks so much heart, she an OG
Know she smilin' lookin' at the blacks in the front seat
Bernie Mac jokin' right now, him and Richard Pryor
Trayvon prolly lookin' down sayin' them niggas wild
I know who givin' knowledge up there, 2Pac
He lookin' down like what happened to this hip hop?
Biggie Smalls prolly swagged out, laid back
Him and Eazy talkin' bout how it was way back
Nate Dogg prolly reminicin' about the A-Trak
Pimp sayin' prayers that Bun and Jay stay strapped
Michael Jackson? He prolly maxin' and relaxin'
Him and Marvin Gaye makin' a classic

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
I know you smilin' down up there in black heaven
I know you're really proud of me up there in black heaven
I know you smilin' down on me in black heaven
Thinkin' of you til the day we meet again

[Verse 2: Boosie]
Billie Holiday thinkin' about the old days
Johnny Taylor makin' mixes with the Ojays
Rodney King prolly thinkin' bout his old ways
Thinkin' bout how they burned the city down bout his old case
Malcolm X prolly wishin' he was down here
To take our hoods back from the people who ain't from round here
James Brown still hollin' it's a man's world
But thinkin' damn all these girls takin' man's girl
Know Jackie Neal talkin' bout how people roll
Know Tooki Williams still stickin' to the G code
Wilt probably still saying nobody broke his record
Mac Dre still represent as a bay legend
Know I and Bleek prolly talkin' bout me
Them niggas prolly jam with Big Stone, out the three
DJ Screw lookin' down at the culture that he started
Rest in peace Bob Marley

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
I know you smilin' down up there in black heaven
I know you're really proud of me up there in black heaven
I know you smilin' down on me in black heaven
Thinkin' of you til the day we meet again

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Where do my niggas go to when they pass?
And why do good niggas never last?
Some get addicted to the fast route
The hand in hand, you know that cash route
I pray to God that we see better days
I caught a record while the record plays
I'm thinkin' Lord don't let 'em carry me
See I know one day when they bury me
I'll go straight to black heaven, black heaven
Yeah I go straight to black heaven, black heaven
Don't let the paranoia get to me
Can't take a trip to penitentiary
I make a flip and take the summer off
A half a brick? Now that's a somersault
I look to God, it's been along road
I got my braid up, like a cornrow
I've been through hell, one day I'll find my way
If not then maybe I can buy my way to black heaven



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?

[Outro]
Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up



[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 1]
Hey, I came up
I warmed up, the next up
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Now don’t it sound legendary
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up and bitch I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say: "What you fighting for? The game is on life support"
And Gary Coleman just passed: life is short
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early just to get in free
And wait for hoes to show up
But now its bottles at them tables, bring the models boy
I’m about to po’ up
Uh ha, you know what
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Left side, left side
Right side, right side
Left side, left side, hey

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 2]
Mama said I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever
Ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go
Hit the club she drop it low
Lower than my credit score
Account overdraft what I got this debit for
So much debt it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle
You border like Mexico
Hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at?
And what ya cook like?
She said "where ya bread at
And what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other well brother good night"

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 3]
Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles
You mean to tell me everything gon be fine
If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you could blow up
And maybe you could blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up



La, la la la, la la
La, la la la, la la la

Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up

Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side uh huh
Left side, left side, hey
Bitch I'm about to blow up

Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up

[Intro: Sample + Cedric The Entertainer]
"Cruising down the river; dancing till your feet got numb; cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement park—ah, memories of Boblo Island."
All is your world ain’t nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut. Just jealous of everybody that’s headed out on that Boblo boat. It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks. Aw, man, I wish I was joining you—a little cheese and crackers, a little Cana wine, a little Riunite on ice, some Harvey’s Bristol Cream—but let’s do this, only on Smooth FM. 

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9″]
Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this hand-me-down-shit; I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me anti-bitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back ‘fore I was born
Pop told stories ’bout it that would last for hours-long
And as a family, we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the Boblo boat
Uh, on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters, crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh, smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass, waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the Boblo boat
That’s where I lost my virginity, no condom, though
That’s when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest, though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the Boblo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics, though, the Boblo boat

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey, lil’ Craig, come here. Aye, hit this, nigga. Nigga, don’t worry ’bout what the fuck it is, just drink!

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Yeah yeah, yeah
Some of my better times, I shared with you
I shared with you, yeah
Shit, all of my better days, I shared with you
I shared with you, shit
And now I gotta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shit, stuck inside a rat race (fuck)
Rat race (fuck, fuck)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race (fuck)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, look
Twist the cap, lift the bottle back, swig it
Dig it, ten-inch rims on my mama’s Civic
Ten-inch woofers in the trunk, to be specific
They bump, rattle the license plate, plus the windows tinted
Don’t even give a fuck that it’s dented, bitch, I’m the man now
I’m rolling, driving it slow as if it’s stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci, let’s check her
Double D’s like double-deckers, I wanna sex her
But these keys don’t come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college, I’m under pressure
I’m not a real nigga ’til I undress her, I gotta ‘press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays, I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My real-life trauma plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but that’s insane, it couldn’t be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap, you never heard it better
Give me a sec, I murder sectors, prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it, but it spill out, I gotta chill out
Say “Fuck the world” and never pull out
We had no Boblo boat but I could note
Those times is like a Bible quote
BC, before cell phones, the first time I would smoke
I was six years old, but that’s for another chapter
That’s for another story, to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking ’bout them days
Thinking ’bout them days

[Outro]
This is; 808-Ray
Nigga don't worry about what the fuck it is, just drink

[Produced by 808-Ray and Cool & Dre]



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point us right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music business is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane"; My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: J. Cole]
This shit is a gift

[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
"Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made"
You know what he'd say? "You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit," hah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

[Interlude]
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)



[Verse 1]
Yeah
Yeah

Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down
Uh, break the break down...

Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down...



[Hook: J. Cole]
I don't know what you heard 'bout nigga

You screaming loud with that beef talk

The streets talk and they saying you fake now
So when them boys pull up you better break out
You better break out, nigga
Better break out
You better break out nigga

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Young gifted and black a nigga stay on his grind, that money stay on my mind
That’s what I say all the time, a nigga swear on his mom
And I don’t pay y’all no mind; no I’m just lettin’ us speak
A lot of niggas I know will leave your head on your sneaks
I should be stepping with priests the way I’m blessing these streets
Now nigga bow to the king, playa, I’m out of your league
Carolina my heart, and now I’m making my mark
I’m headed straight to the stars, you niggas taped to the floor
Haters hate when I’m raw, they rather see me dissolve
Don’t wanna see me on TV; they rather see me shut off
They rather see me do bad, I’m asking, “nigga is you mad cause you trash? I flew past?”
Fucking loose ass niggas, News flash for y’all I’m too fast for y’all
Talking bad, niggas wouldn’t shoot basketballs
The flow will blow you away, now niggas know you a fake
You looking for money, come on nigga I’ll show you the way

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard 'bout nigga
Where I'm from, that shit'll get you murked out nigga
Screaming loud with that beef talk
Them niggas bring it to you, you gon' wanna peace talk
The streets talk and they saying you fake now
So when them boys pull up you better break out
You better break out, nigga
Better break out
You better break out nigga
Better Break out

[Verse 2: Omen]
You better know how we drop, come on we flooding your block
Snucka you come with the cops, sucka you something we not, bluffing
We number one slot runners, come and your stock plummet
Stuntin’ on your chicken, yo we flyer than top gunners
Mine is on big things, I’m fly with a slick ring
I leave the imprint on foreheads like Rick James
Punk you spit lame, bum you insane
I tell your chick that I’m dumb so I can get brains
Comin’ from Chi-town where playas get shot down
Leg on the block found from raiders and cops now
Haters have calmed down
We major, we dropped down, on fakers and pop clowns
Pray that we stop now, never that day come
Been reppin’ since day one, the Chi where I stay son
The place that where you stay from, don’t try to play dumb
I’m from where the apes from, if you ever see them let us out of our cage, run

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard 'bout nigga
Where I'm from, that shit'll get you murked out nigga
Screaming loud with that beef talk
Them niggas bring it to you, you gon' wanna peace talk
The streets talk and they saying you fake now
So when them boys pull up you better break out
You better break out, nigga
Better break out
You better break out nigga
Better Break out



[Verso1]
22 anos, um diploma, mais um neguinho do bairro
Me sinto um judeu em Sodoma
Toma, pega essa bomba, toma é armamento
Não é aquilo que as crianças usam
Pra gastar seu tempo

SPOTLIGHT, FLOW SIMONAL
Lucas anti DOPS, não, não uso nada ilegal
Aqui o mundo anda mal, então soltem suas pedras
Temos o sujo e o mal lavado e todo mundo erra

O senhor observa, pretos prontos pra guerra
Eu vim pra ser espelho, esvaziar a favela
Lotar a high society, pretos em festa
Seu olho gordo não me atinge
Quer um pedaço peça

E sem usar uma peça, lotamos geladeiras
Se é motivo de festa, irmão cê tá de brincadeira
Essa é a hora da reviravolta, acabo com a zueira
Pra jogar meu bairro lá em cima
Subo qualquer ladeira

[Refrão]
Eu, vou subir junto com os meus
Há quanto tempo no breu

Eu, só ando junto dos meus
Quem que ficou depois que o teto desceu

Deus, olha pra mais um filho teu
Há quanto tempo no breu

Eu, vou subir junto com os meus
Quem que ficou depois que o teto cedeu

DEUS

[Verso 2]
Não adianta reclamar
Problemas são só problemas
Cê vai ter que se virar
Cansei do busão lotado

Um inferno pra trabalhar
Já chego no trampo cansado
E tem patrão pra escutar
Não entende meu lado

Quer resultado vamo lá
Levantei minha cabeça
Me elevei, outro lugar, então querendo ou não
Eles vão ter que aceitar

Mais um preto outra rima
Comprando o que quer comprar
Tipo pantera negra
Lucas Shakur, preto jaguar
Saquei tudo, sem sacar, levei tudo sem roubar
Tia distribui no bairro pras crianças brincar

Fala que alguém trabalhou e comprou
Não precisou roubar e que é nesse tipo de alguém
Que eles tem que se inspirar

Pra subir, pra cantar, pra resistir, representar
Se informar, se formar, pra sua mãe se orgulhar
E lembrar a favela que aqui também é um bom lugar

[Refrão]
Eu, vou subir junto com os meus
Há quanto tempo no breu

Eu, só ando junto dos meus
Quem que ficou depois que o teto desceu

Deus, olha pra mais um filho teu
Há quanto tempo no breu

Eu, vou subir junto com os meus
Quem que ficou depois que o teto cedeu

DEUS

[Ponte]
Sei que não esquece de mim, pai
Mais é tão frio aqui
Eu choro, a chuva cai
Mais te invoco, teu nome invoco
E eles verão teu poder
Entre os nossos



[Bridge]
I wasn't looking for you
I wasn't searching
I wasn't creeping around
I wasn't lurking
I wasn't sleeping around
I wasn't thirsting
But, I got a thang for you
I got a thang for you

[Verse 1: J Cole]
You on ya job, and it's damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you
Hey, baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make a man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through ya city, I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminding you of Friday
I can take you to DC introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parle, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room, we call this do the hard way, hard way!

[Hook]
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend

Bring em in (x4)
And if they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the grrr! It's just you, me, and them

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl you lookin' like the new Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
A stewardess and yet you flew the leer
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for ya
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catchin' bodies
How I'm stretching you, guess no need to go get pilates
When I'm sliding through ya city, meet me in the lobby
And you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the morning? while you moaning probably
Got you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a hobby
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy
Don't mind me, I put it down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J Cole]
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons
Whisper to ya home girls you love Cole World
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse you know
The type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf footballs
I got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth
Because I'm so clever better than ho-eva
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed, the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (Ahhhh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's 0-11, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you so fed up, and so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header
I won't let up

[Hook]



[Verse 1: J. Cole]

Peep this shit I got my 20's

If you want to be King then I suggest you vote for Bun
A real nigga know, when a real nigga's done
If you want to be a King then I suggest you vote for Bun
Like that



[Intro: Keri Hilson]
One for the paper, two for the money

(Oh, we gonna give it to 'em now baby, hey!)

No, you can't use the phone, baby

Was lookin' for a man to hold me down

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, caged bird
Some'n' like a caged bird
Caged bird
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You ain't a man till you stop chasing your friends, my nigga
Think for yourself, make your own plans, my nigga
I'll be lying if I said I ain't understand, my nigga
'Cause who you gon' follow when the leaders all get swallowed
By reefer clouds and bottles
In and out of county jail
This is hell, see the young black males in packed cells
With they heads down
And they fists clenched tight
Thinking, "I could bust a hole through this wall
And, bitch, I just might."
It's just like the caged bird; I sing a song
Hoping they open up these bars and send a nigga home
I cry when I'm alone
I'm wondering why would God send me here
Knowing that they hate us
Knowing that they make us feel like we evil so we kill our people
Without a second thought, in every lesson taught by OGs
We full of real nigga wisdom, so we proceed
Like real niggas who been stripped of our humanity
I see the judge's eyes, I know that he ain't understanding me

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage

[Verse 2: Omen]
Well, it's the oratory vet
Turned down king slash poet laureate
Used to paint a picture with a story of neglect
I could've been a shorty drinking 40s on the steps
With a shorty on my lap
With a shorty on the way coming shortly to protect
I could've been a dealer in the party with the X
But I'm hardly in the mix and I partially confess
I definitely got a couple parts in me that I regret
Is the cup half-empty or is it half-full?
I fill mine up with Hennessy, then get back to him
I'm just a jazz musician trapped in a rap form
You think you standing for something you on a trap door
Well it's the, Mr. Introspective
I'm a dreamers dream, a sort of an inception
I never fiend for the scene but I dreamed of the things
That a Mercedes brings, like slow sex with fast women
Drinking cognac I'm past grinning
A sexy dress, fat ass in it
But still hit it till I'm half-winded
Cause niggas tell me I'm the shit when I be hitting all these dimes
See I'm caged by the visions of the blind
I started as a king
Turned to a slave
Put us in our chains
We was forced to entertain
Thinking bout the present day I'm living off the stage
Wonder if a nigga ever get up out this cage
As I sing

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage



[Intro]
Yeah
It's therapist
The golden child
Yeah
Peep what I'm saying
Yo, yo, check it, yo

[Verse 1]
Yeah you cats is fly but your plane is crashing
You came and passed
My range blasting
I came slashing
Same fashion
That OJ stabbed him
My brain's packed with more lines than caine addicts
These insane raps should stay wrapped in a Straitjacket
You featherweight class bitch
Don't want mine
That's why your whole squad is telling me
"Pick on someone your own size"
I got the whole nine
Ain't perfect but I'm border lining
My album come with a surgeon general's warning on it (Sick)
I spit a born vomit
The hot shit
Even when I die shit
I'll still be the livest
Quit with the nonsense
You hating but you feeling it though
Stepped on stage
Got arrested for stealing the show
Stealing the zone
Never left it
Niggas never contested
On a five star scale you get one less then Texas (Get it)
I got narcoleptics
Why the whote now
When this shit goes down
Niggas barely show up when I show down
I hold ground
Go more rounds than carrousels
And you beating me only happens in fairy tales
You dreaming
My pieces is so dope you feinding
That Cole flow you sink
When I dive off the deep end
I'm head hunting
Heads front
But ain't said nothing
So heads up or spill red blood cause your head is gushing
Bitch what
No STD's
But still a sick fuck
You blast from point blank range and never hit once
I'm heaven sent
From devilish
To Specialist
You niggas couldn't make a good impression of what cements
So throw up the white flag
No need to fight back
Drop your mic
Head to the freezer
And grab the knife pack
Get your lights snatched
I'm cold as the ice cap
Sold my soul to satan
Turned around and stole it right back
I'm jacking dead broke folks cause I'm dirt poorer
I tried to ball but fouled out in the first quarter
Flagrant rhymes
The facts that you proclaiming
They aiming the same phrase as mine
Taking the same frame of mind
I'm out to shine on any track that I'm hopping on
Changing album names
The false alarm
It's not the bomb
The style is off the wall
Kick shit like Bandhan
Therapist is the man
Hands down like a handstand
With a grand flow and my heart had to follow
I'm so ahead of my time I wrote this rhyme tomorrow, what



[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do
Uhh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm tryna get with ya girl, I ain't even going stunt
Miss Fat booty, man I seen it from the front
I mean that shit was pumped, had me fiending from the jump
And that ass was right, shit would make a fag look twice
So I approach like “shawty , whats good with cha?”
Nigga was hopin’ to go back to the hood with ya
And yeah I see them other niggas tryna look at cha
Wouldn’t slang the thing right even if they could get ya
Me I’m from the Ville where we learn how to mack well
And you gon’ yell when I hit it from the back well
Take you to the crib and throw on a little Maxwell
Grab a condom know cause, shit, I don’t know you that well
Haa, was fucking with that
Far from hater but see dem brothers was wack
So don’t you worry bout them mean muggin’ girl
I’m tougher than that
And niggas mad cause this light skinned brotha is back
I’m sayin’ though

[Hook & Interlude]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Stripes on the Polo
On the late night, fucking your wife on the low low
My pipe like a pogo stick, no homo
No ice but I’m cold though
Cologne on my nuts in case she might wanna go low
I’m from the Ville where niggas fight for the dolo
So think twice or take the same advice from the fo’fo’
Me running to PoPo and muthaf-ckin’ no go
A Carolina nigga, I’m the muthaf-ckin logo
Shit, fly as hell on my ozone shit
Disrespect me nigga you could get your cornroll split
And that goes for you too, I’m on my Bono shit
Niggas got no delivery thats that Digiorno shit
I got porno chicks callin’, I still neglect them nigga
I’m about my money like a bill collector
For you slow niggas I put it more in laymans
If you ain't talkin’ money its a foreign language
But uh, shawty can I get wit cha

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T



[Intro: J. Cole & Lauryn Hill]
One day, you're gonna understand...
Can I holla at you? Let me holla at you!

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Special, never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a, son to his mother
Or a, sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don't even speak
But know it's love though
Could never let em' dirty your name
I got the utmost respect for you
Came back home and had to check for you
Word round town is you locked down
Some older nigga snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be—
She like, "If you was me you wouldn't wait for me
Living fast and wouldn't mash the brakes for me"
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me
The day you played my momma you played me
Can't believe I let you in my heart nigga
I should've, followed my instincts a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sense danger in my house
I was too young to scrap you but damn if I ain't want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you
Uh, thirteen years knew you more than my real pops
Put me on to 'Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops
Who would've thought you'd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga "why you lie?"
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppings
Heard you tryna' talk, tell that punk don't call me
You ain't shit and I'm scared it rubbed off on me

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit I hope it ain't true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you
Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don't know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing, you expecting me to act strange
Ain't holla but you on my mind nigga
I dont forget the good times nigga
White tee's in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
We had potential to be monumental, 'ville mentality
You know that old kill or be killed mentality
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin' hoes like the old days, but now we overseas, dawg
Congratulations on your seed
Yo my nigga, can I holla at you?

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—



[Hook: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're a player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air



[Verse 1]
Yeah
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could
Said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first little taste of paper and I splurged
I guess it's just a nigga urge
This is The Boondocks
I swear, yo, I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be tryna save the world, and then on Friday, I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting, damn
Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes, I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live,  my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ay, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me

[Bridge]
But oh no, Lord
You see, I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?
Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be goddamned if I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'ma make it to the top
So I'ma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop

[Verse 2]
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?

Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it

Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in Hell
(Better off in Hell)

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Miseducated, unemployed, get deployed in a week
Them snatch my body and my soul was exploited for free
Now occupations getting sold, shipped and sold overseas
Can't trust nobody like at all, to make sure I'm gone eat
All I see is distractions, distractions
My life just keep flashing and I'm flashing
Blue lights get behind you
And your little blood pressure start to climate up
My niggas be speaking in spirit, schooling me on timing (heh)
I went to sleep thinking them caves with spiders on my eyelids
So, so, so... So what you know 'bout shining? (heh)
Lord I've been dancing for days, hell I'm still shaking off slave
Beneath and dipped in diamonds
She claim I be so zoned and I can't leave her for one moment (heh)
Really I be so floated, carrier of these components
Of life and I still be trying to make sense of that jibber jabber
You right, I can tie this 'round my neck
Floating up that corporate ladder (uh)
Whether the levels matter or realistic I'd rather be a misfit
We get it crackin', we sip, mechanic actions
But I can't call it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?

I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell

[Verse 2: Bas]
Heavy duty, Hell on Earth
We've been feeling Heaven's duties
Even with these demons on us
Journey deep into atonement
Through the edges of my mind
I cannot give you my mind state
That shit like going on blind dates
I don't know how that bitch look
I could've been took, I'm keeping divine fate
Follow the lines straight and narrow
Never been one of my fine traits
I just been living the road, I don't got no home
I cannot define safe, 'rounding the bases I live in the times
Few of my niggas is running it with me
We've been surviving and keeping alive
Thankin' you God, God's great
Give me a pond, now lakes upon us
Look at the water inside your eyes
You have been stuck in a blind state
Most of us out here just nickel and dime
Cook up a trip of the crime rate
But that's by design and we never snooze
Now I'm so awake, come step in my shoes, nigga

[Refrain: EarthGang]
Can't call it, can't call it

[Interlude: Earthgang & J. Cole]
Let me get that last, that last
Let me get that last, that last
Can't call it, can't call
Can't call it, can't call
Can't call it, can't call

[Verse 3: J.I.D]
Uh, so far I done, uh, yeah, so far I done
Okay, so far I done managed to take advantage
I set a goal and of course it ain't take off like how I planned it
Granted I want the globe and the planet where my hands is
Granted, I'm on my toes and I'm sick of standing
Sick of the bicker back and forth
The lifted pitch inside your voice
Cause I can't afford a picket fence and a porch
If I get in a pickle, I pull the pistol out my shorts
Payback on a pussy boy, so give me mines and give me yours
Give me time and let me finish to design the method
Enemy, the line, I stepped it
Point me in the wrong direction
Digging in the mind connecting
Everything I ever seen, ever done
Never was trying to set the gas to the fire
I prepped it, walking in shit that I stepped in

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell

[Verse 4: Doctur Dot]
Activated (Activated, activated, aw man)
Native language, middle finger
How ironic? (How ironic, how ironic, aw man)
What it take to get it when you know you got it?
How you operating when you know your calling?
Glad he raised me 'cause I know my papa wasn't sober often
I ain't judging, woo, I get high
Now I'm the best to break out and lead 285
Sticking my chest out, putting my deuce up
Losing respect for the one's you like
Back in Georgia we whip it slow
Get pulled over and you could die
Fuck the bullshit, fuck the cool shit
Grab the burner, let's use our rights
Let's get rid of these fools tonight
What a decision, what a commitment
What are the limits when you decide?
Pop the moon-roof, ain't your voodoo
Hit the crib, get danky coo coo
Certified I could lead the new school
Word to Tribe, whole team is Zulu

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
(Can't call it, can't call it)
Oh, I had so many days of pain
(I never came from deep pockets)
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
(Why can't I make a deposit?)
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
(I can't call it, uh! I can't call it)
I can see the future that we're heading

[Intro]
Yeah
Need y’all niggas to feel me, yo
Feel my pain
Said soft niggas can’t last hard times, yo
Believe that shit
Yeah, (Yeah) aye (Aye)
Real niggas don’t cry
Look, yo

[Verse 1]
Was just a youngin’ with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything I’m wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw nigga, but shit done changed since Maine was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I’m a man worried about my fam
Let me explain
It’s like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit’s sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
You feeling like the world’s on your back so you stumble
In the field like a quarterback get sacked, then you fumble
Jobs don’t call a nigga back, so it’s back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms, the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost faith
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral (damn)

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
But I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no
(ay, ay, ay, yea)
(listen, yo)

[Verse 2]
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weather’s bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like, “Damn it’s ’06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?” (that shit old, dawg)
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate in like three weeks, some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement, uh (rest in peace)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her, she was standing at the bus stop
Wait, man she was eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
Every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)
They killed her only son
Now she wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man, I can’t watch this shit

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Verse 3]
Take a ride through the city man, tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits
Violence, hatred, real devastation
Neighborhoods looking like there’s still segregation
Welfare, single mothers, no jobs
Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
Fiends in the street so high off of that crack shit
This nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress (bang!)
White folks got the road to success mapped and that’s all good
But why don’t blacks got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
And it seems like I done prayed for a million days
But still the ills remain, just bills and pain
Shootouts in project buildings, children slain
Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can’t though

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Outro]
Yeah, shit dedicated to my cousin Ricky man
Hoop dreams cut short man
Learned he had a baby on the way
Nigga wasn’t even a senior in high school, though
Hold your head man



[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”



[Intro]
Yea Yea, uh
It's Carolina, nigga
Yeah
Ay
Fayettenam
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Listen, alive and still kickin nigga
I survived the ville
But a lot will not, so they wield Glocks and Bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill
Money hungry, tryna find a meal
Can't stay inside and chill
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas
Lying like they on the pill
Preachers say we blessed
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel gates
My mind is still- racing, I'm tryna kill- snakes
Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
Yeah

Yo, Coming home, y'all
Listen
At any given time, got the city on my mind
The city on my mind
The city on my mind
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
At any given time, Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine
I'm tryna go for mine

Hey
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show
Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose
Money goes, the money come
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks
The Carolina way
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say
Cause in Carolina- we thorough
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G-boro
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yea
Yo, coming home nigga!

[Verse 2: Deacon]
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like
Ooh!
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'
Blew game and I do my thing
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring
Oh no!
Riding with my niggas for the weekend
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
Ooh!



Carpe Diem

Interpolates she's mine part 1 by j cole

Intro

I never felt so alive, i never felt so alive
I never felt i’d survive, i never felt i'd survive
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, you shoot
At me
I’m wounded enough, oh my
I beg for mercy
And i didn't even hesitate
I wanna fall
But i always find a way to crawl (back to you)
On any night i lose myself
Find the bookshelf
And the man above

(verse 1)
Up late, writing poems
It's the devil's hour
Got the lamp by my side
This migraine is power
I know what you've done
Tossed me aside like rotten meat
While the hounds feast
Such a wicked feast
You're trapped in my mind
I resort to go ghost
Our relation a constant see saw
I know i'm a handful
All i want is to find trust
Lay low while i'm at
I’d invite you if i was brainless
But i’d never be that
You're consuming me though
But you wouldn’t know
Knowing what I can't have
Burns more than trying blow
It's hard to hold on
But harder to let go
Think i'll just throw in the towel
And suffocate myself with a plastic bag
I hope you’ll stay carefree
Go look for comfort
Whether it's a queen
Or just another damaged madman to destroy
Handle with care

I never felt alive, i never felt alive
I always think i'd die, i always think i'd die
Don't catch me, you
Catch me, you're doomed
Forever

This song is dedicated to many people who have had battles with out of control beings. this, is the ode to the devil



[Intro]
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

[Verse 1]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"
This is chaining day

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear
They even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear

[Verse 3]
Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said this shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
Cause I love this slavery

[Outro]
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I said this is my last time



[verse]
Sick of watching games, im making my claim to fame
Fuck running your plays, im cutting in thru the lane
Before i ever i rapped i copped myself my first chain
I wear this crystal piece around my neck everyday
I stay on my grind until i get my moms a benz and a beamer
New cribs, white carpets, grass greener
Gourmet chef cooking us things we’ve never seen
Pinching myself when my success feel like a dream
These Real eyes realize when im being deceived
Everything gucci long as a nigga makin cream
100 on my lip i got the gift of the gab
Conversations with myself because i needed a laugh
I ain't crazy, im outer space feeling wavy
Could never play me, tryna trap me for a baby
Ain't tryna have a bunch like brady
Maybe one, but i ain't sure if ima live to see 80

[hook]
I need you to know it, know it
Im living life
I need you to know it , know it
[Im living life i swear
Silver chains i hold tight thats my midas feel] x2

[verse]
Committed to addiction im never giving this weed up
Copping up a zip and get twisted im screaming we up
Me & my niggas really living, no competition
We are in tune, better listen, no repetition
Mind a typhoon when my brain doin its thinkin
Gotta stay afloat, so my ship is never sinkin
My intuition is telling me there be better days
Right now im lit cause i just finished rolling purple haze
Lift me up outta the slump & put me through a phase
Help me get into my mind, meditate
Let me elevate, rise up out this hell of hella fakes
Making better cake, and you ain't fucking up my recipe
Women, weed and wealth, need em all to get next to me
Title on my belt, i need everyone to envy me
Fakes never felt a real nigga like this
Chop it wit ya chick, hit the crib & smoke a spliff



[Intro: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight
(Remix, J. Cole, Breezy, yeah)
Some people give their lives, oh

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
Team UK we on a mad ting (Hah!)
American girls they love my accent
Roadman, rate me, affiliated with money
Yardie girls love me, affiliated with Gully (Vado)
Hot topic, I'm the one they wanna talk on
A thin line between love and hate is what I walk on (Uh)
And any song I ever dropped was a right move (Yeah)
From the underground but came from the right too (Hah!)
You tryna blow your way over air (Over air)
I'm puttin' power moves for the year (Haha)
Type of idiot to hate before you hear
But even if you hatin', it's nothin', I got your ears

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion (Yeah, yeah)
But I was born a champion

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Uh, this gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the records, no cameras, forget a quote
Some of my family doin' good, most doin' dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma gettin' beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can't even see down
Award shows, I pour my heart out
And people still steady tryna point my flaws out
And I'd be lyin' if I say it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, yeah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha, uh)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (That's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe, woah, oh
But I was born a champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion (Yeah, yeah)
But I was born a champion

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cole World, young Simba, story of my life
How to shine, put glory over ice
Rules made to be broken like a Oreo in life
Unabomber, they thought I blew up overnight (Boom)
UPS, plus it down, huh, while you BS'd and fucked around
I took a dollar to the city of the dreams
Called up my homies and then I put them on my team
And so we paid, and now we out in London, oh, behave
Cold World if you wonderin', snowy days
I made it through with no heaters, fuck the leaders
When we starvin' they won't feed us, we don't need 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk & Both]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit, making sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Some people wait their turn (Aha)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (Champion, ooh, that's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha, woo!)
Some people give their lives (Aha)
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion (I was, I was, yeah)
Some people have to learn (Ahah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha)

[Outro: Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
Champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion, woah, oh
Champion (Yeah)
But I was born a champion



[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Let me tell you a little story about my homie Corey
Right now he's locked down serving at least forty
But excuse me, I got ahead of myself, I'm sorry son
This story starts in his youth, he was hardly one
When his pops got knocked for coping rocks
From under cover cops on the corner of his block
And he never got a chance to meet him
Cause the very next year his pops is laying still in the prison cell bleeding from stab wounds, fatal
Bad news Corey's mother and older brother already caught in the struggle
Brother barely ate tryna hustle just to carry weight
The whole family underweight cause they rarely ate
One thing my nigga never got was love
And his whole childhood he was watching drug addicts
His brother supplying it, old mother buying it
You expect a scientist to come from this environment
Get real!, this shits hard enough brought up black
But being poor plus your mums on crack
And your brothers a hustler tryna take you under his wing shit, just a fucking wonder his breathing

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Age five, Corey had dreams to be a cop, but
Age six, his older brother passed the Glock, let him hold it
Plans change, he started his campaign
Age thirteen, little boy doing big man things
And that's what he thought
He was jacking rims from mustangs
Beating down on his class mates for chump change
Running round with the tough gang
The older niggas he sold dope for 'em, they bought clothes for him
However, soon he got older and selling petty dimes turned into some pretty heavy crimes
The shit got to the point where he was stealing rides from his block
Even robbing quick stops
Ladies loved him, he was crazy fucking
Knocking boos daily, pretty soon he had a baby coming
But he didn't claim it, his baby mother was crazy loving him
She said "Baby, let's settle down," he left her hanging
He'd rather be on the streets slanging a wild cat
But god damn i seen it coming a mile back
A drug deal gone bad guns bursting
Now Corey lying in a cell cause he merked him
Whats the moral of the story?, figure it out
So the next time you ask why niggas are wild
You know with out a doubt, don't try and deny the shit
Young black male, a product of his environment

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cause i can't stand to see my people struggling
But what we up against? tough conditions in this life
And they wonder why these niggas all get hype, get high and fist fight
Or why they live like they living, to get ice and cars
No type of jobs, income coming from dicing and robbing niggas in broad daylight
Its hard cause all they know in this life is scars
This mic is all i need to change the globe, re-arrange it and make it so
Niggas ain't in pain no more
Cause they they don't pay no more mind to all youth
Till they got to locking them up and dawg that's the truth yo
Thats the truth yo, that's the truth



[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, school girl, cool girl
You dressing sexy and your mama is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folks thang
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool, girl
You got your new hair, it look so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him 'round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it?
It's cause your mind don't match what your ass got
But cheer up, you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're lookin' for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter, you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking...

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the Glock to my head, feel I rather be dead
Hey, am I hopeless? Raised with rats and roaches
Never liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask "what's the matter?" but you can't relate
Living the life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I’m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother, yeah I love her
But things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer
Darkened my heart and I don't know if I’ll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She said she proud of me and I wonder what for?
And once more

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey

Trae tha Truth
Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Wonder what it's like, how a nigga kill a nigga on sight
Did he hesitate? Think about his life, think about his kids, think about his wife?
But that nigga heartless, group homes, nigga never had no fosters
Cause who taking home the little black kid, poor thing, his momma is a crackhead
So the state raised him, and the hate raised him
They clowned on him at school but he fronted like it ain't phased him
Shit, now it's about getting money cause these cool niggas think his shit is funny
Gotta have clothes, gotta have dough, hoes ain't checking unless you got plenty, now a nigga selling dope
Holding onto a little hope of a better life, huh, but that hope fades so quick
Cause he getting paid so quick
He be robbing niggas just to cop the shit the minimum wage won't get
Young niggas trapped, young niggas strapped, heart turned black, won't turn back

[Hook: Ink]
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Later days, dealing with mistakes
On this corner tryna catch another break
Fuck school, tell them he was coming late
Block dry, hear they praying something shake
Now everybody taking off his plate
Bill him what, half of that he have it late
His best friend by the yellow crates
Suicide, tears tryna hesitate
Only seventeen, damn, seventeen
Nightmares, opposite of heaven’s dream
Bout to thaw, he ain’t got the weather lean
Black mans, cooking more than he’s ever seen
White books, he ain’t talking education
Fuck what he facing, the stripes are registration
Losing his mind, won’t lose his reputation
Try him he busting without no hesitation
Damn, young nigga attitude, like fuck it
Still tryna make it out the bucket
Light feather all time low still
Tryna figure out how the fuck he finna duck it
He gotta ride it out before he crash
He on his hustle tryna get the cash
Can’t focus, shit’s spinning fast
Laws on him, hope he’s got his work stashed
Loud work, hope it don’t smell
Can’t afford to take another L
First class, no feeling
Fuck school he about to fail
It’s all him, he ain’t finna tell
He on his own, he ain’t finna bail
Either way, he on his way to jail
Shoulda chilled now he headed for a cell

[Hook: Ink]
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men

[Verse 3: Trae tha Truth]
Look, now we in the prison cell
No commissary, no mail
No phone calls, just time
Couple of years He gon’ pay it, no mind
On his way to parole hope it get it
Middle finger to the warden hope he get it
Niggas wanna take it there they know he make it
Fresh shakes take him to the mic he hit it
They gon’ catch bitch he on his way
Try to stop him and it’s gonna be on today
Solitary confinement every day
“Fuck ‘em all” only thing he know to say
Now it’s time up, he a free man
Gates open, thinking of another plan
Where he finna go, what he finna do
Finna be a couple those, he coming through
Then it’s back to the hood “S” on his chest
Fuck Super, that nigga stressed
He going through hell like he never blessed
Every day in pain, nothing less
Pills in, zoned out, right plan, wrong route
Opportunity present itself in the kitchen
Guarantee he shows what he’s ‘bout
Under pressure no slack
Fuck jail he ain’t going back
Only way you leaving is a box
And you can tell everyone that’s a fact
Had my back, on his pistol
Black clouds, black rain
To his head, where he aim
Feel the same now the bullet in his brain

[Hook: Ink]
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men

Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds
My main chick she got real hair, never had to shop to get hers
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat, but goddamn she rocking them furs
Ball so hard mothafucka wanna fine me, and now the hoe wanna climb me
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching 'oops nigga
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no budget
Go! Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ayy
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?
Next time I'ma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon' shock her
"You're so tall, what team do you play for?" No bitch, I'm a doctor
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah
Float like a propeller, no helicopter shit
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber
Nigga say they pop cause they dont fill they collars up
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up
Bitch nigga...

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (2 Chainz)
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start off with these four bars
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar
I'm rockin' gold bars, whoop your ass with this crowbar
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin' re-coupe
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin' on gas, full service
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Outro: J Cole]
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow
Please don't tell my momma I spent my tuition on these bottles
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'



[Intro]
Poverty's paradise
If you want it, you'd better think twice

[Hook: Canei Finch]
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, but how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
In a nigga, yeah, no love in a nigga
If I could paint a picture, I'd show a image
Of a dog ass nigga, yeah, a raw ass nigga
Popping pain killers, riding for the cause
Four dogs with them pistols, na-na-natural born killers
He sold crack to his mother, turned his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug, he think everything a hustle
Co-cold muh'fucka, holmes numb
Black heart, no feelings, just a gun, fo'real
He was raised in the trenches
Not to mention, all the hoes they had dissed him
So holmes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him, grandpa, Klan lynched him
He was raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kinda hard to adapt
So holmes turned to a strap
Didn't succeed, tried rap, couldn't fight, got slapped
Shot dice, do crap, did time, back out, damn

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, no love, no love
How you gon' survive now? No love, no love
Yo Gotti, lemme paint a picture for these niggas, hey, huh
Here’s a, voice for the voiceless
My words like, multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like, a searchlight in the darkness for this young black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces or they corpses now
In God we trust, but it’s bucks that we worship now
Boy, that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
See I seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit, he said, “Let's go and do the sequel”
But his, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it now
Feeling guilty, what would momma think about me?
Told 'em, "Think about it, nigga, won't you think about it now?"
But he was money hungry, plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy, burners packed just like a stadium
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he ain’t commit, tears soak the handkerchief

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Fo'real, fo'real
Lights off, no candles, roaches all around the kitchen
Nigga hungry, mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it
Grandma wanna help but momma ego kicking in
She a hustler, she don’t need no help raising her kids
Bills came, got evicted, stayed strong
Square business, she ain’t never showed weakness, real shit
That created the hunger, and that make the monsters
Got the game from our momma, that’s some ill shit
Thirteen on the block, he was a lookout
In the kitchen, on the stove like it’s a cookout
Young nigga mastered the game, could put a book out
Right when he thought it was over, he got took out (bang!)
Brains leaking, nigga sneaked him, he ain't even seen it coming
He a hitta, he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
No revenge, with his friends shooting dice, bet again
Win or lose, take it all, took out by his own men

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Outro: J. Cole]
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday
Oh, we can fly someday
Yeah, up in the sky someday, mm
Do real niggas get to Heaven? That’s that shit I ask the reverend
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday (fly)
Oh, we can fly someday (fly)
Yeah, up in the sky someday (sky)
Do real niggas get to Heaven? That’s that shit I ask the reverend



“Cold Breakfast”

[Intro] speech from creed.....

[Verse 1]
I just swiped my badge for a shift
My boss been bitchin at me
Blood sweat & tears on this job never been happy
Wanna walk up out this bitch I ain't going back to the streets
They got control over a nigga like I had too much to drink
I got shackles round my ankles got me dragging my feet
I’m just a slave thats getting paid this ain't part of the dream
I Enrolled up into college tried helping myself
Them student loans a do you in designed to place u in debt
Just got me in a bigger hole, that just gave me better flows
Inspiration got inspired its more like getting tired
Fuck it
Thats just my attitude but I ain't tripping
They all pray for me to fail increasing my ambition
I want it like never before, like I’m serving 25
A coincidence, the age my teacher told me I'd die
Take a breath of this life, they glorifying the trap
We use to hustle for dollars but now they hustle for scraps
Niggas just wanna be seen
My clothes better than yours
Buying 400 dollar jeans but yo family is poor?
Being Foolish…
A lot of people clueless
But I ain't mad at cha, just mistakes we all human
Cold Breakfast!
In the middle of the night you unemployed
In a chevy tinted up while u just riding with cha boyz
Now the cops behind ya feeling nervous, got u swerving
Throw the dope up out the window in pursuit in that suburban

[Chorus]
Cold Breakfast.......
My Nigga Cold Breakfast
Cold Breakfast


[Verse 2]
I ain't had a haircut in some weeks, I’m just busy makin music
Giv ah fuck bout appearance Im a full blooded mutant
This the power of seduction M.Bison I psycho crush ya
Arms folded with a suit, call me gentleman ruffin
And I’m shining like a light, critics say I’m spitting nice
I ain't rapping metaphoric
I just call this spitting life
I put a spin on it, bout to make a mill off it
Long walks a problem child just in that principals office
Fast forward I’m making bids at the table with bosses
Give it time and let me settle
Competition for that medal
Like I’m in the rap olympics in a ring they wanna wrestle
Lifting weights stay with that choppa cuz niggas will try and test you
Any given moment, treat the lyrics like a sport
Game 6 either way
Jus live to see a better day
Told my daughter ima make it, better place for her to stay
Better schools, more toys, bigger space for her to play
Cold Breakfast…

[Chorus]
Cold Breakfast.......
My Nigga Cold Breakfast
Cold Breakfast

Yeah.....



[Intro]
This right here is not a preview
I need to let it go, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he's throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying: "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...

[Verse 2]
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them 90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
Cause I'm finta, drop knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dumbies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets, but nigga that ain't really where they were
Acting just like there they were, but who am I to judge?
That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If i had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera, at the same time
And put name tags on they titties so I don’t get they name wrong
Screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from sampling now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas, 
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer
But the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...

[Outro]
June 25th. Born Sinner. Bitch



[Intro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like...)
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha, bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "When?", Bitch! When I feel like it

[Hook]
Cole World (World), Cole Life (Life), Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

[Verse 2]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me (Woohoo!)
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me (Woohoo!)
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story (Woohoo!)
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

Hm, Ok, we're outta here (O-o-o-key-key-key)
I think it's safe to say we outta here
(We outta here, we outta here, we-we-we)
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here

[Outro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night (Night, night, night)
A hell of a night (Night, night, night)
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like)
Hey (Hey, hey, hey...)

[Verse 1]
It's hard to picture a nigga not getting money
J. Cole living bummy? Hahaha that shit is funny
I’m focused on that cash, I just laugh at them bastards
Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor’s
And if this rap shit don’t work, I’m going for my Master’s
Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades
A nigga straight A’s like the Braves
She got me in her dorm room, talking bout her room ain’t clean
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leaves
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seeing
Cuz if the girl get excited, she’s invited. (haha)

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh, I hate to brag, well naw, I don’t, the big man on campus
I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga glances
And if your ass is dumb you won’t even get a chance
Cuz I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga answers, yea
And if I hit ya shorty, keep it on the low
This shit just like highschool, people wanna know
I see you haters mad, but I ain’t mad at y’all niggas
We get ass like them basketball niggas, I’m ballin’
Got a sidekick so them hoes don’t be callin’!
Hit me on aim, ay what’s your screen name?
When I start typing in, a nigga’s got some mean game, yea
And when I whip it out, shit she gonna think she seeing things, but
Back in Carolina I miss home badly, (yea)
It’s funny hoes I couldn’t have is tryna bag me
But I’m in the Jeep with this freaky ass Aggy
She said she want it from the back, gladly

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 3]
I’m skipping class just to get some ass, living fast
And college with no sleep nigga, my jabs quick as Zab's
So kill that old college gangsta shit we dont believe
You mad cuz your girl on Facebook poking me, so uh
You know the G, I hit her up like “Hello Elle
I see you looking right the other day, LOL
So, what’s good with you?”
She hit me right back like “Shit, what’s good with you?”
You know I like that, so of course I write back
Hit her with some nice chat
Same night she in my room, lights off I strike that
Yea I put game right, but that’s your wife, nigga take her
I bust then I kick her ass out to write a paper, yea (hahaha)
A nigga doing homework, drinking like a fish
It ain’t a weekend that I’m sober
Fighting hangovers on my way to my internship
And I forgot to study for my midterm, shit!

[Outro]
Hahahaha, wooo!
Ay, this is straight through, nigga
No, no fucking, no double takes
This is straight through the whole shit nigga
Check it out man, tryna tell y’all niggas man
College is a good look
A real good look, my nigga
For more reasons than one, man

That shit like extra expensive
I got scholarships though, so you know I’m not sweating that
I feel for my niggas that couldn’t make it man
Ay Mike we in there baby, hahaah

Fayettenam, yeah, yeah
Class of 2007 man
Holla at me
I’m going to grad school though, you know?



[Intro: Miguel & J. Cole]
Trust
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I don't wanna put no pressure on ya
I just wanna put a blessing on ya
Since our last undressin' session
I'm not really sure if you've been checkin'
I'm progressin', I just heard my songs
Is poppin' out in Macedonia
And even Serbia, I don't mean to burden ya
If you got a man since then, I understand
Last thing I wanna do is get you jammed
'Specially if he's a fan
He'll prolly never wanna hear my shit again
And I need every single SoundScan
But if you single and you down, then...
I'm in your town fiendin' for another round
I was countin' down the days
Been more patient than a Browns fan
Where that chip at?
Prolly on your shoulder, 'cause I forgot to hit back
Left you on read, apologies are said
But often never meant, well fuck that, I repent
For message never sent, now...

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hello, stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
And by the way, just got in town
And I won't let cumulus clouds all in the sky ruin my vibe
Usually, I don't do this often
But since recruiting isn't an option
Due to unusual rain and thunder
Baby, I wonder, baby, I wonder, would you just

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Put your sweats on, put your sweats on for me, yeah
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't hesitate, no, don't you, no, no

[Chorus: Miguel]
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Mmm say it

[Post-Chorus: Miguel]
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night

[Verse 3: Miguel]
Hello, stranger, vape's been waiting
And just as I recall, that ass is still amazing
I'm playin', baby; nah I'm sayin', baby
Lovin' shit, you know I'm crazy
So go ahead and pour the drink up
I'm so glad we got to link up, uh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Get to takin' that off, takin' that off for me, yeah yeah
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't make me wait, no, don't you, no, no

[Chorus: Miguel & J. Cole]
Just say you will, will, will  yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
She hit back, shit that's a good sign... yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Ayy, Gucc, can I tell her some real shit? Yeah

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
In case my lack of reply had you catchin' them feelings
Know you've been on my mind like Kaepernick kneelin'
Or police killings, or Trump sayin' slick shit
Manipulatin' poor white folks because they ignant
Blind to the struggles of the ones that got the pigment
Lately I've been stressin' 'cause it seems so malignant
I need to feel your essence in my presence if you're with it
I guarantee you won't regret you did it if you come through

[Chorus: Miguel]
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Come through and chill, chill, chill
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night
Just say you will, will, will
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Mmm say it

[Post-Chorus: Miguel]
I wanna f... all night (uh say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night

[Outro: J. Cole & Miguel]
(Ahh)
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
(Ahh)
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, (Mmm say it) yeah
(Ahh)



[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Back where I belong
I’ve never felt so strong eh
Feeling like there’s nothing that I can’t try
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is my story this is my song
If you ain't got the heart, don’t attempt to try this at home
It’s just a poem from a man once living wrong
Now I’m in the zone, tell the World I’m coming home
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
Who’d have thought we’d be running rap when we was knee high
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
Or cause I’m famous you don’t gotta know what pain is
But I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind
But one thing I never lose is my grind
My closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can’t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
And then help me get my genius out
And get back to what I had
If my good’s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it’s on my diary, I’m living for my kids
Now they is just as fly as me
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming



[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Intro: Diddy]
I'm back where I belong (yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you

[Verse 1: Diddy]
I hear the "Tears of a Clown," uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Diddy]
“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Verse 3]
“Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (here I stand), a better man
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all!

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming



(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming

(Verse 1: DeStorm Power)
I said i'm back up in this place
And i'm finally at the front of this race
And i ain't going back
I'ma rip this track so the world should remember my face
I said i'm back up in this place
And i'm finally at the front of this race
And i ain't going back
I'ma rip this track so the world should remember my face

I've been away for awhile
I gave my word when i returned
And i come back with a smile
And i don't come back at all
The world is throwing blows
But i ain't backing off
Everybody claiming they want to grow
But they just slacking off
It took a lot of years to put the hood behind me
The best advice i got was that i had to find me
Another day, another challenge
I never thought i'd see the day i'd be rewarded for my talents

(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming home

(Verse 2: DeStorm Power)
And if you ever call up
And say you fell down
It feels good that i can finally help them all up
I'm doing well now
Let's go to the mall now
We ain't gotta split the bill
I told you i got all us
Came a long way from those ghettos on the east coast
The 7th letter, 6 number, flying high who needs coach
I miss my son up in my arms, miss my homies, miss my mom's
So home cooking with the bomb

(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming home

(Verse 3: DeStorm Power)
This once's for all my people in the struggle
Unemployed or working double shifts
Take your head and lift it in the air
One fist in the air
Reach for the stars, you're almost there
You can't make it, i've been there
You can't take it, i've been there
Given that all the hope is gone
Find something to focus on
You need motivation
That's the reason why we play this song
To let you know you're not out in this world on your own
And the only time you're going back
Is when you're going home

(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming home



[Verse 1]
And the blood will dry, underneath my nails
And the wind will rise up, to fill my sails

[Pre-Chorus]
See you can doubt, and you can hate
But I know, no matter what it takes

[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Verse 2]
Still far away, from where I belong
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Pre-Chorus]
See you can doubt, and you can hate
But I know, no matter what it takes

[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that’s flattering but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y’all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, ask me if I gained weight, I said nah
My pockets got fatter, that’s all
Money was an issue but now that that’s solved, I ball, I ball
Like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantel
Dawg my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me
How that feel? Very happy (very happy)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Cole World, Boy, check the degree’s
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze
That’s why I blew up on you sucka’s all thats left is debris
One soldier’s all that’s left is fatigues
Act like you know me boy, I’m Kobe
How the fuck you gon step in my league
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling?
‘Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen
I’m ’bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin’
Killin’ niggas like K K K violence
I guess it’s why they pay homage
Momma I’mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..
Whatever man

[Beat Change]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin’
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin’
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin’
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown huntin’
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin’ like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peatin’
And I’m knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin’
The label heat seekin’, nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin’
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

[Break]
I’m heavy
I’m heavy
Man these niggas get exlusives
Hey, hey

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Man, I’m already hot, you can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your’s “be seated”
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin’ out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinkin’ I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fuckin’ bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just happy he made it
My money was running late now, now it’s happy belated
I’m heavy, nigga I’m heavy



[Intro (Sampled): Billie Holiday (J. Cole)]
What can I do?
It’s cost me a lot
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
(Shit homie) It’s cost me a lot (Shit homie)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y’all can see I’m ballin’, HD

[Refrain]
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that

[Verse 2]
Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word

[Refrain]



[Verse 1: Bas]
They putting prices on heads, silver or lead
I pray the scores settle 'fore the devil notice you dead
Got me smoking the potent, my eyes open and Otis, they red
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said
That aunty sippin on, we missin ya
Even tho you gone, your thought alone can lift us up
This is us
Got some niggas never call me 'less they need something
But I pick up, like, "whassup, what you need cousin?"
My niggas know that I love 'em
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow
Used to borrow your digital scale
Flippin' them sales
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger
The swishers and dutch fill up
Bitches in lust with us
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing
Had a talk and she remark: "you so engaging"
Running game, it's all the same
I'm growing jaded
Had a couple things in common, like Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too faded for conversatin'
I'm sittin' here contemplatin' how to win

[Chorus: J Cole]
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Yeah
Cousin in jail again, asking me for bail again
Close when I was 12, but I was much frailer then
He was like 16, a nigga from the gutter and
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now you buggin'
Cause you looking at the cover and you say "Yo that's my cousin"
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden
And I'm showing love saying "yo look what I did
Man, nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big"
But now you saying "Man enough about you
Shit what about me, my nigga what about me?
Oh you forgot about me?"
Same niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cuz got yo back
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up
See you headed to the top you need to let me catch up
Please let me catch up
Won't you let me catch up man"
"I'll see you when I see you
Harsh as it seems to say, I wouldn't want to be you
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you"

[Chorus: J Cole]
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Life is beautiful, man
Life is so fucking beautiful
This beat is beautiful
It's the perfect way to end like whatever the fuck it is that I started
The rest of my life starts, right now
And it's that feel good music for the soul, naw'm saying
And it goes like...

[Verse 1]
Ay yo I'm rolling up a spliff, bouta be high as a cliff
With the style that they bit
They need a fucking forklift to, raise they bars up
I leave 'em all starstruck
Arms tucked under this blunt we bouta spark up
Mind elevated, sit down and write raps
Smoking outta a white cap, where the fuck the mic at?
We complicated peeps, need to make up for the sleep that we lose when we choose to write our words on this sheet
Someone asked me what I'm up to and it sucked to say "not much, dude"
Stay at home and read lyrics off pages that I run through
The simple words of a simple complicated man
With a gram and a mic in his hand, sipping out of a tall can of that ratchet juice
And I had a suit from my Secret Agent Z attribute
Had to shoot every motherfucker that I disagree with
Got much love for the cats I smoke tree with

[Verse 2]
I'm making moves and I'm lit like a stick
While I hotbox the world with Anna Kendrick
I got a fifty fifty chance I'll advance
Your girl's in a trance
She wanna dance on my pants
But the truth is, I'm not that type of guy, that's not a lie
I'd rather find a girl with pretty eyes that I can spend the rest of my life with
Flipping off the light switch, getting into that night shit
I like this, goddamn, this is what life is
Goddamn, this is what life is
(This is life right here)

[Verse 3]
Ladies and gentleman, let me show you my brethren
Believe he gets the letters and just trying to find a better him
Let him make it evident, pass the mic and let him speak
His name is HideandSeekZoo and he'll be here all week

Ay yo my wisdom is infinite and my nonsense is crafty
Not much of a rapper I just talk over rap beats
You'll never catch me asking all the cats walking past me, "You know HideandSeekZoo? Well, he raps and that's me."
And lately I've been thinking, and you think I'd have enough of it
It's really all I know and plus, I'm used to loving it
Rather spark a blunt than spark up a conversation
Always thinking to myself, a back and forth interrogation
Like, 'Where the hell you headed, what the fuck you wanna do?'
I wanna smoke a blunt or two, sip a brew, chill with the C.L.S crew until I die or find something to do with life
And I'm turning my wrong into rights, still confessing into this mic
And I think I found a girl that can change me and make me happy
Cos I tend to push love away before it starts happening
But fuck it, that's life and fuck it, it's alright
I just want to find a girl that I can speak to every night
Cos damn, yo I'm lonely and I only got the homies
Roll a blunt and let it burn slowly
The one and only coming, with a style that is so worth the while
See me hungover on God's bathroom tile

[Verse 4]
This is for everyone who didn't think that I could do this
You're living life useless
Please get a clue, bitch
Still thinking, blindsided by the thought of it
The perfect life is a bandwagon, hop off of it
The sooner it comes, the sooner it goes
And I stay writing flows cos it's all that I know
Fluent with the pen, I smile as I write this
I like this, goddamn, this is what life is
Goddamn, this is what life is
Goddamn, this is what life is
This is what life is
This is what life is
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Ad-Libs: Choir]

[Outro: Choir]
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Round

[Verse 1]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus]
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Verse 2]
Listen
I got a story for ya, when I was seventeen
I had a name, was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nuttin' new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin'
Going nowhere, I figured, "Fuck it, there's a couple hoes here"
I might as well sign up and climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse, spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage, I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like I dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga, DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat fast, the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak, that is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger that killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again, I begged my mom for braces, then I had a

[Chorus]
Crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile

[Verse 3]
Growing up was just a young knucklehead running wild
Momma youngest, e'erybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile, snaggletooth nigga for a while
Liftin' up my pillow, tooth fairy never came around
Damn, we was po', but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily, look and wonder how my teeth'll grow
They came slow and out of line, I couldn't comprehend
The significance at the time, this crooked smile
Was just another sign saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah, remember Brandy? Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga, Sosa, I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear, J's drop
He got a fresh new pair, and there I was with hand-me-downs
Turn into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention

[Chorus]
With this crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Outro]
"Crooked Smile". You know what it is. This is for those that's—that's not picture perfect, but we still worth the picture, you know? As I sit here and sip this Corona. Ayy, shout out to Brandy, man. I—I still got love for ya. I'll never forget, we was in the fifth grade, maybe it was later than that, but remember we was at the [?] we had the orchestra thing and you told—you told a white girl, you told her to tell me that if I went and got some braces that you would go out with a nigga [?] shit. Ah, those were the days. I still got love for ya. You know shit like that made a nigga tough



[Intro: J. Cole]
Tick
This is for my niggas in the fourth quarter
Just watching that clock tick. Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You said, "at what point do you start seeing bread?
Been out hustling for years, shoe box right under my bed
I move the work out my momma’s house, got me a little old crib
I always fantasize if I had went to college instead
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek I’m better off dead
Fucking with this white, it’s all been downhill like a sled
Now listen, I understand they say you make your own bed
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread
In denial about the feds, he can’t see past bread
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?
These are the times, survival my only crime
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone
Inside of me Lord I know, it’s a lie that we gon' be fine
But momma I’m tired of crying, just lie to me one more time"

[Hook]
Cause it’s crunch time
Cause it’s crunch time
Shit real man
A nigga got bills man it’s crunch time

Shit real man a nigga got bills

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Look, scavenge these records of these days MP3’s
Looking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV’s
This is for nigga’s with empty dreams and empty jeans
Still holding on to the word maybe
Cause this 9 to 5 shit is driving you stir crazy
Coming home tired just to hear it from your lady
Hollering about your baby, need this and need that
And all you want is peace and quiet
Maybe some feedback, on these raps
Cause labels ain’t hollering, and niggas ain't downloading
Nobody see your vision, they walking around blindfolded
All this time holding on to possibilities
You step outside, you smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze
Fuck what they talking, it ain’t like life come often
Only thing worse than death is a regret filled coffin
So try before you die or always wonder what if?
I thank the lord for this wonderful gift
Looking for strength in this crunch time

[Hook]
Looking for strength in the crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg
It’s crunch time, yeah nigga it’s crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg

[Outro: J. Cole]
I feel your pain nigga trust me
For all my nigga’s out there still trying to get it
Few nigga’s I know, few nigga’s I don’t know

Shout out to my nigga FilthE
Nervous Reck
Shout out to Marcus
My nigga I forgive you for all that shit you said
I understand my nigga
Still love. Yeah



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck ya girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy, what you think?", "Little girl, you're growin' up
Growin up"

[Chorus]
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?" "little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Can I get a witness, this is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey, Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up, growin' up"

[Chorus]
Hey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up"
Hey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl



[Intro]
Let me try this
Uh, Yeah
Money coming soon
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
Omen what up nigga?
Yea niggaaaa, yea, uh

[Verse 1]
Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?(true)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that! (haha)
Like fuck it I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks spend dough on mad shit for stuntin,'(yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid. (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things, (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin'
But them whites ain't. (hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation,"(yea)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating,)
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em. (yea)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention, (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition, (ahaha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition, (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't into doing, they into wishin,'

Yeah
Uh
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln



[Intro]
Yeah, Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
These niggas is playing
Russian Roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless, no, we don't dance
All we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2]
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be LeBron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it

[Pre-Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled)  & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Intro]
Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Bridge]
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising

[Outro]
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her



[Intro]
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want her, nigga
And put a ring on her finger if you love her, nigga
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want her, nigga
And put a ring on her finger if you love her, nigga
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want her, nigga
And put a ring on her finger if you love her, nigga
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want her, nigga
And put a ring on her finger if you love her, nigga...

[Verse 1]
I used to walk around with my head down
Kept it up ever since you came around
You turn my frowns to smiles
And my smiles to frowns
But at the end, baby you always stay down
I know, I ain't the only nigga who's after you
I know there's a lot of niggas who's tryna get close to you
To be honest, I'm surprise that you pick me, out of all niggas who wanted you
That's something a pretty girl won't do
I mean, a pretty girl like you, supposed to have the freshest  nigga in the school
But I can't judge a book by it's cover
By the way, that nigga was a fool
Cause clearly you lookin' for a nigga who got dreams, that he ain't afraid to pursue
I barley know you and already I'm going crazy for you
Honestly, I just wanna pull you to the side and say:
Hey!, let me impress you
But not in a dirty way, more like in a flirty way
Let me be the reason why you stutter on every word you say
Brag about me to your friends almost every fuckin day
Oh! And don't forget to mention that I'm your fuckin "Bae", Okay?

[Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Verse 2]
Okay look
I'm staring at you across the room
I wonder, can you see yourself as the bride and me the groom
Like, do you want a small wedding? or big wedding?
Yeah, I know I'm a rapper baby but I'm always gonna stay the same no matter where I'm heading
The way you carry yourself tells me that your pussy taste just like heaven
Been thinkin' sexual ever since I was seven to eleven
Damn, now I wanna slurp my girl up from seven to eleven
Let me stop before I set the mood
After we fuck, we always go and get some food, that's our daily routine
Eat a nice meal, after I just made that pussy cream
Fuck!, another one of my daydreams
But who said I can't make her actually scream?...

[Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

Diamonds

[Intro: J. Cole]
It's a real nigga revolution, real nigga revolution
It should not be televised

[Chorus]
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now on some sweet shit I want my kisses when I want them
On some freak shit I want my dick sucked when I want it
On some G Shit I got my chips up now I’m balling
On some Keith Sweat, I sang them bitches get to falling, on some Ville shit
Made to ball like a goalie net
On some real shit ain't set the time on my Rollie yet - foolish nigga
Always been the coolest nigga, way before you knew this nigga
I went to school with niggas, snatched they bitch then tutor niggas
My hoes smoke, I watch them, don’t roll the blunts I just cop them
Feed her shots of the vodka, she open up like a locker
She a bougie chick, seen every flick at the Oscars
She say I'm just like Sinatra, her pops is into the opera
Well look here my dear I’m the Pavarotti of rhymers
In a brand new Maserati how paparazzi gon’ find us
With my windows tinted like a limo, this is where I write my demo
Duckin' the devil you could say I live my life in limbo

[Bridge: French Montana]
Now let me see them fuckin diamonds, neck full of diamonds, bracelet full of diamonds
Watch full of diamonds, rings full of diamonds
You know I be shinin, drippin in diamonds
Bitches love them diamonds, now throw up all ya motherfuckin diamonds

[Chorus]
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Rose from the bottom, I brush dust the dirt off my shoulders
Pinky ring got a boulder, that bitch cost 10 Corollas
Get so swizz on the beats - I’m so swift with a freak
Know I’m draped like a king, strapped with Iron Sheik
Call my chick Cleopatra, she got rings on her toes
Kings living forever I die embalm me in gold
All the bad bitches mourn, somebody sing me a song
Let the kids touch my casket make sure my neck full of stones
Put my face on that cheddar, got big stones in my bezel
Friends come and they go but a diamond forever
Make sure this car ride slow, Rozay, J.Cole
Got 3 mill on my neck, red suede Kangol

[Bridge: French Montana]
Now let me see them fuckin diamonds, neck full of diamonds, bracelet full of diamonds
Watch full of diamonds, rings full of diamonds
You know I be shinin, drippin in diamonds
Bitches love them diamonds, now throw up all ya motherfuckin diamonds

[Chorus]
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Neck full of diamonds, wrist worth an island
40 niggas strapped up - Yeah 49ers
40/40 bank 40 commas
Give them 40 cash and 40 on consignment, (haaanhh)
Diamonds we got mills on, connected like a jail phone
Shorty want to ride it on top with her heels on
Playin with them falcons like I’m from Decatur
Different zip code every if you talk about my neighbor nigga!
You know we play with different paper nigga
Staples Center, get your head full of staples nigga
I’m talking Paul Pierce with the handle nigga
And all my diamonds clear like a sample nigga

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 1]
Hey, oh no, not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick?
If so, I take her on a voyage
I like 'em long-legged, mega thick
Work it out, you know, employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit?
Cause I keep clogging up the toilet
Coley Cole, fresh as a 4-week old
Not a scratch on me, hoes ask for me
Niggas ask about me, silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the real, this nigga give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label give you the deal
You remind them of me, let's see, how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will?
Ill

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 2]
Enough of that bullshit cake rap
With your childlike scriptures
I'm busting off, nigga, take that
Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood say "We fucking with you Cole, see?
And we're gonna ride right with ya
Yeah, we know you got college degrees
But we got priors like Richard"
And here we are, raps just like CPR
Nigga turn on your TV, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like E.T., completely we be from Mars
Damn he got bars, as if he's speaking of CB4
Need a barrage of freaky broads to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minajs, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods, and yes
Her ass clap and so that's a round of applause, I guess

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Fast lane, looking bad thang with them brains
From the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I’m high as God
Why is it Lord that I can’t seem to slow the whip down?
The same boy standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don’t follow rules
Carter blues, nigga hold up, y’all still don’t got a clue
Yeah, all the cool niggas from high school that still ain’t doing shit
‘Member when y’all used to fuck niggas till they blue and shit?
Now your ass broke as a joke and them niggas doing it
Funny how the tables turned and life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy ‘less he need a dollar from his baby mama
And y’all still don’t wear a condom, is you stupid nigga?
Falling in love with these hoes, is you Cupid nigga?
You better learn ‘fore you burn boy, see me stay on top of my game, David Stern boy
Did this dirt like worms, now my mom was more concerned with the future
Y’all niggas stuck in neutral, this a city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya, I’m here to get ya higher baby so this here the booster
I’m tryna be the king, this that Martin Luther
Shit is crucial, now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ‘Ville, still pourin' liquor ‘fore my niggas killed

[Verse 2: XV]
Look, it’s too bad that he’s too good
Never giving up but it’s sad that you would
My crew like a couple of clansmen, too hood
And when it came to putting on Kansas, who would?
Vizzy, no trying, couple figures on and I’m sitting on Bryants
Game started buzzing so I’m sitting on hydrants
Nah Joe, I’m highjack, you can call me a Somali pirate
All black wallet, inside Irish, mean it’s all green
Yeah, I’m mean with this fly shit, they buzzing like bees in a high nest
Girls getting on they knees for your highness
And I’m running these streets, no bright vest
Stick to the paper, damn, I’m a fly catch
I’m tryna live more, die less and if you tryna get yours, holla X, XV
You should OD off of this rhyme ‘cause I’mma change minds like cold feet
In store for a meal, groceries but they be like “We don’t normally come out at night mostly”
Go and get your rosaries ‘cause I’m about kill this, no halo like Sony
And if your girl a little horse like a pony, ahem, well of course, start pointing
Fly Boy Club, well of course I’m soaring, always gonna
Always be in the air like Jordan
And they always gonna stare, just ignore ‘em
Now you with the X man, I’mma call you Storm
I’m touring her, under that hood and um it’s foreign up under that hood and um
I feel like a dude this cool should feel so I guess I feel good and um XV, J.Cole, we in

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Busting, I'm going off, sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me, these hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club, you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God but to me, she found Satan
She only getting hotter, what's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said “That's cool nigga but can you buy the Benz?”
She playing niggas like a violin, I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day’s found, this is my playground

[Verse 4: XV]
Look, I’mma spit it from the top of the dome, don’t normally do this
But I’m feeling real cool, I am ruthless, like Eazy-E was, I am toothless
Like that one fiend was, I am killing shit like I never do this
I never do this but I’m gonna spit it straight from the top oh
And I know niggas done heard about Kansas but I’m about to do this motherfucker
I done ran shit since ‘02 and I was like oh and y’all niggas don’t know
I’m about to prove man what everything that I’m doing is about to do a movement
X to the V, who you booing? Look, I don’t even do this normally but I’mma do this
Accordingly, cordially, I am dope, yes dude
I have never wrote this shit down in my head
I have spoke shit you that never ever said
‘Cause I’m dope, y’all niggas dead, fresh, chill nigga, I am gonna get this
X to the V, y’all niggas witness, I’m about to throw ‘em back, ruler this
Y’all niggas doing this, y’all niggas know that I’m moving shit
And if you don’t know it right now, google it, I’m about to be on every blog
Doing shit, I’m about to do this shit like E told me do, look, look, I don’t know

[Verse 5: J.Cole]
What do I gotta do to prove to you I’m not the dude for you to just try to fool with?
Niggas ain’t got a clue bitch, niggas wanna bullshit
Don’t know that my crew thicker than these cute bitches, we normally knocking boots with
Too slick to grip, my nigga should stop that
That verse was so old that I done forgot that
But now I come off the top with the hot raps
Niggas know you better stop that
Coming through, got the Glock cocked back
Nigga I ain’t even got one
Nigga, I’m aiming at your face with the shotgun
Lyrically, spiritually
Niggas tryna mirror me but I’m vampire and I’m so damn higher than the average nigga
Can you get witcha ya? I just signed with Jigga, nigga how high you figure?
Damn, I’m slipping up on my words but my verbs so sick that I never slip
Niggas know uh-uh, please save me XV

[Verse 6: XV]
They be like Vizzy on some other shit, on his MCDs ‘cause they loving it
Pockets fat like the Klumps in it, my flow is something sick, no asking
Proactive couldn’t stop bumping it, nowadays I be on some other shit
Ladies think I’m gone kinda like my upper lip, wrong
Like a broken condom, pause, ‘cause Hoff go raw
It’s something you really shouldn’t be fucking with
Came through whipping, paint still dripping
They say like Sheneneh, oh no you didn’t
Know that one saying when your palm start itching?
Well mine do some much, I had to start to wear mittens
And you think that I’m kidding, if I don’t slow down
They gon’ think that I’m driven, if I don’t go down, she gon’ think I hate fishing
Chill for a minute and I was like listen, Vizzy, gettin’, gettin’, gettin’
Y’all motherfuckers know I’m about to spit it straight up off the top of the dome again
How this nigga doing that? He be going in, I don’t even know shit
I be just blowing shit, I don’t even smoke and shit, how you know this?
By enrolling it, I don’t even know I got a backpack on
If you see me, take a flick of me and you niggas gonna blow the shit
‘Cause you were pointing at me like he gonna blow and shit
And them niggas be knowing it, if I be doing this shit all around the world and shit
All around the globe with it, man y’all niggas spit it in, I just get it in
Flow out here and manager from Switzerland, nigga from Kansas
And y’all niggas whipping it, how you motherfuckers doing it?



[Intro]
For all my ville niggas man
All my Carolina niggas man, (lights off and shit)
All my real niggas, no matter where you come from

[Verse]
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'mma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, "Honey, I'm home."
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer

You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man
My niggas know about the struggle, man
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma



[Intro]
Yeah, aye wassup man? Aye, uh, aye look man, can I- can I get on- can I just get on this bus? All I got is a dollar fifty, I'm just sayin'. I just tryna get- I'm tryna get on the bus, man. I ain't got no mon- all I got is a dollar fifty, I don't go two dollars. Man, fuck you and yo' bus, nigga!
(Yeah)
Hey, hey (Yeah, got a dollar and a dream)
Yeah, yeah
I got a dollar and a dream (Yeah), yeah
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, hey (Hey, I'm dreamin')

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh)
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that (Past that), a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq (Uh-huh)
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle, nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spittin'
This that pulpit, I’m hittin' niggas with the gospel (And the lord said)
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your mama or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of siftin' through my mail, I feel like Cartwright, bills (Bills and bills and bills)
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talkin', man, I know how niggas feel

[Chorus]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(God damn, nigga. These motherfuckin' bill collectors, man)
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(Can't even God damn turn on my phone without these nigga ringin' me up)
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(They tryna call me from different numbers and shit. Tryna- tryna fool me, nigga. I'm Lil Cole, nigga!)
Yeah, got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seem
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king (Uh-huh)
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump (Haha)
They shootin' niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinkin' that I’m slangin', man, I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar, plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and looked away like she want it
I ain't sayin' I'ma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirt with a nigga, this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first (Nah)
This is church, this is gospel (And the lord said)
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Yeah, ayy, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh-uh, uh, uh)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Wait 'til I get my money ri- hehehehe)
Everything ain't what it seem
Yeah, I got a dollar and a dream, yeah, I got a dollar and a dream
(Wait 'til I get my money right, I'm dreamin')

[Verse 3]
Check it
Aye Sallie, I know I ain't been answerin' your calls (Aww, not this bitch, yeah)
But shit, let me explain- (I can explain, I can explain)
It's because times been hard
Been runnin' 'round tryna find a job (I can't get no job)
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you (God damn), can't even front, I press ignore (Yeah)
I still got your letters layin' in my dresser drawer (Haha)
You tellin' me about all the things you did for me (I know, I know, I know, I know)
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me (I know, I know, big for me)
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my mama cosigned (Haha, yeah)
But in no time, a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl, I'm sad to say it
But I was usin' you, you gave a nigga major stacks (Major stacks)
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gon' pay you back
I got a dollar and a dream

[Outro]
I'll pay you back. Look, can we- can we set up some type of payment plan or somethin'? Like, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, you know? I just graduated six months ago so you know, times is kinda- times is kinda hard, baby. I- I just- can I just pay you like a lil' bit right now and then I pay you- I pay you the rest next- next month when I get paid. Can I just do somethin' like that? I gotta- I'm not even gon' lie to you, I don't, I don't really have it right now. I gotta pay how much? Five thousand dol- Aw, nigga is you crazy? Bitch you lucky I even answered the phone, I shouldn't have even picked up this motherfucker, I s- Look, what's ya- what's ya name? Can I- can I speak to a manager? You are the manager? Look, look can I speak to yo' manager? Who's- who owns this motherfucker? Let me talk to the owner! God damn it, I ain't- y'all niggas crazy... hahaha



[Intro]
Yeah, hey, Cole world

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

[Bridge]
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a Dream in case she know

[Hook]
That's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, ya'll on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? my fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "Goddamn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, "Bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will
Cole!

[Bridge]
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow

Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Outro]
Hey, 'cause nigga that's life, and trust me I'm livin'
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given
Look what a nigga made out
Look what a nigga made out
Got a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2: JID]
Okay, lil' dirty, nappy-headed East Atlanta nigga
Father said that I was a force
.44, Hank Aaron chrome
Wanna make it home? Then get out the Porsche
Let a nigga cover FADER 'fore I have to fade a nigga at the FADER Fort
It’s tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown
I was bored of education, left the town
Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check
Nigga, that's now

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 3: Bas]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Picked up the pad, picked up the slack
Pick of the litter, don't litter no bag
Bassy been pickin’ up racks, raps comin’ clearer than Acuvue 2
And I'm back in the booth
Got ’em hackin' a Shaq 'cause they lackin' the juice
Niggas droppin’ the ball, they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Actavis drool down the side of yo face
We ain't jackin' it, we ain't dappin' them fools
Get a napkin, you dudes is embarassin'
Who going crazy like us? No comparison
Dreamville like Marion Jones on the steroids
Y'all niggas slow as a heroin high
Y'all had a year, y'all had a year
Y'all had a year, but you let it go by
Yee

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
That poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T.​
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God

[Verse 5: Johnny Venus]
You could die today, so be hell to pay
I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony
So don't test me, homie, put that in ya, homie
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattoo'd on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend (Oh)

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 2: JID]
Okay, lil' dirty, nappy-headed East Atlanta nigga
Father said that I was a force
.44, Hank Aaron chrome
When I make it home, then get out the Porsche
Let a nigga cover FADER 'fore I have to fade a nigga at the FADER Fort
It's tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown
I was bored of education, left the town
Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check
Nigga, that's now

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)

[J.Cole]

(Cole World)

[Verse 1]
Now you can choose the easy or hard way
Cole took the long way
A loser car-ley I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jay’s lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC A 'n' T, where I found that TNA
Ain’t seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasn’t nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They waitin' on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappin' in diapers
To rappin' in cyphers
Ta doing more numbers
Then all them fuckin' lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you 'bout to get
Take a bite rock wit it
And I love a bad bitch with confidence
Yo smile nice yo style right
And girl you got some mean thighs
So this right he is mean time
In between time

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Kirko bangz]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Only if you got that sip type
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Outro]
H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup
I got this drink in my cup
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, uh, yo
You gotta li—, you gotta follow me
With what I'm doin' right here, mane
Like, when I say this shit is crazy
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'—
Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Aye, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yo, I'm in Atlanta, bruh
Hit me back, lil' nigga

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now, elevate my status to "Gucci bag us"
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slapped stupid
East side little Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm a stallion, stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
I'm under pressure, smoking pressure, walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo Young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy, you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
"Niggas ain't seein' you, Venus"—shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills—my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm deep in premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my delivery
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time-limit, I'ma take what's mine, nigga
Ha—now, elevate my status to "Gucci bag us"
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now, elevate my status to "Gucci bag us"
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Outro: Johnny Venus]
If you want to act up
If you want to act up
Come, act up



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', at least not with us
Might see em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, uh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher and though I never met ya
I'm thinkin' God bless ya, the city tryna get ya

[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you bet your Momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screamin', "We miss ya!"

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, let's see God, I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny?
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery?
My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m trying to get clear, I’m tryna quit fear
Who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no, baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smoke screen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but it's no kings

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they tryna kill ya
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking "God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
Don’t even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the whole season, nigga, no re-runs
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds

[Bridge]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya

[Outro]
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong
'Cause ain't nothing wrong
Im not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass, I gotta ball
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball



Anuncios del McDonald's que me intentan convencer
De que su comida es buena y me recuerdan a esas que
Siguen mandándome mensajes queriendo volverme a ver
Pero no es sano repetir platos que ya comiste ayer
Por eso cuido mi dieta amiga
Comida rápida me da dolores de barriga
Y mucha fatiga pero nunca aprendo
Porque acabo en Burger King comiendo un whopper con patatas y bebida
Rechazo conciertos, no tengo equipo de directo
Nadie entiende lo que estoy haciendo
"El Jota ahora hace club o intenta rapear fresco"
Si vas a etiquetarme deja de tocarte cuando escuches esto
No miento, soy un tipo sincero y sin músculos
Que no puede correrse con tu poster de Crepúsculo
Y cuando te conozco y veo el asunto sucio
Mal rollo como si te follo con Spotify y salta el anuncio
En tu cama dolor de barriga, frio y sudor
No es tu culpa quilla, seguro que soy yo
Pero hay cosas que no están bien y me ponen enfermo del to
Como el gilipollas que pegó a su madre en "Hermano Mayor"
Aquí te graba "Callejeros" en un control
Ciego y haciendo el mongolo y eres el nuevo ídolo español
Y es tal la relevancia
Que llevan al tipo al programa de turno pa aplaudirle las gracias

El mundo está roto y no existen tiritas tan grandes
Cuando te das cuenta del juego es demasiao tarde
Igual que con esos buenos amigos sinceros
Que dejan de serlo cuando hay tías y dinero de por medio
Mi vida está entre la música y las mujeres
Entre medio el alcohol y tú ¿de quien coño eres?
Se que eres casi como yo, gente de fe
Tropezamos con la misma piedra esperando que todo esté bien esta vez
Pero no, y otra vez y otra y otra...
Todas se lían con todos, todos se lían con todas
Todos consumen drogas, ¿a quién le importa?
A otros las drogas les consumen, y el lunes se pegan la torta
Al enfrentarse con la realidad
Y yo no soy nadie para juzgar tu manera de escapar
Es solo que tenéis muchas cosas en común de verdad
Y yo no sé excusarme con que estoy en esa edad de experimentar
Si me dices que te gusta meterte nosequé
O historias de que te has follao a varios tíos a la vez
O que sales el viernes y llegas el domingo, despídete
No eres mi tipo, me voy a ver Indiana Jones III
Y qué más da, este soy yo, y he usado el tono de J.Cole
Dando suficientes motivos para que un entendido
Con el cráneo más apretao que un bañador Speedo
Diga que soy un copión o sospechosamente parecido
Hago lo que quiero, esto es pa divertirme
O pa sacar lo que me quema dentro antes de irme
El tema de este beat se llama "Lights Please"
Asique enciendan las luces por favor así sabré donde tengo que ir



Γάμα την τύχη με έχουν πιάσει ορμές
Να τις μετρήσω δεν μπορώ μα πλέον είναι πολλές
Έχω πουλήσει όταν δεν είχα και έχω κάνει κλοπές
Έχω δει την πανάγια όχι μια και 2 φόρες

Είμαι εδώ που ήμουν χθες να'σαι δω που είμαι θες
Θα σας γαμούσα μα sorry μα δεν γαμάω αδερφές
Εκτός και αν είναι αδερφές αστό ότι είναι αμαρτωλές
Ένας χρόνος ο σεφτές σας στις ιερές σας δουλείες

Το Glock στην μούρη
Το μυαλό μου σφαίρα δύναμη
Δεν πήγατε πότε πουθενά γιατί είστε ανίκανοι
Έκανα μελί τα σκατά
Και το πιο φοου την ρίγανη
Τα πάντα απο το τίποτα την μάνα μου περήφανη

Δεν πήρα ίσιο δρόμο προτιμώ τον επικίνδυνο
Δεν είμαι rapper το rap μου ήταν το κίνητρο
Πέτυχα στα θέλω μου ενώ θέλουν να με φάνε
Όλοι είναι ζώα και χωρίς εξαιρέσεις όλοι πεινάμε

Θυμάμαι ποτέ δεν ξέχασα όσα πονάνε
Άνθρωποι έρχονται και πάνε μείναμε μ'οσους μ'αγαπανε
Δεν πονάω ότι και αν χτυπάνε,λίγοι ξέρουν τι περνάμε
Αν φοβάμαι,ρωτά τις καρδιές μας αν χτυπάνε...

Γάμα την μόδα αυτό είναι στυλ καριόλα
Πουτάνας γιοι μπροστά μιλάνε ζητάνε να φάνε φόλα
Πουλί στον οισοφάγο πόρνη βούλωσε το στόμα
Είναι μέχρι να τους πετύχω να φτάσει στην πλάτη σόλα

Δεν έχω πλάτες παίζω solo και αφού
Έγιναν rappers πια γιατί δώσανε κώλο παντού
Έχω την τάση να ανεβαίνω jim boss άλλου
Δεν με έκανε μάγκα το φοου μάγκα δεν πίνω καν φοου

Eίμαι στο περιθώριο πως να βρεθώ ανάμεσα
Αν το έκανα το γούσταρα πότε δεν το μετάνιωσα
Ετών 18 κατάλαβα τι είναι οι πουτάνες
Αν δεν χώριζα δεν θα΄χα 4 ψηφία στην τράπεζα

Συναισθήματα μηδέν λίγα τα λογία μου
Πάτησα τα εμπόδια που βρέθηκαν στα ποδιά μου
Αγγλος στα ραντεβού μου πάντα βρίσκομαι στην ώρα μου
Βρομούσα ιδρώτα τώρα Burberry η κολόνια μου

Kαι αφού δεν έχω έμπνευση να γραψω αφήνομαι
Άσε το πως μιλάω το τι λέω η το πως ντύνομαι
Διχασμένη μου προσωπικότητα οι δυο μας μείναμε
Μου παν να γίνω άνθρωπος μα γάμα το δεν ψήνομαι

Πουλούσα κόκα στην Κρήτη στην τρίτη πεινάμε
Κακό παιδί καλή καρδιά τι χάσαμε και τι'χαμέ
Σ'ενα γυάλινο ποτήρι βότκα τα όνειρα πνιγήκανε
Σε έμαθα λοιπόν τα βρήκαμε,μιλήσαμε,χαθήκαμε

Και δεν έχω αντοχή να μιλάω για λύπες
Αν δεν ξέρεις τι είσαι τι ζητάς δεν ξέρεις κάνεις πίπες
Και δεν έχω δύναμη να αλλάζω ρόλους
Ότι έχεις τ΄εκτιμάς αλλιώς θα λες για όσα είχες

Όλες μου οι πρώην με μισούνε
Για κάτι που δεν είχα και έψαχναν για να το βρούνε
Μ'αγαπη να χαθούμε αν μ'αγαπησαν θα πούνε
Μ'αγάπησαν μόνο γιατί μ΄ακούνε

5 ζευγάρια Jordan στο ντουλάπι άλλα δυο στο ράφι
Βάζω ότι μου πάει και όχι ότι λάμπει
Πολλοί μου λένε ο TOQUEL έχει αλλάξει
Λέω ο TOQUEL έχει αρπάξει ευκαιρίες που πέταξαν κάπου κάποιοι

Αλλάζω δρόμους συχνά πατάω σε νομούς συχνά
Ο αλαζόνας μέσα μου ξυπνά σ'ωραρια νυχτερινά
Έχω τα λεφτά στο μυαλό μου και το μυαλό μου στα λεφτά
Είμαι υπόδειγμα για οποίον εκεί έξω πεινά

Πούστης δεν ήμουν πότε άπλα δεν με καυλώνεται
Στην 7η ενότητα ότι δεν λύνεται κόβεται
Μου έκανε δώρο η Cosmote ένα χρόνο τσάμπα κλήσεις πακέτο
Και το δωσα στην μαμά σου να μην χρεώνεται...



[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga



[Intro]
Path of Life coming soon
It's KDoubleU, check it

[Verse: KDoubleU]
Everybody dies do what you love while you here bro
That's why I stay kicking the shit that you can hear bro
I fear no, thing I just like to share those
Emotions I keep in my heart with a weird flow
And deep voice i'm noice stay stunning dudes
Check it out got my album Path of Life coming soon
And as we journey down the Path of Life
We gon' find mad people who ain't acting right
That say fuck love and only care to get ass tonight
And would willingly give you up as a sacrifice
Me staying strong and being tough is me as fuck
Loving this shit and knowledge I stay eating up
Got one life to live I do what I love dude
And with persistence my fucking dream will come true
I'm strong, and overjoyed and i'm blessed bruh
Stay tuned for Path of Life coming next month, yea

[Outro]
The studio version
Had to get in the mothafucking booth and record this shit officially haha
Path of life coming soon, stay tuned for it
I'm out



[Snippet]
(Let me live, let me live, let me live)
Peak in my life, check if you like just what you see
Though you might disagree with my plight
This shit that I write is just like therapeutic for me
There's no shooters for me
Just some niggas that wanna prove to me they down
I rarely bring 'em 'round, cause they still stuck in their ways
Mindstate still the same
Can't help nobody till they ready to change
But I don't give up, I'll be here waiting for you the day you decide that you'll no longer be a slave to your pride
Until then, keep your head on a swivel
For my niggas that dibble, dabble in street life
Hopin' to get a nibble of American pie, equality
An arrogant lie
Told louder by the people that hold power
Listen, this is a setup
I know you feel the rush that niggas get when dollars switch hands
And you can say you got your bread up
But don't be short sighted
See, it's a war that's goin' on outside
Nigga, you got to know about this shit to fight it
I wanna help you through
I'm on the road to sanity with all humanity behind us
Hope they comin' too
These words I spoke are nothin' new
There's nothin' that I [...]
There's nothin' that you cannot do
The truth is right aside of you
Through troubled waters just canoe
Have faith for something greater than to guide you through
These words are for all, me and you



[Intro]
Yeah, mmm
Ooh, ooh
Ooh (Shea butter baby)
(Throw it back, shea butter baby)
(Throw it back, shea butter baby)
(Throw it back, shea butter baby)
(Throw it back)

[Chorus]
Ah, gon' back that shit up on me
Back up all that shit you talkin'
FaceTimin' my baby tonight, oh
Bet you wanna cop a feel
Bet you wonder if it's real
FaceTimin' my baby tonight

[Refrain]
And when you comin' home
I'm gon' give you all of my love
I'm gon' put it on you
I said, ooh, you hell of a drug
Been gone long
I'm gon' give you all of my love
I'm gon' put it on you, ooh

[Chorus]
Gon' back that shit up on me
Back up all that shit you talkin'
FaceTimin' my baby tonight, oh
Bet you wanna cop a feel
Bet you wonder if it's real
FaceTimin' my baby tonight

[Refrain]
And when you comin' home
I'm gon' give you all of my love

I said, ooh, you hell of a drug
Been gone long

I'm gon' put it on you, ooh

[Outro]
Ooh (Shea butter baby)
Yeah (Throw it back, shea butter baby)
(Throw it back, shea butter baby)
Oh (Throw it back, shea butter baby)
(Throw it back)
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Mmm, oh



[Intro]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets



[Intro]
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
Look, some niggas let their dirt out some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade; a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint? Glorify me, over-think?
Say they know me, say I’m great? Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me that they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man

[Hook]
This for them niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a pre-nup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing

[Hook]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah



[Intro]
Damn, I thought I had it all figured it out
Especially when it came to relationships and girls
But just when I least expected it
Love, rearranged my whole world

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played 'em, high school, played 'em
College, well, you know, played 'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade 'em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalant can I be, with you here staring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever see
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it

(J. Cole, baby bro, speak)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not so fast, Cole got a whole lotta lotto cash
Life of a bachelor, light skinned rapper
Found a top model with a Tahoe ass
With a broad so bad, when she cross your path
You get her outta them jeans you be thinking about rings
Okay she done got your ass
Cupid done shot your ass
But I'm trying to be a G though
So yeah, I'm gonna holler, yeah I'm gonna call her
But I ain't got a leash though
Uh, I put a name on a lease though
Get an extra set of my keys for
I think I might wife it now
But life is foul and you don’t got a free throw
Uh, and so my next move gon' have to be my best move
Beside every king is a bad ass queen
So girl let's make this chess move

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
Now baby, baby
You doin' things with my heart ain't never felt, its so crazy
I agree to acknowledge love if you gonna let it change me
I was so mistaken
Your love like a Bentley coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby baby, for so long I miss somebody
My heart just couldn’t played with it
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn’t think I'd ever see
Me callin' to you, you voice before I go to sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sean Garrett]
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin' while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and I’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’
(Don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growing
(Don’t wanna miss out on a feeling I ain't never had before)
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you done done to me, I gotta let ’em know

[Hook]

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
I’d swore I’d never fall, but I fell
Run and tell all my old hoes
Erase my number, my photos
Uh, baby girl pardon me but
Don’t text, stop calling me
I ain't your nigga, don’t bother me
Fuck your Twitter, don’t follow me
My new girl too thorough
Believe it or not, man, she’s all I need
Thought I was a player, R.I.P
Down goes Frazier, call Ali
Let's hit the mall and its all on me
Cause girl you deserve it
If I take this chance and make these plans
I gotta know girl is you worth it? Perfect



Bro you can't rap you better leave the stage Before you get shame


I'm Godly and just for a fact i would win you can't  your hairline is in your back stop taking crap Because you suck  you don't  have fans  all you do is lay on the ground with your McDonald's in your hand you should get off stage  Before you get Roasted and salty i will Roast you like ham and beff to easy for me  idk anymore push me to the flow then i let it go you should go play some jailbreak little kid so
Go cry to your dad with your rags man you suck better leave

*drops mic

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved



[Intro]
Yeah nigga
S.E. muh'fuckin' Gang nigga
You already know what it is nigga
Griselda nigga
Look

[Verse]
I ain't talkin' to one, I'm talkin' to all of you
Stay in your lane, I promise I will off you
Okay I'm sorry if I lost you
But this ain't what happened to Mike, these young niggas'll cross you
If I'm Mike and you Allen, scrap
Look what Mike did for the game and look where Allen at
I mean where the fuck is the talent at?
These niggas diss and I'm like where the fuck is the Talon at?
You think it's an indirect, I ain't name a nigga
Shootin' at everybody, I ain't aimin' nigga
I'll put you on the news, make you famous nigga
I'm undefeated but they hatin' like I'm [?], nigga
Revenge served better as a cold dish
Empty whole clip, leave his body cold stiff
In VIP, let the hoes sit
30 gold bottles, roll the whole zip
Million followers, you thinkin' she a cold bitch
Your WCW my old bitch
Bought a nine, front a nine, that's a whole split
Oh shit, I'm only 18 on my whole brick
Gotta give the credit when the credit's due
That's what you better do when a nigga better than you
Your head'll get lead in it from my revenue
Drop my new record, I'm sellin' it like the Legend Blue 11's
I'm a legend, you never going to put a hand on me
Without losin your fuckin' hand, homie
Caught a ki of sour for the band on me
I got it out of L.A. like D'Antoni
The kush good, but the sour special
Yellow diamonds all around the bezel
Don't compare me to these niggas on the bottom level
Lyrically I'm Kweli, you a Rowdy Rebel
It's funny how things change
I got shot in the head bitch, I seen pain
I'm homie from the SE Gang
I play my role just fuckin' your mommas like Ving Rhames
Supreme hoodie on, three chains
My bars hit you equivalent to RGIII knee pain
Aw fuck it, I'm 'bout to sling 'caine
Throwin' powder around on my King James
I tried bein' modest
But you niggas can't fuck with me, fuck it let's be honest
But don't be mad at me that you niggas don't get acknowledged
Be mad at your homies nigga
They should've told you you garbage
You hear my flow, my nigga? My shit is polished
We can go song for song, I promise you'll get demolished
Me and you niggas never get along
My dick big and long, so it's fuck the world to a Biggie song

[Outro]
Yeah nigga
Aw man
This shit is funny to me man
Peon ass niggas man
I wish one of you niggas would
I'd smack a tooth out y'all niggas mouth man
Fuck be wrong with you niggas man?
And this at whoever man, whatever nigga
How you want it? When you want it nigga?
You already know how it go nigga



[Hook]
Now everybody say the city dead
But I don’t give a fuck what a hater ever said
‘Cause these cats is only in this shit for shine
So fuck them motherfuckas, we don’t need ‘em on our side
Now my people, yeah, we about to have a run
We blast these motherfuckas from the shadow of a gun
I don’t care if y’all ain’t fuckin’ with the squad
I ain’t scared of any man, I don’t fear no one but God

[Verse One]
There ain’t no way around it no more, the city faded
‘Cause ain’t nobody passin’ the torch so we gotta take it
We used to be the front of this music culture but lately
We all been dickridin’ and chasin’ Jiggy and Mackey
Who’s the king? Ain’t nobody, fuck it, the throne is vacant
The kingdom burn to the ground and the castle there for the taking
This culture was created from struggle, the early 80s
Late 70s breakin’, Fort Apache, Reagan
Started floodin’ ghettos with crack, AIDS and the weapons
And instead of education, our pathway was to Heaven now
Know this shit is tired and passé, we mention it
The way it used to be but fuck it, class is session, learn something
We bumpin’ Bambaataa on Planet Rock
Same time, Warhol was fuckin’ with Basquiat
When Big Daddy Kane had Madonna all on his cock
There were whores on 42nd, Giuliani had ‘em locked

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Yeah, I remember, radio broke records
When New York City was still a cultural mecca
I don’t think that Rick Rubin’ll ever pose for the camera
But them labels had another agenda
They been pimpin’ the artists for years, fuck’em
Even when artists run and we used to set all the trends
But now we follow what’s comin’
Or they regurgitating the same shit that we done with
And we sellin’ all them lies to the public
So fuck it, ain’t showin’ ‘em any love
We told ‘em that they are dumb
We takin’ shots at you bitches
You lookin’ like sittin’ ducks, agh
This compromise is like a threesome, yeah
The only way it work is if everybody gettin’ fucked
I’m livin’ up in the neighborhood that they gentrifyin’
While racial tensions are everywhere and intensifyin’
They show us violence on TV and they desensitize us
Then they call us sociopaths because we never cryin’
It’s death defyin’, the lies that we livin’
We findin’ the peace in the drugs that we can’t find in religion, amen
But the city expensive, we all get evicted
It’s no wonder that we strugglin’ in it

[Bridge]
Now everybody say the city dead
But I don’t give a fuck what a hater ever said
‘Cause these cats is only in this shit for shine
So fuck them motherfuckas, we don’t need ‘em on our side

[Verse Three]
I heard they said the city is dead and I had to side
‘Cause Jesus had to die on the cross so he could rise
Blame it on the media or blame it on the times
Or blame it on them old cats that ain’t lettin’ go of they shine
Who’s the king?
Now I don’t mean any disrespect to the legends
Who’s the king?
If you don’t pass us the torch, we gon’ burn you with it
Who’s the king?
I got respect for your run but the shit is finished
You killin’ your legacy like when Jordan played for the Wizards
Put a spell in ‘em, if they ain't fuckin’ with us, to hell with ‘em
The only industry where you fail if you sound intelligent
Posted at the spot, I’m with Grin and with all my brethren, aye
Like fuck it, we gon’ build a new crib if they don’t let us in
Who’s the king?
‘Cause Fort Apache the squad homie, we reppin’
Our team is full of entrepreneurs and not expenses
And everybody with us contributin’, no exceptions
We doin’ all this shit till the death of us, I told ‘em…

[Outro]
Everybody wanna be the king of New York
(Yeah, I wanna be the king of New York)
There ain’t no throne
Everybody fightin’ over a fuckin’ foldin’ chair
(It’s my crown! It’s my crown! It’s mine!)
It’s the empire of dirt (It’s mine! It’s all mine! I love it!)
We need to build a community, we need to support each other
We need to make sure the media cannot ignore
The community that we built like they been doin’
We need to develop and cultivate our own sound
And we need to hold these older artists accountable
(Everybody worship me! Everybody love me!)
Make sure they fuck with us and help nurture us
(It’s about me, I want it all, I want it all for me)
The way they do in other regions
(I refuse to give it to anybody else)
These young stars that keep poppin’ off without the co-signs
The go-aheads of these other motherfuckas in their cities man
(I need all the hoes! I need all the hoes! I need all the hoes!)
But instead you got these old watch motherfuckas
Clingin’ onto the shadow of the runs they had 15 years ago
I’m sick of that shit, fuck all these motherfuckas
I respect what they did, I respect they contribution to Hip-Hop
Fuck them, their time is done
You get mad that I’m talkin’ about you, really?
A lot of motherfuckas out there doin’ shit
A lot of cats ain’t scared to step outside
I be wonderin’ sometimes like is it ego?
Are y’all bank accounts just not full?
You just can’t let go of your glory days?
It’s aight, Fort Apache



[Hook]
Now everybody who looked down on me
And told me I was nothing
For everybody who said I wouldn't evolve to something
For everybody who studied me without saying nothing
Let me tell you something
I don't fuck with y'all

[Verse 1: Billy Pastor]
They told me stop and pause
Just because I was well involved
With the claps and kick on a drum
On a sample that's soon to come
From a kid my age with a gun
Or cop with a lethal stun
Or cop with a lethal gun
Ugh
You think you scare me?
You really think you scare me?
Break ya legs and leave you in the woods
Like you was Bambi, Like you was handi-cap
Break ya fucking back with 7 bats from Satan's shack
I promised God that I'd be all I can be
I can't be, washed up
I'm killing you industry bitches
Kicking back with the pump
Matter fact I'm retaliating with aid from the fathers son and
I'm praying like every night cause I might just never wake up

[Verse 2: Billy Pastor]
Wake up and see the truth behind my composition
Cause I've been writing on a mission
Since the age of Christians
I wrote the Bible I wrote the guide for survival
I wrote you the 10 commandments
Religion bringing revival
Revival
Reviving my dead disciples
I'm cycling through ya catalog can you be more insightful
Ya spiteful you couldn't snipe me with the strongest rifle
All right folks enough with child's play
It's the day and it's looking grey
And it's looking like it's the day
That I rain on ya camps parade
Well you was never partying or celebrating either
I drop the hottest ether
Like Nas when I grab the heater
Or when I go extinguish
Diminish your greatest leader
I'm, smoking sipping liters
And killing you with no features
Cause I don't need em I never need them
I never will
A one man band with the pen and heart in his hands just to kill

[Verse 3: Billy Pastor]
I wrote my will I got the will power
I will, never be defeated
By amateurs that ain't speaking the truth
When they in the booth
Either that or they simply sleeping
Expecting someone to feed them
But this hip-hop no mercy coming your way
I got this shit locked no commissary today
And if you blink drop cause bullets flying ya way
And if you bust back I'll be at your funeral date
Wait, no stop pause
I just had 6 broads tell your music is garbage
And you a little bitch
Well did I mention that this is fire squad
About time that I fire back

[Verse 4: Billy Pastor]
I've been sitting patiently
Watching the game
That's made to be played by the greater artists
That going hard to give great relief
I believe that I'm one of the m
I believe I'm son of them
I believe that I'm sonning
These local artists that's sucking em

[Bridge x2: Billy Pastor]
Ugh, I can go on this beat forever
Ugh, I'd rather not I'm too clever
Ugh, I'm spitting this for the better
Ugh, it's about time that I pull the

Yo, I can go on this beat forever
I can go on this beat forever
I'd rather not I'm too clever
Oh. I'm spitting this for the better
I can go on this beat forever
I'd rather not I'm too clever
It's about time that I pull the fucking lever

[Verse 5: Billy Pastor]
Now everybody from my state is thinking that they hot
In reality they ain't even boiling in the pot
It's sad to see so many wannabe's around my block
Man it's sad to see not one of em beating me I should stop
But actually they all on my dick and they need to see
That I am not they ticket to leave I am not the key
I'm just here to remind ya that none of you seeing me
I'm the best in the west the best in the east and the 203
Peace



[Intro]
Hey, hey!
Hey, yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, up top, hands, sing

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone
And saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day you'll have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
Who's the king?
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy lose the Grammy as a nigga crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?



[Intro: Rick Ross]
Beat Billionaire
You know I stick to the script

My chick black and white, she ain't no dime, that bitch a Concord 11
Know I'm reppin' this, shoot and I don't ever miss
The coupe I'm in is rented, I ain't wit' all that commitment shit
P-R-Ps is proper, couple Gs when I'm shoppin'
My girls and my SBs, got a thing for pink boxes
Shout out Frankie the Butcher, shout out Mishka in Brooklyn
That's some nigga from 10.deep ATL, I’m wit' the cooker
I ain't even tryna fool, ho, I ball like private school
You bammas like Hyperstrikes, your wifey sleep outside of you
And NT my niggas, you know just we just need more shit and
It's ironic how I drop some dough when I got them Homer Simpsons
Look, pine green Foams, they may never see the store
Got LeBron Entourages like Maverick and Richie Paul
Bitch, I ball, ho, you lame, look at my Laneys, switchin' lanes
Look at my 9s, look at my Blazers, look at my 4s, cut wit' laser
Look at my whore, that is your lady
Look at my flo', makin' y'all crazy
Makin' y'all sick, y'all cannot tame me
Lexus drive me, Maybach pay me
Salute

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yo, I said I'm swaggin' out in my Cool Greys
No LL, but these cool J's
And my wrist froze, but I'm cool sha'
Like a bald head, I'm too paid
I'm too blazed, and I'm too high
George Kush, the whole crew high
Wrong move and that tool fly
Better calm that ass like woo-sah
It's MMG, MOB, young nigga, I been OG
Walk around wit' like 10 on me, that 5-7, that fen' on me
Don’t grin on me wit' them long stares
You ain't God then there's no fear
Big money, all the hoes here, HD, I see it so clear
We jeweled out and we racked up
Phantom beep when it back up
Big bullets, look like a Mack truck
Shooters ride wit' that Mac tucked
I'm a Bad Boy, bitch, ask Puff
Sip Cîroc it's my last cup
On this shit, I can't stand up
Catch a case and I'll man up
This Rozay, Wale, Gunplay, and that nigga Pill
In Brazil, and this shit is real, got bad hoes and that Whip Appeal
One week and we get the deal, one day and I fucked the bitch
My Levis, they 501, my snapback is hella bent, ha

My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap

Fresh-ass nigga, no wonder why them hoes be open
That’s that nigga, so what'd I say? They okey-dokin'
How you figga? You fuckin' wit' me? I hope he jokin'
I'm witcha girl, you home alone, bitch you Macauley Culkin
I'm oviedosin', ayy, homie, Cole be smokin'
Then put my ashes on you niggas, bet you gon' need lotion
I'm slowly roastin', heatin' up, so you know we toastin’
Fuck hoes wit' no emotion, fade away like Kobe postin'
Out in Sweden, like ain't shit that you can't tell us
Lord, forgive me, as a kid, I used to look at niggas jealous
'Cause uh, they had them J's, and my mama wouldn't cop 'em
Can you blame her? Hundred dollars for them bitches want a option
Now we livin' much better, nigga, pay whatever
Rock them bitches once then forgot about 'em forever
My kicks like my chick, I don't need to know the numbers
You just need to know I'm comin', I'll kill you niggas this summer
Cole... Cole, World

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Bridge]
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Higher, higher
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Revenge)

[Verse]
Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat Turner in my past life
Bob Marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
Who survived against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
Who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago, the game snatch a nigga’s spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
First thing they do is throw their shade
Word?—errr—I swerve like a Thunderbird on the curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scriptures
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive
Back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "Hello", just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil
You can tell him Cole just sent you now

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah—higher, higher
Yeah, yeah—higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
I can come around, shit, whenever you want
I can come around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
Me, me, me, me, me, me

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, took a lil' sip
T-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch

[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Ight, look look, park right here
I'ma be out it'll be like thirty minutes tops
It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let me see that, oh shit what is that some
What's, what the fuck is that platinum
Is that? What's that chain right there
Is that-ss-ss white gold, that's platinum
Is that plat, well niggas doing platinum again, niggas doing, niggas ain't even platinum yet right, oh shit bout to make
Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch



[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king
Cole is the king
D.Koms
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven

[Intro]
I see the, I see the—
I see the, I see the—
I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

[Verse]
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord

[Chorus]
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

[Outro]
Bells gettin' louder, louder
I see the rain
Pouring down



[Intro: Bas]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same story, same hoe
Same thing, same Correy

[Chorus: Correy C]
I had her waiting, she was tryna go back to my location

Damn you smellin' good, I love your fragrance
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to snatch that (I had to snatch that)
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to smash that (I had to smash that)

But she still came back, came back yeah
Damn she still came back, came back
No, I don't need shit, I'm good, I'm chillin'
No, I don't need shit, I'm good, I'm good
Treat the Backwood like a treasure map
Throw it back girl, I can handle that
But I ain't really tryna spend the time (no time)
Why you always blowin' up my line?
Why you always tryna get on my buzz?
Holla at my niggas, get off my nuts (oh God)

[Chorus: Correy C]
I had her waiting, she was tryna go back to my location
She ain't no doctor, got no patience

[Verse 2: Bas]
She got tats like strippers, she got ass like strippers
She got sass, she got plans, she ain't ask for a picture
She know just what she came for (she know)
She got just what she came for (she did)
I'ma run it up, throw the dueces up, fuck we playin' all the games for?
I know the truth about you, we know the truth about you
You want money, fame, all the things the game brings, girl it's such a shame
But I ain't really tryna spend the time (no time)
Why you always blowin' up my line?
Why you always tryna get on my buzz?
Holla at my niggas, get off my nuts (oh God)

[Chorus: Correy C]
I had her waiting, she was tryna go back to my location
She ain't no doctor, got no patience

But then you got annoying had to let you go (had to let you go)
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know

[Outro: Correy C]
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you go
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know
If I said it then I meant it, I had to let you go
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
The game need balance, the game need balance
Woke up this morning to the rumors of niggas wilding
Picture me hating on a young nigga with talent
Album flop, but it's cool, he caked out on his allowance
I was out in Vegas, Kicks was the latest
Bitch was the baddest, her head was the greatest
Only one thing that I ask of you haters
You can't diss a nigga if you got him on your playlist
From straight A's to A-list, Only niggas with AK's can play this
My Jordan's thirteen like eighth grade, You niggas debaters
But you ignoring my pay raise
I made it from 8 dollars an hour, that's 400 a week
To 100 grand a show, that's 400 a week
Ice and wrist, It's Cole summer to keep
Life's a bitch, Just don't cum in the sheets



[Verse]
Crack music, nigga...get smacked music, nigga!
Look, you see them ruby red diamonds on my ice
You can call it what you want shit'll prolly change ya life
If you stole it and you pawned it
You should prolly think twice, well connected so I'm on it
Well connected on yo flight, you niggas be writing sonnets writing sonnets
Like we miss you we miss you
Mama go get the tissue
Them things start blastin, Mark Jackson can't assist you
Life cut short like initials, raps or the pistols
One way or another, I'mma uplift you BLAOW!!
You believe me, then you crazy
All these little niggas out here wanna be me but they lazy
Step ya game up get ya name up
Look how I came up
Remember this bitch in high school I liked said I was lame but
I played it off Deep down I was ashamed
But walking through these hallways, all you got is your name
The boy she liked was g-like and very slang
Whips and fresh clothes and so they doing they thang
I ain't good enough
I ain't hood enough
This older nigga stepped up to me at my locker I said put em up ready to jab at
Much to my surprise that nigga backed back
And went about his way
I threw my notebook in my backpack
Walked home just to get my thoughts goin
It’s a hardcore world if they think you soft porn
Niggas will try to fuck you
And steal, rob, or cut you
And we ain't sellin dope but we still gotta hustle
And this that crack music, nigga thatget smacked music, nigga!



[Intro]
Yeah
Almost
Almost
Hm
Damn
Hey

[Verse]
So here we are
So here we are
So here we are, it's funny how so close can seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far, funny how so close can seem so far I mean
Nigga, this is your moment
Damn, this is your moment
Damn, this supposed to be your moment, ain't it?

What good is being the one when you the only one that knows it?

Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Bridge: J. Cole]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

[Verse: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Outro: J. Cole]
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today



[Intro]
Riding 'round the town ducking my old bitches, old

[Verse 1]
Riding 'round the town ducking my old bitches
You ain't hold me down 'til a nigga came up
Why you want me now? What's the focus? Wait, I know
You was pressing dial and my name came up (right)

[Bridge]
I've been off it and I've been gone for weeks, still smell the set up
Put her on repeat, can't put no pussy on a pedestal
I be home all week, so for a week she in stilettos
Call me when you need, only when you- ooh
I've been off it and I've been gone for weeks, still smell the set up
Put her on repeat, can't put no pussy on a pedestal
I be home all week, so for a week she in stilettos
Call me when you need, only when you-

[Chorus]
Oh you heading out of town with your bestfriend
I ain't front desk bitch you ain't gotta check in, hey (yeah, yeah)
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back, back
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back

[Verse 2]
I'm going OT for the week
Double OT for the weekend
Got me a freak and she geeking
She talk a lot when she peaking
Speaking 'bout life, drama and her current affairs, let‘s bury it there
I got enough problems, got no worries or care, spare you an ear
And she think that's me on the internet
She don't know me that's the internet
She just get high off my intellect
I just get high tell her "give me neck"
My mind on this check (you know what I'm saying)
My mind on this check (just know I ain't playing)
My mind on this check (this money of mine)
My mind on this check (that's all on my mind)

[Chorus]
Oh you heading out of town with your bestfriend
I ain't front desk bitch you ain't gotta check in, hey (yeah, yeah)
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back, back
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back

[Outro]
Lust persists, why pretend?
I can't tell no lie, bitch I'm too poppin' now
Empty bottles, empty promises
I can't tell no lie, bitch I'm too poppin' now



[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
We out here moving, J. Cole is here
This has happened before
When the mics are set up like this
You know something's gonna happen

[Break: J. Cole]
Is it on me?
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
You see us, baby
Funk Flex, J. Cole
Who you mad at, me or yourself

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before "Work Out" I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
HOT 97, baby!!!

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Look
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?

[Break: J. Cole]
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever



[Verse 1]
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this Range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin, I never liked carrots
But now I'm older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar, more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but nowadays more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, I'm all on the Billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga, I could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at Warren Buffett
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a Ford, ironic 'cause I explore
Nigga I explore!

[Verse 2]
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy, I can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If I slip I grab the rail, I'll get a grip and never fail

[Verse 3]
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if I ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga



[Intro]

[Verse]
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that

[Outro]
Nobodies feelings getting hurt, nobody getting mad

[Intro: J Cole]
LA, NC, NY
The Chi, yea, hey, yea

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I wake up, hop out the shower spray cologne on while im dressing
They hollering about recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, Im live and breathing so to me that there’s a blessing
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no “F” in
Stepping out today, I got leave the crib
Momma stressing , I pray
That ain't no body gon’ pull the weapon out and spray
Cuz I don’t got no strap
And ever since we hit the depression niggas don't know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya’ll feel the glare I got to go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her
I'm fronting “What's your name?”
She told me, “Boy, you know me, don’t play no games
Now, look, they say you blowing up, hey, is it true, fired up?”
I say, “Girl, they wasn’t kidding like they tubes tied up"

[Hook]
I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me whats work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world
Its just me and my favorite girl, now all around they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay so word is spreading
That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle cuz I know they used to say Jermaine
So who changed?
Whats in name though, when niggas can't hang on-your shoe strings
The flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me?- Im just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real
Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!
This is where they shooting sideways
Boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we high to get away
Now come here ladies see we trynna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon mix it with this Goose, don’t throw it up

[Hook]



[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring him 'round cause her homegirls’ll clown like
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bite size"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about her 5 year plan
She saying “who I’m fooling, they could never understand”
They could never understand

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I’m watching CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep ‘em niggas walking 'round blind all the time
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The single's only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparel
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of all the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates is a nigga fate
And why they call this shit a race
The agony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Bridge: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me

[Outro: 2Pac]
Don't support the Phoneys,Support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talkin about how they so real
And they don't care about our communities?
How can they be talkin about how they're all this you know
The hood and blah blah they don't care about the communities?
You know what I mean? Listen to the words they have in their lyrics
And tell me is that some real shit
And if that's real shit to you
You know what I mean? Listen to what they're saying to you
Don't just bob your head to the beat peep the game
And listen to what I'm saying & hold us accountable for it



[Intro]
Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse: 1]
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Peedi started
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures (Ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04
No disrespect to my favorite player
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich
So I'm slaying niggas, yeah

[Hook]
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it

[Verse: 2]
Niggas in the streets, no
Niggas blessed beats
I got that priest flow, heavenly
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock
Just a figure a speech for the Glock
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot (Yeah)
Like a beach yo, it's hot
Niggas laid out
Caught a fake nigga centerfield it's cause they played out
Watch our boys fade out, niggas tryna hate
If he only knew my dick's in his dame's mouth
Just made out, came out the wood-works
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork
I'm getting real green, y'all niggas playing on some good turf
Fake money, scared money, never make money
And a nigga never fear nothing but God
Fuck a facade
I'm just focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit
Nigga I
Yeah

[Hook]
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it

[Verse 3]
Tell 'em Geppettos my niggas in ghettos with Scarface dreams
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screens
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Sling dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yea it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break
They never wanted us to make it, yea
To my niggas smart enough to be smart enough to take it, nigga

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Okay, so I'm on the beat, what am I supposed to rhyme?
What am I supposed to do in this booth? Am I to flow a line?
What am I, a spokesman now? What am I, a poster child?
What am I supposed to smile?
What am I supposed to be the dopest MC to hold this down?
What if I wasn't poor as a child?
What if I didn't grow up in doubt?
I probably shouldn't be smoking so much, my mind is over fried
But still I notice how them same folks will smile
In your face, but behind your back them same folk will frown
But that's enough about them, talk about me
Yes, B to the O, I said B to the O
And to the B, I owe it to the streets
And I ain't trying to brag, but you know your boys a beast
And yeah I gotta eat cause my groceries on this beat
And my song will carry on 'til I no longer speak
My soul is also Kosher added to the fact I'm cheap
And I put that on my grandma, Othella, so rest in peace
Hater

Flight attendant woke me up said, "Mr Cole you have arrived, welcome"
In this game the price of fame is steep, Lord help 'em
Keep 'em sane, prayin' that the heat won't melt 'em
I'm headed to the top, I couldn't be more welcome
Took the lead role, now look I'm right outside your peephole
That's for the crown holders, never would I dethrone
But if you ever leave home, don't worry, I keep your seat warm
So yeah, I'm Simba in a sense, I'm the prince
You impostors no Mufasa's, but there's Oscars for you gents

[Freestyle - Toumi]
Four six twenty seventeen
The day the fingers hit the keys that are typing the rap you hear
I promise it'll also be the day the day this shit's released
I'm bout to go back to So Amazing and bruh, that shit is deep
I remember the day I decided to induct myself into the list of scribes that write a song where they die at the end
Two sessions, took nearly a full year to complete but I did it and now I'm about to go do it again. I hear

Made rappers trying to say that the new wave are too depressing who came up from an indie label, that's word to Jarren Benton
Nigga, you pushin' 40 with your eyes wide shut
I got love for you still but that's why the game is fucked

This ain't simply a test of Lyrics, flow and partners
I measure a person's worth by the depth of their hardship

That's word of Slug and a word I'm holding close to my heart
Next slug to whisper in my ear'll surely stop my hard working brain sending signals to the organ that propells love through my veins coz I'm
Sick of the pain

Sick of saying the next watershed to hit my page'll be blood
I ain't a Liar or a fighter, I was raised to be good. Yea
By two parents that love me and I don't wanna isolate anyone who ain't as lucky
But what can I say right now my world's beyond awkward. I'm fallin', I've fallen, I'm literally bawlin

And what is it that's gotten me this way?
Cherchez La Femme. But you won't find it in me. Simimarly, you'll never find me in that again
Time for the breakup tradition of getting yourself checked *spit*
Too much Venom in my blood so I spit it out and that's for your own good. We both know how this'd end if I aired it out on Facebook so finally I digress
Is it wrong have me to have mercy for the merciless?

It looks like my Dad's about to diagnosed with cancer
I've had to write this rap in one day just to give my fans a little something to make good on that last status. Got another tune to drop and I know it'll anger racists

And I ain't talkin' bout the faggots who were laughed out of my city for the third year runnin yesterday, tails between their legs
Bitch ass people. Fake ass "men" I won't miss your little "March" you ever try that again

Na, I'm talkin' bout the powers that be. Believe, I'm praying for london. I ain't religious but you see how it might look to a guy who's postered up in MI5, Failing to protect my country that a nigga has gone and dropped lines bout his first album being a bomb and twisting it back Next thing you know, I got 6 warning shots in my back

That's the plight of a true Master of Ceremonies. Eight years drumming experience, that's how I learned to spit in time before I even smelled a mic. But this is where I feel comfortable, it's what I like

But in case you can't tell, I'm finding little to comfort me right now, so comfort me right now. Retail therapy, how?

I can't even fall back on my friends this time. Like the real ones that messaged me when I published "I'm Fine"

Real niggas show their true colours all too quickly when they see that you're going all through a struggle
So please stay the fuck out of my bubble

There's a reason why a lot of my songs aren't easy listening
My pen game's at my best when these eyelashes are glistening

Toumi



English Translation

Amen
I Tell it to the sky mufucker  no lie
Amen Sucker
I tell it to myself mufucker no lie
Amen BITCH!!
I tell to the sky mufucker don't lie
Amen Sucker
Amen YO!
Thank God that I can live
Thank God that I can breathe
Thank God that I can spit
Thank God that I can dream
Even though this is beautiful I can see the world I remember
Even when someone is dying, they can still snore
I don’t know anything besides myself, yeah, whether I’m happy or sad
If you asked me if I would be born again as someone, I would choose myself
I can tell ya if I can’t attest to myself
After saerching through this one body I’ll spit on my grave
Fuck you this is my own god rappin’
Even if I can’t die a legend that’s okay cuz I’m my legend
Do you know the reality that there’s no shadow in the fire?
Then will I become the fire or will I become the light, that’s my question
So if I become the light then in the daylight, then the darkness
Closes his eyes when it’s bright and when others sleep, opens his eyes again
Even though I felt suffering I thank you
If there is a such thing as a God, I tell you

Yo, this is god rap
I don’t have any religion, because I am my own god
Whatever ordeals come, I’ll take them with my own two hands
And I say it to myself again, amen

Yo, this is god rap
I don’t have any religion, because I am my own god

And I say it to myself again, amen

Yo, this is god rap
I don’t have any religion, because I am my own god
Whatever ordeals come, I’ll take them with my own two hands
And I say it to myself again, amen

At one time I aspired to rap just like you
Everyone easily slanders and easily praises, like a hypocrite
Like that I wanted to bring cheer to my own reality
I’m barely an amateur, was I only a rapper?
While saying I’m different, while saying that my tastes aren’t cheap
I rejected almost everything. I thought that was cool
Then or now, the things I want are the same
At that time it was far from my eyes but now I can see myself
The thing that redeemed me too, the things that pushed into me
The distant precipice and everything, that’s all me
Foolish humanity, you too can become gods
Hold your head straight and try, a saint’s smile
Jesus’ footsteps, Allah’s prayers
Even until Maria’s love, all of it is inside you
This is unconditional redemption and unconditional belief
I am my god, my world, all my symbols

Yo, this is god rap
I don’t have any religion, because I am my own god
Whatever ordeals come, I’ll take them with my own two hands
And I say it to myself again, amen

Yo, this is god rap
I don’t have any religion, because I am my own god
Whatever ordeals come, I’ll take them with my own two hands
And I say it to myself again, amen

Yo, this is god rap
I don’t have any religion, because I am my own god
Whatever ordeals come, I’ll take them with my own two hands
And I say it to myself again, amen

HANGUL

Thank God that I can live

이 아름답고도 추악한 세상을 볼 수 있어
누군가 죽어가는 때도 코를 골 수 있어
나밖에 몰라, 그래 늘 기쁘거나 슬프거나
누구로 다시 태어나고 싶냐 하면 난 나를 골라
I can tell ya 내가 증명하지 못한다면
이 한 몸이 뒤진 후에 무덤에다 침을 뱉어
Fuck you this is my own god rappin’
난 die legend 못 돼도 돼 cuz I’m my legend
불엔 그림자가 없다는 사실을 너는 아니
그럼 불이 될 건지 빛이 될 건지. 그게 나의 question
난 불빛이 되리 또 낮엔 어둠이
환할 때 잠시 감고 남들 잘 때 다시 눈 뜨니
고통을 느낀단 것조차도 I thank you
만약 신이란 게 있다면 I tell you

Yo, this is god rap
종교 따위 없어 난 나의 신은 나이기에
어떤 시련이 오든지 난 두 손을 모으지
그리고 다시 내게 말해 Amen

Yo, this is god rap
종교 따위 없어 난 나의 신은 나이기에
어떤 시련이 오든지 난 두 손을 모으지
그리고 다시 내게 말해 Amen

한 땐 나도 그저 너 같은 랩 지망생
아무나 쉽게 헐뜯고 쉽게 추앙했지 사이비처럼
그런 식으로 내 현실을 위로하고 싶었겠지
난 겨우 아마추어 랩퍼였을 뿐이니
난 다르다며, 내 취향은 싸구려가 아니라며
거의 모두를 거부했지. 그게 멋인 줄 알았거든
예나 지금이나 믿음을 원하는 건 매한가지
그 땐 눈이 멀었지만 이젠 나는 나를 봤지
날 구원하는 것도, 날 밀어 넣는 적도
까마득한 절벽도 다 전부 다 나야
어리석은 중생아 너도 신이 될 수 있어
고개 똑바로 들고 지어봐 부처님의 미소
예수님의 걸음, 알라신의 기도
마리아의 사랑까지 모두 너의 안에 있어
이건 무조건적 구원과 무조건적인 신봉
나는 나의 신, 나의 세상. 내 모든 symbol

Yo, this is god rap
종교 따위 없어 난 나의 신은 나이기에
어떤 시련이 오든지 난 두 손을 모으지
그리고 다시 내게 말해 AMEN

Yo, this is god rap
종교 따위 없어 난 나의 신은 나이기에
어떤 시련이 오든지 난 두 손을 모으지

Would you love me, then it must be

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer
Uh, you niggas so last summer
On to the new, on-on to the new shit
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me
Two years later bitch we made it on, on to the Blueprint
Now how's that for persistence?
Cole World comin', call back up assistance
Same broads used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball
Put money over bitches, but we still underdogs

[Hook]
Did you miss me? No I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me (With me, with me)?
Up, up and away (And away, and away)
Hey, do you trust me (Trust me, trust me)?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me (Love me, love me)?
Then it must be (Must be, must be) a match made in heaven (Heaven, heaven)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
God's Gift, (Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)

Mothafucker this is God’s gift

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Pussy my passion
Man I just can’t help it I see a cookie, I grab one
Lookin' for some nookie, I’m tryna scoop me a bad one
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one
Ever since I got on
I’ve been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on
Ex-cheerleader, hollerin' what’s up
Now her nigga beat her, now that’s fucked up
What type of little fuck boy hit a
Woman, bet he wouldn’t put his hands on a nigga
Ha, I ain’t bitter boy that’s all you
Ha, plus I just fucked her fore she called you
Ha, dry your eyes baby, I’ll drive you home
Older hoes sayin' "My how you’ve grown"
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I’ll survive on my own

[Hook]
Did you miss me? I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me (With me, with me)?
Up, up and away (And away, and away)
Hey, do you trust me (Trust me, trust me)?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me (Love me, love me)?
Then it must be (Must be, must be) a match made in heaven (Heaven, heaven)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
God's Gift, (Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
Mothafucker this is God’s gift



[Verse]
Fuck it, aye
Do or Die, new arrival
Holla at my niggas
You survive you's alive, yo
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto
Money coming soon, the newest model
Your crew is hollow
The type of niggas gobble dick, chew and swallow
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts" uh
More sluts once the money blows up
But them hoes stop if the dough drops
I won't stop though, a chip off the ole' block
I'm from a city where niggas hold blocks
Leave you looking like old socks, damn
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us
The boys is rotten, I know they want us
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus
You kill a nigga, get promoted
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas
So much I just go nuts
Niggas telling me slow up
Never that
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at
Y'all don't hear me
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks, "
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo
They got streets in the city police won't even go
Peep it though, uh
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh
Niggas know my style though, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though
Have your daddy looking for you
This ain't Finding Nemo though
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, hey!
Hey, I'm just a Carolina nigga goin' hard for the 'Ville
I ain't seen six figures but I feel like a mill'
Cause I'm fresh up off the deal, will I chill? Never that!
I'm the hottest nigga out and you could tell the devil that
Got that crack! Went from pebble to that Roc, pedal that
So much bass, I mean niggas can't tell where the treble at
On the track, niggas can't keep up, they look, they trailin' back
Now these bustas couldn't catch up even if Id pedal back
Won't lose, bet on that! or be in debt forever
Plus whatever Jigga say, I'm hot
That's like the pot called kettle black
Now these industry niggas like damn, "Jay said all that? "
Same niggas could've signed me, now they gon regret all that
Bet on that! Bitch, this my beat, look how I get on that shit
I'm on it like I own it cus I sewn it
Needle and thread, hip-hop heads know them drums express youself
Aye look, I tried to school these niggas, they need extra help
I mean they just don't get the message dawg, no text could help
And now I'm on some 'fuck you niggas', go molest yourself
I'm tryna ball til I fall, catch myself, then ball again
Fall to the floor, dust myself, do it all again
Pardon him, sick nigga, never been a bitch nigga
Spit it for them ones like me who never been a rich nigga
Had the dream to make a team and get up off the bench nigga
You fuckin' with me, ya odds is slimma then a stick figure
Get bigga nigga

[Hook]
Hey, blood, sweat and tears, I paid my price
Hey, so come and get this good game
Aye you should come and get this good game
Hey, hey
I pray for days and nights I gave my life
Hey, so you can come and get this good game
Think you should come and get this good game
Hey heeyy

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm just a down south nigga, lil' east coast flow
From the concrete jungle where the trees don't grow
From the 'Ville, where the motherfuckin' streets so cold
Nigga I could show you streets where police won't go
We just tryna get a piece, my nigga we so po'
Why you lookin' at him, wonderin' why he sold dope
Or why she smoke crack? Or why he tote gats?
Gotta stay up on your toes cus if your feet both flat
A nigga heat gon' clap, your heartbeat go flat
The Lord giveth and he taketh, well he repo'ed that
They don't quiver, they don't shake, man they just reload gats
So much beef for a nigga to have a feast on that
Now a nigga like myself ain't had to keep no gat
But nowadays mo'fuckers is weak, won't scrap
So them OG's tell a nigga, "Please, roll strapped"
It's fucked up a nigga man it be's like that
It be's like that (Hey) and it be's like that (Hey)
Them boys from the 'Ville and yeah it be's like that

[Hook]



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit dropped I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing, big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13′s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game, but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth, most likely, uh
I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I’m gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet 'cause her mama always home
God damn, Lord have mercy
Please God, don’t let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy, 'cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I’ll pass, y’all Utah Jazz-in'
Ya borin’, I don’t play nigga, I’m Mark Madsen
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I’m not askin', my nigga I don’t need favors
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger
I fucking ran outta breath, heh
Team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger
Cole

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't even like this beat but fuck it, I'ma only spit a few bars 'cause I don't like this beat, let's go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, bitch I’m not old news, I’m more like gold shoes
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods
They say I’m old school, but I dropped out
Drop ya body off at a cops house
They throwin' up them bricks, you better box out
My niggas got enough white to build Barack house
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein
.44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans
I’ve been faded, stone wash jeans
New pussy, new money, New Orleans
50 up in that uzi, G-G-G, G-Unit
I murk you with that bitch, scratch the serial number, re-use it, uh
I’m from the N-O, stretch niggas out like limo’s
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples, uh
I’m bout to go banana puddin’, hehe
You a dyke 'cause your man a pussy
Hit you from the blindside, no Sandra Bullock
Never bite the hand that feeds you
Always watch the hand that’s cookin'
Tunechi

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Hahaha, yeah man, D4 Ho. Shout out Cole, you already know what it is, Cole World. Wayne’s World. We in this bitch ho, special delivery at your front door, hahahahahahaha, redbone biatch!



[Intro: David Ruffin]
Sometimes I think about it
And my poor heart wants to die about it
Woooooo about the sweet sweet love I lost
And the way I got double crossed
By a guy who was my friend, I see him now and then
But I pretend I'm doing fine, when I'm about to lose my mind

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast
Money fallin out my pockets I got too much cash
Can't fit nothin in her pockets she got too much ass like goddamn
Well if you must ask
We from the school of hard knocks but your crew cut class
Half white but don't think I got a Klu Klux pass
When I'm up in the V, police be fuckin with me
No sir no license all I got here is this fuckin degree
Move along cocksucker ain't nothin to see
Unless you talkin blockbusters, you niggas is not Russell
You more Diggy - me I'm more Biggie
No diss to the young boy im just rappin get bored quickly
Just to make up for that line invite him on tour with me
Show him the game let him finagle these whores with me
Run through they doors with me, hit the Ritz-Carlton for the night
Leave him there with two dykes probably change a nigga life right
What up Vanessa, I loved you that one semester
Thanks to my profession I balled like Uncle Fester
Thinkin about the board I use to have above the dresser
Half the shit I wrote down I did it, its old now got
New goals, plus my money on Manute Bol
Funny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows
Tired of every chick sayin she models before she swallow
So I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals

[Bridge]
Niggas keep askin me how I feel how ya feel
It's Coleee

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not even slightly interested in what ya opinion is
I gotta greater purpose then a hater purpose
I'mma stack paper, hustle just to relax later
Serve niggas and bring change that's a waiter's purpose
Look how I made em nervous, niggas is shakin, I know they fakin'
Okay you a killer right, and Miss Cleo is Jamaican
And Bob Marley is Haitian and me and Beyonce datin'
And Jesus Christ be hatin, got mad love from Satan
For fuckin Sanaa Lathan while Meagan Good is waitin'
I'm the deadbeat father of your little brother
In other words goddamnit I'm a bad motherfucker
It's Cole, it's only right I brought back the soul
Y'all got way too electro, damn near techno
Halfway homo, way too metro
Hennesy XO, Cole flow special
Style like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row
Learn somethin boy, grow yo ass up
Cheap nigga if you was liquor I'd probably throw yo ass up
Matter a fact if you was grass I'd probably mow yo ass up
Last call for you old niggas go and pour yo last cup

[Outro: J. Cole]
Yea, yea, yea yea, Cole World
This nigga Ib...he's a bitch
He told me to talk shit to you niggas, so I'mma talk my shit
Dreamville in the building
I know what y'all want me to talk about, what y'all want to me to discuss
But we'll get to that later; them bitch ass niggas...
My nigga Big Sean in the building
My nigga Canei on the beat



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Now I was dreaming 'bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiending for the mills, I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the Ville, all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spent they time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, I ain't hating, do your thing
I was like a young Simba; couldn’t wait to be the king
Now a nigga is the prince
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass, way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now it's time to eat, I’m letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me, now they acting like they know me

[Chorus]
Keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (Shit)
It ain't no telling (Huh, yeah)
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (Hey)
It ain't no telling (Yeah)
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (Going, nigga, ay)
It ain't no telling (Yeah)
Can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, uh

[Verse 2]
Pardon the interruption, a proper introduction is necessary
When your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn’t let me in the cafeteria'n
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians; they looking me up
She got to Jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning "J. Cole", they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin; six feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dollar and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I’m a star; Converses
Conversin' with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains
'Cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though, now they yelling—

[Chorus]
“Where you going, nigga?” (Shit)
It ain't no telling (Huh, yeah)
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (Shit)
It ain't no telling (Yeah)
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (Going, nigga)
It ain't no telling (Yeah)
I can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back
Told my niggas "Ay, I'm finna put the Ville on the map
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque."
'Cause I'm ill, bitch, they couldn’t make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send 'em back
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, if you slang, do your thing
Me, I'm like a young Simba; I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water, I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballers
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryna hit they daughters
Sneaking in her crib, but her momma never caught us
What they taught us?
Man, them bad bitches only want the ballers, the starters
We hooping, now the hoes wanna guard us
Uh, okay, so play D—know what I mean?
And I, I, I'll put you on the team
Man, this life is but a dream and I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport
I'm a fucking rap star

[Outro]
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (Shit)
It ain't no telling (Yeah)
They say this life is but a dream, well I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport
I'm a fucking rap star
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (Yeah)
It ain't no telling



[Intro]
Now do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?
Do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired? Yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm back on a mission to pay my tuition
Got loans out the ass, what you know 'bout my past?
I was so late for class, hit the probate, get trashed
Fell asleep off the Henny, back in '08, I crashed
With my foot on the gas, thank the Lord I'm still here
No insurance, so now I'm racin' home on first gear
On that morn' I shed tears, asking what I'm doing here
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she just jackin' me off
I needed more
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store
Put my feet on floor, borrow money from mi amor
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round

[Hook: J. Cole]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"

[Verse 2]
Ok my granny just died, but I'm too broke to go
And she asking my fears but she too close to know
Got trust issues I'm trying, where it come from? Don't know
I just block out the pain, blow the fuck up, get dough
See, I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out
My mama don't see me unless I'm on TV, I pray she (dont break down)
She strong, but she need me
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new things
She still a dime, but I always lose change
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains in a new Range
She tellin' me "So much has happened, would've thought you changed!"
We ain't fuck in nine months its safe to say I'm due man

[Hook]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me "Boy, you got your whole life to get old."
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"



[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
Elite Elite Elite, Elite
Ya know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym
Regular benchpressin' the bar
Ten steps up from ya'll, you could follow my lead
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Ya'll holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo, at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at LeBron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
A dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but nah, I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated
I let Elite breathe, yeah
Hey, uh uh uh
I let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey



[Intro]
Woop ! (Turn the lights on)
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (x2)

[Verse 1] J. Cole
Now I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rocking with the best mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed mane, let you play with the stick - Ovechkin
She calling, she texting, she’s falling, but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming offa my last name cause I really can’t take no stressing
'bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy”
But I’m signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing
Even here inside these walls, breaking each others hearts
And we don’t care cause we’re so

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 3] Ludacris
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
You gon make a player choose, show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session, let me show you a thang or two
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to your bare minimums
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whip cream
Then I'll put her on the back, get mean
Then I'll get her in a matrix, cut her like lasik
Basically make her scream
At the top f her lungs, give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death
Someone call in the ref', Ludacris is tired of playin
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that, you got everybody sayin

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 4]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even tho' I fell way

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 5]
And it hurts, cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even tho' I fell way

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Hook]
More liquor when we ride
Toast niggas, we alive
Golddiggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me? I’m in the front seat, driving like I’m 1 deep
If you want to come see, you know where I’m at
Go-getters on tha rise, toast niggas we've arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big thangs on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Get brains from a dime, how you love that?

[Verse 1]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now coming
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground running
I ain't never been the one for fourth down punting
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown hunting
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lockpick just to lock shit back
I want "Money, Power, Respect" since The Lox said that
Better stay up on ya toes, this is not tic tac
Yeah, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Balling like a Laker, you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peating
And I’m knee-deep in the game
It's quick sand and I keep sinking
The label heat seeking, nigga ain't sign me
What the fuck was he thinking?
They say I killed the game, that was only preseason

[Bridge]
I’m heavy
Lil' nigga I’m heavy
I’m so heavy, I’m feeling heavy
Carolina I’m heavy
In New York I’m heavy
Out in LA I’m heavy
I’m so heavy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No album to my name and I’m already hot
You can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling yours be seated
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in tha game bitch and you can retweet it
Email that shit, make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I'll be in the airport damn near barefoot
Security hollering out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I dont even be weeded
No point drinking I can’t even be faded
Real recognise real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late now it’s happy belated

[Outro]
I'm heavy
Nigga I'm heavy
Hey, I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga, in New York I'm heavy
Queens, I'm feeling heavy
Fayet-nam nigga, I'm so heavy
I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga I'm heavy



[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Bridge 1]
Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

[Verse 2]
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

[Bridge 2]
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say

And well that ain't my thing 'cause I

And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about that little kid
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
Nah, I don't wanna wait forever, sing

Hello, hello, hello (Up top)
Hello, hello, hello

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Cole World
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, back from the dead like Michael Jackson in red jackets
With naps in my head, who's white or black? It's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with these square rappers
My guest room's got plantinum plaques, and an air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you, word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought can occur to you
My next album flop, then I'm goin pop, like Nelly
With tops dropped on convertible Porsches
Born sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin', fightin' depression, I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it, I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear black nigga count stacks, count stacks

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket (You see it)
Another twenty on the way (You see it, ay)
I got a fist full of dollars (You see it, uh)
Five hundred for the Js (You see it, ay)
I get money out the ass (You see it)
I thought I'd never see the day (You see it, ay)
They put a price on my head (You see it)
But they won't ever have to pay (You see it, ay)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
Cause heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day

[Chorus: J Cole]
But for now I'm cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
Now get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Tell my story I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen, one day, hey

[Verse 2: Bas]
Yeah
Omission's usually, an admission to guilt
Hari Kari yourself, all the way to the hilt
You get nothin', no love
Zip, zero, zilch
We don't mention you lames, man I be pleadin' the fifth
There's a Judas in every crew, concealed in a kiss
Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits
Fucks sake you niggas emanate a feminines traits
Bitch nigga when could never relate
Nah, cause man you niggas is birds
You learn that at bird school, or somethin'
You eaten that bird food, or somethin'
You sick with that bird flu, or somethin'
That's my word, cause every where I turn
When folks I known for years, that couldn't pronounce my name
And asking me for pics, there's something bout this game
It's somethin' for the bitches, it's somethin' for the bitches

[Pre Chorus: J Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket (You see it)
Another twenty on the way (You see it, ay)
I got a fist full of dollars (You see it, uh)
Five hundred for the Js (You see it, ay)
I get money out the ass (You see it)
I thought I'd never see the day (You see it, ay)
They put a price on my head (You see it)
But they won't ever have to pay (You see it, ay)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
Cause heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day

[Chorus: J Cole]
But for now I'm cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
Now get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Tell my story I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen, one day, hey



[Intro]
Yeah (for her eyes)
For her eyes only (For her eyes)
For her eyes only, for her eyes only
(For her eyes, for her eyes)
For her eyes only

[Verse 1]
Yeah
For her eyes only to understand my perspective
It's all my fault that it all ended cause I choose to be overprotective
Damn, I'm nothing but reckless
I think, I understand why your momma don't wanna accept this
That necklace is so beautiful, hope your next nigga see that
He already know it's from me and he gonna question you "Why the fuck did you keep that?!"
But he don't need to know the reason why
Just know if he put his hands on you
That's gonna be the day that nigga die
I ain't gonna lie, I'm kinda scared that you might find the perfect guy
I mean, I'm gonna be happy for you but at the same time I'm gonna cry
That's gonna be the first time in history you ever see my ass high
Blow tree's til there's no more of me
I'm so fucked up but that's only for you to see
But don't be hard on yourself baby, cause I was already fucked up emotionally

[Hook]
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes, do you understand me?
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes, do you understand me?
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes, do you understand me?
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes only

[Verse 2]
Yeah
For her eyes only
Step on stage, a whole bunch of eyes are on me
Gonna tell the whole world what I feel about ya
Explain to them how I can't live without ya
Many friends, told me to go to therapy
That's the same shit they told me, when I was obsessed with Melany
It's a long story, please don't question me
Honestly, I know you fed up
Cause, you was happy with me
But all I could tell you is keep ya head up and smile for me
And no matter what baby please stay down for me
I know we ain't together but please come around for me
People do things for a reason
Like crack jokes just to be seen funny
Do illegal shit just to get money
But baby I wrote this song for your eyes only

[Hook]
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes, do you understand me?
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes, do you understand me?
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes, do you understand me?
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes only



[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one

[Verse 1]
Hey, uh
What up girl, tell me how you feelin’
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in
She said looks kill and I’m tryin to make a killin’
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami, with a super ho team
Tryin’ to bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name
Somethin’ like James, somethin like Wade
If you something like paid you can fuck tonight
Yeah she said fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings, won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money man the head is amazing

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one

[Verse 2]
What up girl, tell me how you been
Ain’t seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then
Thought you was a cutie, though your booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga, god damn
Hey now got a thing for you
It's been a long time comin', I should hang with you
'Cause see way back, I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy’s now, 2 and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah you still got it though
Girl your body lookin’ like a fuckin’ pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl you're on a roll
Do you get brains, did you make the honor roll
Don’t worry bout your man baby, he ain’t gotta know

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one

[Verse 3]
Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phoney, yeah only 'cause I can give you ends
Too late for turning back, fuck it we continuing
Get your ass in that position, I love to bend you in

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one



[Intro]
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom
Then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second
Watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's "Fuck the government!"
They see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 2]
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down
And showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics."
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better
For your kids before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 3]
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See, the people at the top
They get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla "Revolution!"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played
Then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution
Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said, what good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna
(High for hours, nigga)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go



Verse 1:

Dear Mr President
I wrote this, verse for you
I hope somehow you get play this shit and hear my view
I was chillin', sippin' texting all these girls up in my phone
Until my nigga hit my phone like...
Where you at dawg?
I got some shit i wanna share with you
Hurry up dawg
I pull through, he rolls one, we started talking 'bout you
Like, does this nigga even care about us
Cos if you black and you lack the cheese
You can't lurk in the burbs 'less you cut the green
Or your mama in the scene cleaning up their cribs
How you got the system setup
Be fuckin up my niggas 
When you tryna get your bread up
They come and clip your wings
They telling us we need education
So we wake up in the morning
And we oucthea paper chasing
And i ain't talking 'bout the cheddar
I'm talkin 'bout diploma, they say that paper better
They tell you that you better off with a paycheck
Push that 9 to 5 'til you old with your gray hair
First you start at the bottom theen you will get there
While them white boys
Man them bitches living life!
But fuck that cos i know we gon bounce back
My nighas in the ville with their faith on thread
All their dreams getting crashed
So they lean on the gat and they rob a nigha fast like gimme your whip!
Gimme your shit
If i didn't rap, I'd be banging up clips
Yeah, cos what's the worst that could happen
25 to life? Man that shit is a blessing
Cos you ain't gotta worry 'bout your next meal, or a crib, or the cream or your gear
All you gotta do is clique up!

(And i ain't saying this shit with no disrespect though)

(Chorus)

This the typa shit that makes me wanna let go
To all my nighas in the ville we gotta stay strong
Come together roll a joint
Let us chill then grind mode
If you hear me curse me a lot
Well....lemme see
Profanity is the only way i keep my sanity
I need my energy but i can never get it cos i hardly sleep, i hardly eat, i hardly ever get to focus on my shit

Verse 2:

Second verse? Yeah...

I need bread, dead president
I need stacks, dead president
I need more money than i could ima-gine...
Shit, look...

I could rap about this
And I could rap about that
Well I could rap about chicks
But I'm so deep in debt
That these chicks don't even look back and that hurts
So I am writing this verse with hopes that you'll hear it
I told my momma wait on me, please
Don't you desert me
I wanna buy whatever you want cos you deserve it
But shit, life is a bitch and i ain't fuckin
The motherfucken system ain't set-up to see me busting
While your motherfucken friends in cabin' are outchea ballin'
They fuckin up my tax money
With my dream honeys
While I'm beggin on the man
Not to cut me off the payroll
Thinking to myself
I need more than what I'm paid now
So i
Grab the mic and speak my thoughts
I'm in my zone
The beat goes on
I roll a joint
And loose myself
In my thoughts
Oh my god
Not these suicidal thoughts again
I'm high again
Imma need some Heineken
All i ever wanted was a whip and crib
A wife and kids, a car for the trips we take
And enough money just to buy the shit we need
But that dream, is becoming obsolete
I'm on a leash, I can never reach my peaks
But fuck that!
The hunger is got me going beast
I feast on beats, my pen juh glides, so imma get that...
(Yoooow, did you hear what i said?)
I said all i ever wanted was a whip and crib
A wife and kids, a car for the trips we take
And enough money just to buy the shit we need
But that dream, is becoming obsolete
I'm on a leash, I can never reach my peaks
But fuck that!
The hunger is got me going beast
I feast on beats, my pen juh glides, so imma get that...

(Chorus)
This the typa shit that makes me wanna let go
To all my nighas in the ville we gotta stay strong
Come together roll a joint
Let us chill then grind mode
If you hear me curse me a lot
Well....lemme see
Profanity is the only way i keep my sanity
I need my energy but i can never get it cos i hardly sleep, i hardly eat, i hardly ever get to focus on my shit



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something, or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Thug Life! Thug Life!

Visions of Gandhi Baldly Staring at me
They put his face on the money to show him smiling happy
Capitalism, I can't hold on for very long
So place your visions on paper i'm getting very shabby
Godly speaker, play messiah, Holy Swiggy, Pass a beaker, Place a order... Hallelujah to the very greedy
From the Back i Boo
They Say that i'm very wrong
My five senses of fuck you are going very strong
Touch my middle finger
Curse with my breath
The sight of a sinner, hear the footsteps of death
My heated arguments, make your book shelfs to melt
And in the pursuit of taste, serve yourself instead
You see i'm Brahmin, man i never heard a pistol
But my ancestors got the Pig Fat cartridges to bite into
Buddist Laws forbid you
You kinda miss the issue
The British came convinced you for the trade
They took your tissue
Like you
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves to your MRS
Food for though bitches
Everybody Slaves, we fall for those riches

[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself If I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell oh-well sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
Cuz plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top! You watching me nigga?
Then hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down

[Verse 2]
You were my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? yo, she still the baddest!
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down!

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down

[Verse 3]
And these are tough times baby but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A women with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know im down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down



[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh-huh

[Verse]
I'm I-95 cruising, the sun in my eyes
Headed south, dog, my mom ain't seen her son in awhile
Yea, I'll sure is

Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit
Yea, so nigga watch it!

You still up in the ville, tryna make it in the trap

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, this is the story of a young’n dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin’
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you’ve been gone
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diploma
Damn, gon’ be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I’m following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it’s me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don’t know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don’t give it up in the meantime

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Verse 3]
Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A’s
Hey if you’re listening we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z, aye what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays



[Intro]
This Honestly Speaking mayne
This how I feel (yeah), look

[Verse 1]
When my ex look at me, all she can do is smile
Cause all she see is greatness when she looking at me now
Just wishing she could go back, looking at all the Kodaks
But she know I'm moving on and her ass is just a throwback
Music all I'm focused on, tryna get my bread right
Kush all I'm blowin' on, just tryna get my head right
In the streets grindin' with me, tryna get it every night
Dodging the police, staying out of mind and out of sight
The 318 love me, they waiting on my music
Cause they know this lil nigga from Jonesboro finna do it
Just sit back, and take notes from a poet
You rip it, you sew it
I'm the hardest, can't ignore it
Tryna make it out the projects, and get my city poppin'
These niggas mad at me, but can't nobody stop me
Niggas dont want to admit it, but know that I'm the hottest
All the niggas steady doubt it, but the bitches know about me
It's death before dishonor
Loyal before royalty I keep it a hunnit
It's real niggas over here, there's way more than money
I'm the hottest lil nigga out of Louisiana
Not braggin' just being honest
Fuck all you niggas feelings, you losing, we winnin'
And we ain't even started yet, this is the beginnin'
I'm really from the streets, these niggas rapping just pretendin'
Flowin' like they hood, but really know they some bitches
Real recognize real, and I don't recognize you
But I bet all of you niggas gon' recognize Snupe
Real street niggas see me, all they do is salute
Cause they know these niggas lies, and they know I am the truth
Me and all my bad bitches kick it like we punt it
My chicks 'bout business, not the ones who be stuntin'
Them top notch chicks, not the ones that work at Sonic
I'm just laughing at you hoes cause minimum wage funny
I'm a true dream chaser, so I stay grindin'
I shine like a diamond, I guess it's just perfect timin'
People though I'd be in jail, or dead right now
But I'm rapping, dropping hits, chasing bread right now nigga

[Outro: DJ Ya Boy Earl]
And that's what ain't nobody gon' do better than us man, they not gon' out work us
Snupe, got North Louisiana on lock like a dark cell block, man
We gon' hold that down like a big girl with goodies, man
Ya Boy Earl, we in this thing man, Louisiana stand up, the whole state, lets go



[Intro]
Hey, the funkmaster flex is coming

Hey, hey look

Wake up, cuz gotta get your cake up

Man if you ain't hungry than thats just
More bread for me to bake up
Man if you ain't hungry man I'm trynna
Get my cake up
Look at the time, how could you think
Your shit is sicker than mine
Ask your homie as your girl ask your
Nigga then rhyme
This is andre mixed with Kanye mixed with Jigga then Nas
Couldn't name a bug with a buzz bigger than mine
Man I'm damn new homeless how Im picking up dimes
But nevermind that, look how I'm bringing these clever lines back
Nigga you whack, shoulda fired whoever signed that
Cole introduced you to death, you kept in contact
Jealous niggas, how many chances y'all blew?
How many times you been new?
All them advances y'all blew
Now you see me on the rise and throw a tantrum or two
Like "Dog i'm iller than him." Nigga im cancer than you
You barely catching the flu, now who is you?
Dead summer, you bout to tell a couple niggas lose your number
Cause Cole world coming, later for them bench warmers
Bitch I get covers you don't even get covered
No more stunting like kenevil though, I ain't evil even though
The flow is hella hot my pot is steaming for a reason hoe
Hiroshima flow, napalm, used to pray to god that funk flex
Would drop A-Bomb, man
Now he dropping like eight bombs
Anything possible, skinny jeans not a go
Raps go so deep they begin to seem nautical
Grade A, straight A, nigga go check the honor roll
Boy, hey lemme still get
Can I still get it flex?
Hey (On you) Hey (On you on you)
Hey (HOT 97)

[Verse 2]
I got a
Chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nugget
The industry overlooked me for that I'll be holding grudges
Wouldn't take a chance on me suddenly its oh you love it
Lets get a Cole feature, thats gon put you over budget now
Picture being broke without no pot to piss in and
Suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like god to me, slowly losing my religion as
These notes from my composition turn to compositions then
Put it out and let the world sing
(Yo hol' up hol' up hol' up)
We had dreams just to make it up the flagpole
Just to find out that your heroes was some assholes, Y'all don't feel me
Man look, hey y'all don't feel me (Lets get another one flex)
Hey y'all don't feel me
(I told you he was gonna do something else, lets get to something else, lets get to something else?)
Yes sir, whatchu got?
Hey, hey, hey, uh, uh (Chuckles)

[Verse 3: Blow tha Whistle]
Yeah, hey, New York (Oh my goodness, arrgh! arrgh!)
Hey, man, feast your eyes on a real nigga
Could never say it too much, im a ville nigga, (NICE)
Permission slips, if you wish I could field trip ya
Oh yeah you ill, while I heal, would you gill quicker
Told my brother when I get a little bigger Imma whoop your ass (Ha Ha!)
School of hard knocks, only outings with the class
So just in case a nigga trynna pull a fast one
When it come to these hoes, Im trynna pull a fast one
So when it come to questions she don't even ask none
I don't even remember the name of the last one
Wasn't this easy when a nigga didn't have nothing
Could't catch a break, now a nigga need a
Full body cast, throwing rappers into a body-bag
I do it just for kicks like I'm in karate class
Nigga mind on money stress, like he took pilates class
Cole finna blow with his old snotty, ass (Blow the whistle?)
Blow the whistle! (You know what is is, hot 97 Funk Flex J Cole)
Man blow the whistle (You want another one?)
Man whatever you got man, dog i'm ready for whatever (Let's go let's go let's go)

[Verse 4]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, man, look ok
Now that I'm blowing up, they money is slowing up
Them older hoes I used to know say "Oh you blowin up?
I remember when you was that tall" Ok now girl I'm this tall
And I'm ballin, I'm Chris Paul, they can't guard, and my whip dog
Look y'all, to my old hoes I miss y'all, how could I ever diss y'all
Hold but never kid yall, uh, I need someone who's gone be my baby
Not someone saying "What have you done for me lately?"
I took you out, I dug you out but oh that ain't enough?
You want my mind, you want my time but that ain't whats up
Time is money I can't afford that now, but girl you got the best range
And a smart ass mouth, So come here (BLOW THA WHISTLE!)
I really mean this, something like a genius
Ass so good, would have thought you made the deans list
Man we got it Flex, thats all they get boy (Ah, just, just curse who cares!)
Ha hah ha ha ha (Just curse who cares!)
Ahhhhhhhh
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)



Nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that don shit
Dom Pérignon shit
Not gon' cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling
Bout as sweet as a jumper on a gay Ray Allen
I’m bout fucking hoes like Ray J wilding
Killing niggas like KKK violence
I guess it why they pay homage
Momma I’ma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace



[Intro: Offset]
Uh, nobody, you know what I'm sayin', nobody, nobody thought a nigga would be right here, though, you know
That shit make like, that shit make, that shit make a difference in me and you
You was supposed to be here, nigga
Nigga, I wasn't 'posed to be in this motherfucker
Man, you know what I'm sayin'
Give all the glory to God and hard work
But you niggas gotta respect this shit, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm straight from the...

[Chorus: Offset]
Where I'm at? (Where) Where I go? (How) How did I get here? (How did I get here?)
Walk around with a Smithfield (Smithfield)
I'm from the south, had a gold grill (Gold grill)
Remember doin' shows in Mobile (Mobile)
Go against me and it's roadkill (Roadkill)
Wakin' up to see the sunrise (Sunrise)
I turned five, I got baptized (Baptized)
We was livin' up in College Park (College Park)
Midnight, heard the gunfight (Gunfight)
Playin' football at Forest Park (Forest Park)
Gresham Park where your moment get defined (Get defined)
The story of my life (The life)
Way before I ever wrote a rhyme (Way before)
Have you ever done time? (Time)
Lookin' at my kids through the blinds (Blinds)
Confinement mind (Confinement)
How you feelin' when you face a dime? (Time)
The truth be told (Told)
I'm supposed to be locked up and dead, cold (Cold)
In the mind of an old (He cold) white man, the black man soul

[Verse 1: Offset]
Felt like I was born on Mars (Mars)
Everybody starin' too hard (Starin')
They didn't really think I was a star (They didn't really)
Then I fucked around, beat the odds (Fucked around)
How did I get right here? (How did I?)
Neck, wrist on chandelier (Chandelier)
Made me wanna drop some tears (Tears)
Thankin' God that I switched gears (Whooo)
I'm from another lightyear, I'm a Martian (Martian)
One-third of a human, just partial (One third)
I'm the Sergeant, the Captain, the Marshal (Serge)
I start to barf, it was too much potion
Too fast, everything in slow motion
I get the cash and my money keep grossin' (Get the cash)
Popped a bottle, champagne, we toastin'
Suicide doors on the coupe when they open (Skrrt)
They didn't believe in me (Nah)
Check the stats, number one, you see (You see)
I bet my haters can't breathe
Nigga, don't even compare to me (Nah)
Street niggas, we rare, unique (We rare)
We can fuck 'em by the pair, by the three (By the pair)
Chopper soundin' like a snare in a beat (Like a snare)
I'm from the A, I love your ass, it's a peach (Peach)
Where I'm from, niggas cash, don't lease (Cash)
Where I'm from, the stick's on the backseat (Stick sticks)
Where I'm from, police put you six feet
A lot of bums and they sleepin' on the street (Bums)
Yeah, yeah, that's at home (Yeah)
Nigga, go back to your fam' where you dead wrong (Go back)
Miss my dawg, dead and gone (Miss him)
I can hear his voice telling me "Don't go alone" (Pistol)
Yeah, the money can't fix that (Nah)
Dirty money, had to rinse that (Dirty money)
I try my hardest not to look back (I try)
Not too long ago a nigga would've took that (Gimme that)
This for my niggas had to cook packs (Cook cook)
Million dollar trap fall 'cause of one rat (Rats)
Yeah, ain't no comin' back (Yeah)
How I made it out the jungle, yeah, without a scratch (Hey)

[Chorus: Offset]
Where I'm at? (Where) Where I go? (How) How did I get here? (How did I get here?)
Walk around with a Smithfield (Smithfield)

In the mind of an old (He cold) white man, the black man soul

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Baptized at First Baptist Church
The pastor name was Reverend Johnson (Okay)
Chastised his shirt and matchin' shoes
But had to front, it never bothered him (Okay)
Hurt his pride but he swallowed it (Okay)
Dirt is all that he spotted
And in the dirty south where bodies pilin' up
So high, they block the birds and rerouted 'em (Damn)
Plenty murderers had observers but
You never heard a peep out of them
So many funerals it ain't enough numerals to keep count of them (Woah)
Look, I'm just settin' the scene
Back when I stared at the phone as I'm lettin' it ring
Another collector, they leave us a message
My mama in deficit, must intervene
I bust out the seams, I'm gettin' too big for these britches now
I invest in the dream, I'm destined for green
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
And I think about that when I dig 'em out
(When I dig 'em out, when I dig 'em out)

[Chorus: Offset]
Where I'm at? (Where) Where I go? (How) How did I get here? (How did I get here?)
Walk around with a Smithfield (Smithfield)

[Intro]
What's love
Got to do, got to do with it? (Yeah)
I get a lil taste then I’m through with it
Then I send her right back to you with it (Ha ha), hey, how high?
(Hey) What's love (How high?)
Got to do, got to do with it? (How high?)
I get a lil taste then I’m through with it (How high?)
Yeah, I send her right back to you with it

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Visionary, play your position, no missionary
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope
Now picture that, my poetry’s deep, now fish for that
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail
Shit you gotta feel like it’s only read in braille
Both did the crime but his homie didn’t tell
So he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell
"Thinking well, what the hell I been on
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on
By the time I’m back in the streets like a bachelor
I gotta play the clubs with the old ass women"
Life is a movie, pick your own role
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole
You sit around crying, that's like sitting round dying
You wanna touch the sky? Bitch, you figure out flying

[Chorus]
Nigga, how high? So high that I could touch the sky
How sick? So sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees
How high? So high that I could touch the sky
How sick? So sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[Verse 2]
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels
Tryna get a nut with your girl, think I need to quit tryin'
‘Fore some nigga out there try to hit mine
Karma for the Kama Sutra
A lot calmer when the ganja’s through ya
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda
For stashing that marijuana
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed
I broke the law but look I’ll never smoke or steal again
In your courtroom wylin’, I don’t mean to keep smiling
But right now I’m high enough to probably steal a plane
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn’t read?
Would you throw the book at me
What if I’m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy
It’s been a long time coming
Tell my nigga roll me up something

[Chorus]
Nigga how high? so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[J. Cole ]
No I dont smoke, maybe once in a blue
When the tension gets thick then there’s nothing to do
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind
My eyes get shut but I open my mind

How high? la la la la
How high? hey hey hey
How high? yeah yeah yeah yeah
How high? la la la la

Is that a shot that you threw little man?
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned
Make it worse, your friends, now when they talk rap
All you hear is “J Cole this” and “J Cole that”
It must be hard for your pride just to take all that
I know your weak heart gotta break off that
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear
I’m burning you niggas and I’m only in first gear
I’m serving you niggas this is only the first beer
12 months from now, you’ll be having the worst year
No tears for the haters, I’m still counting money
Cole ain't dropping, thats real fucking funny
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps
Something like a mummy
But I’mma wake yo’ ass up
Something like your mommy on school day
I smoke two l’s with ya girl this is Cool J

How high?
How high?
How high? yeah
How high? yeah

Whats love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Yeah I send it right back to you with it



A coward dies a 1000 times
You on death 999
Fuck the world with an arch in her spine
All these artist the results left behind
Spit a rhyme and a corpse hit the ground
Listen close you could hear the loud
Thinkin deep as a mob
Getting throwed like a lob
This a 25/8 job
Could go 366 days
I could spit 366 ways
How can I see 100k making minimum wage
Bitter with rage , Free but I'm still in a cage
We still slaves
Went from being whipped and chained
To spending everything on whips and chains
Tell me when this shit gone change
Remember scraping up change and rubbing off stains
Watching uncles cook cocaine
At 14 cousin dong the samething
Cause don't shit in live come with a promise ring
If you ain't ready to lose you shouldn't play the fucking game

(hook)
Nigga get it how you live
From the same place so I feel how you feel
Different situations but we get it how we live
You ain't never struggle
You don't feel how we feel
Rags to riches the mission bitch we get it how we live
From the same place so I feel how you feel
Different situations but we get it how we live
Down here gotta get it how ya live

(Outro)
No such thing as justice in the 16th jurisdiction
You black you getting maxed thats truer than yo religions
Bitch its consequences when you thuggin, bussin



[Intro]
Yeah (Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa whoa-whoa whoa-whoa)
Yeah, yeah (Whoa, whoa-whoa)
Yeah, yeah (Whoa, whoa-whoa)
Yeah, yeah (Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa whoa-whoa whoa-whoa)
Yeah, yeah
Well, okay

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', throwin’ it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine, keep to myself, taking my time
Always into some bullshit, and out of line
Driving with my eyes closed, missing all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah
Man on a mission, figure it out
Putting way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes is gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (Smaller)
I've been gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the PA when I pull up (Pull up), soundin' like a concert
Or a, or a monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm falling up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
O-kay (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shame on you
And everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', throwin’ it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Bridge]
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it’s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt) feelings (Feelings)

[Verse 2]
Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm living I'm a little obsessed (Yes)
High in Jacuzzis I be hitting the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Blessed)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride
Why you lyin'? (Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth and step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shame on you
And everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', throwin’ it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Outro]
Hurt
Feelings



[Intro: The Hics]
Since I've let go of you and I
Lately I've been feeling too alive
Flying too close to the sun, yeah
Flying too close to the sun, yeah

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Oh yeah
Trees that grew between us
Tears that drip between us
Years have blew between us just to throw away
Might've lost our glory, but I love our story
Yeah I lock the door just to store it away

[Bridge: The Hics]
They say love don't cost a thing
Yeah right that's a underbid
They say love don't cost a thing
Oh yeah right that's a underbid
That's a underbid
That's a underbid
They say love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1: Bas]
And you know they be lying like Kellyanne Conway
I just get my thoughts off, I just take the top off
When the cauldron bubble, we come from the back block
So they call us trouble, we can never slouch nor stop off
Weekend on the couch with the socks off
Nah, we can make it count, run the clock off
We can count lives on the block lost
Cautionary tape, that we can never block off
All I see is hate, how many memories can a million make?
Opinionated, young nigga seen the whole world with my own two
What they gon' do with this young nigga?
Whole squad workin' on the same page like we one nigga
Like we one
I can't get jiggy with you clowns
I'm busy I've been giving New York City a whole new sound
Who really gon' hold this down? Who? Me, funny
I catch niggas gettin' sore when I do me
I still wish them niggas more than they do me
Gotta live up to the blessings of my Umi
Bring myself, couple steps closer to my God above
Never read the "Art of War" but it's hard to love
Never know when you go rollercoaster
All your highs got a low, rollercoaster
Bring myself, couple steps closer to my God above
Never read the "Art of War" but I could write the Art of Love

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Oh yeah
Trees that grew between us
Tears that drip between us
Years have blew between us just throw away
Might've lost our glory, but I love our story
Yeah I lock the door just to store it away

[Verse 2: Bas]
The inner me is tellin' me, "I gotta pace it"
The winner in me is tellin', "I got a bottle of Ace"
Cole gave me at the Garden from the case Hov sent him
Looked him in the face
Told 'em I can't pop it til sell it on my own occassion, bold claim
Told my momma I'd be back and I make it, both came true
Thought I was escapin', just to find myself right back in the Matrix, both pills blue
I thought I'd be fulfilled
I came from not a dollar in my momma basement
I came from baggin' product in my momma basement
Almost caught some shells tryna bust a couple sales
They went and caught a collar in my momma basement
I've been tryna keep her proud since, nigga way back
Got some niggas, keep me grounded, that's some way back
But I gotta take flights sometimes
These are fightin' times, I'm my only opponent
Somedays I'm betrayin' my holiest moments
I don't know who could control 'em
I don't know who could control 'em
I ain't living for me, I'm the youngest of five
And if I don't survive, I don't know who could console 'em
I don't know who could console 'em

[Outro: Bas]
Since I've let go of you and I
Lately I've been feeling too alive



Verse:

Hang on tight girl you going for the ride of yo life
Everything was fine until she said I wasn't her type
Oh I get it all the time its because that I'm white
She was like "nah I'm used to dudes packin' the pipe
So you can just drop me off if you ain't tappin' me right"
I hysterically laughed girl I ain't scared of yo ass

So when I get done with that you wanna marry me ha
Play in the backyard so I can bury the cash

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone
I ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere
My mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head
So Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

[Verse 3]
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'mma find a way, cause hey
Damn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way



[Intro]
Yeah, Hey, Warmup
Hey yeah
J. Cole, cause I got it yea
Hey warm up, yea hey uh yea
Cause I got it

[Verse 1]
I remember me and my niggas goin' hard on that BlackPlanet shit
Was finna go to college, need a BlackPlanet chick
While you was playin' hard like a BlackPlanet Crip
Talk that shit in real life I had to backhand a bitch
Remember back in '99 my favorite rap Canibus
Bomm Sheltuh was the shit, Nervous Reck and the clique
Put the battery in my back, gamme' the gat and the clip
Now these hoes want a nigga phone number and a dick
'Memba back in '98 that's when I first planned this shit
Watch when I hit the streets these new niggas can't exist
When ya'll was wearin' rap diapers I was tearin' down cyphers
This ain't no overnight I put in time like a lifer
'Memba back in middle school they used to think that I was hyper
Now I throw the Ritalin in my flow, get 'em hyper
Watch for vipers, that girl is a snake
He gon' wife her, shit
You know powder blue suit, white Nike her
Hey she that nigga leftovers
You the microwave
The bitch done seen more clubs than Tiger, (aye)
Get a driver plate, while he drive away
Yea you was almost fly but your flight delayed
A little late boy
Me and my niggas been eatin' off little plates boy
And yeah I'm hungry so trust me don't feel safe boy
This is Carolina's finest
I'm high without the marijuana, honest, I promise

[Hook]
Yeah, Fayettenam
Yea, you know that I got it
Yea you know man
I'm a sure shot right now homie, I got it

[Verse 2]
Ay 1996, my own room now, I'm hangin' posters up
Holes up in the wall my stepfather said I ain't supposed to
But I'm hoop dreamin', hangin up pictures of my idols
Jordan was like Jesus, SLAM was like the Bible
I used to read it twice and cut the pictures out
Had the Jordan free throw dunk tongue stickin' out
Focused tryna' figure out, should I leave it here or move it there
Even hung them shits on the ceiling
I had to use a chair
Cause I was only like eleven, ain't even had no pubic hair
Told my mama when I make the league I promise you a crib
And I meant it, was ill wit the pill
Real skinny nigga, you couldn't tell me I wasn't a little Penny nigga
Pictures of Reggie Miller, even David Robinson
Kobe with the half-fro Stackhouse and Iverson
Was all over, reflectin' my life, boy, you heard me
Top it off I throw on my Carolina jersey, fo' real

[Hook]
Nigga, I thought I was going To Carolina Nigga (I got it)
I coulda swore I was gunna be a Tarheel, Nigga, Dean Smith Nigga, You know?
It didn't take long though,Figured I'm not balling my nigga

[Verse 3]
Look I'm 13 now ain't shit the same
Yea nigga still hoopin' but the shit done changed
I got a new love, addicted to rhymin' it's like a new drug
Plus a nigga sick with it
I'm fuckin' whole crews up
And all hell, I started studying my idols
Pac was like Jesus, The Source was the Bible
I used to read it twice and cut the pictures out
I know my Mama wonderin', what the fuck is this about
Cause all that basketball shit on my wall was gone
Replaced it with pictures of some rappers with firearms
And plus a couple posters of bitches posing in thongs,﻿
You niggas was mowing lawns I was in here writing songs PUT ME ON
I just wanna be the best for real
I wasn't doing it for no money or no fuckin' girls
Back then I knew I was the nicest nigga in the Ville
Right now I feel like I'm the illest nigga in the world
The World world word

[Outro/Hook]



[Verse 1]
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left y'all browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say it's an arousing point of view
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shed truth
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ain't make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prision
You can tell I'm living, right?
Never said I'm living right

[Bridge: Cee-Lo sample]
I'm a fool
Such a fool
For you

[Hook: Cole]
And they like
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
And they like
And they like
And they like
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
And they like
And they like

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
The first to go to college, they say knowledge is a tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard, I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but I'm sad to say it
I ain't learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it
I'm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts, I don't bruise, so fuck y'all reviews
She told me "Cole, I love you rode with you way before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches
And calling brothas niggas, pardon if I cross a line
But all this time knew you was different than all them other niggas"
I responded to her "please don't put me on a pedestal
Cuz I know better and I'm still a fool"

[Bridge] + [Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, aye, aye, yeah
One two, one two, aye
Uh, uh, uh ,uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse]
Fast lane, living bad thang, giving brain from the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I'm high as god
Why is it lord that I can't seem to slow the whip down?
The same by standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don't follow rules
Call those blues, nigga hol' up, y'all still don't got a clue
All the cool niggas from highshools that still ain't doin' shit
'Member when you used to fuck niggas up 'til theblue and shit
Now yo ass broke as a joke and 'em niggas doin' it
It's funny how the tables turn in life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy unless they need a dollar
From his baby momma and you still don't wear a condom
Is you stupid nigga?
Fallin' in love with these hoes
Is you cupid nigga?
You better learn before you burn, boy
See me stay all top of my game, David Stern boy
Did his dirt like worms but my mind was more concerned with the future
Y'all niggas stuck in neutral
This the city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya
I'm here to get you higher baby, so this here's the booster
I'm tryna be the king nigga, this that Martin Luther, shit is crucial
Now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ville, still pourin' liquor for my niggas, killed yeah



[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...



[Intro: Mark Morrison]
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
Today is the day I get out on my feet
Remove them chains, they shackled on me
Press my luck, stop fucking with them hoes that cluck
Cause the same motherfuckers the ones that got me stuck
Tryna use me up ’til my tank on E
Then leave me stranded, scrambling in these streets
For a dollar a day until my pockets is straight
Soon as you move out the hood them niggas hollering you fake
Make ‘em swallow the bass from the Kicker
I’d rather be a dead man than a nigga
I’d rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
I gotta make moves, I can’t hang with ya
That used to be the fly shit back in ’95
But now I want a crib and a car I can drive
And ain’t nobody out there help me cause I’m grown
Gotta leave them childish games alone
Nigga I’m on

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I’m in the hood still praying for a piece of faith
I know he on his way I’m hoping he don’t make it late
I’m up the bat, I just hope I make it to the plate
I’m Babe Truth, you can tell ‘em I’m one of the greats
Used to shoot for the stars now my aim live
I’m the truth nigga something that your name not
A thousand watts ain't a thing that I can’t shine
It ain't a wrist or a chain that I can't rock
Tell ‘em I’m on something like city lights
I used to be out they sights, tinted like city nights
Now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
You can tell ‘em I put on for my city in plenty fights
Tell ‘em I ain't gon lose they heated like I’mma tan 'em
I’m bout to throw ‘em in this drop with no ceilings so I can fan ‘em
Pull up on the bike same color the Phantom
And jump out on them haters just to tell ‘em I couldn’t stand ‘em

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I’m on top of my game yo
The OG Grand daddy kush, cocaine flow
I’m about that cash not that tango
Head shots, dump a whole clip in ya Kangol
Claim to be a real nigga we know you ain't though
I be in the hood, all the places you can’t go
Visuals, you can see the pictures I paint yo
Residuals, I just put it all in the bank yo, it’s pitiful
Hoes only after your bankroll
Stay off of the phone, watch out for the plain clothes
Yeah I rep my set, I ain't in the gang though
I protect my neck I carry the thing yo
I’m on the same shit that the boss is on
Do it for those in the Feds, up North or gone
I’m on a winning streak, I done got my losses on
It’s ironic cause even when I’m off I’m on
Yeah I’m on, uhh, what?

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support, made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the ports the city of no remorse
Where they shooting back and forth like they playing horse
May the force be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed and I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve, damn I grieve with you
This a preview, I see you in the summer, my new shit dumber
I’m on

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Life at the bottom is devastating
You’re hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
By suckers that wanna be you and never live with the Matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated, anonymous then you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomited everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
Just wish them happy belated, fuck you I made it, I’m on

[Verse 6: B.o.B]
Tokyo, Amsterdam, Denver to LA
Minutes turn to hours and hours to pay
The days turn to nights but the nights never change
It’s funny time is money used to be a turn of phrase
But now it’s company policy
I’m no spokesperson, no tricks, no gimmicks, no coercion
And they say, "Bob, man it’s good to have you back"
But I say, "I've been here, where the fuck have y'all been at?"

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Thinking how Pac lived at 22
That's ’93, I was four now I'm 22 on tour
One, two shots of my life, barely hold on
But I’m drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
With mic’s on, lights on and they gon’ applaud
Young nigga, Versace they never seen before
And they gon' watch me, copy shit that I got on
I’m too fly, I ain't got a flaw
Tell the law we above the law, God bless, amen every lost soul
And the group so good, went solo
Globe trotting, now I’m blowing up like an afro
Nigga thought you knew what I do
Rolling through ya area, double R coupe
Penthouse level now we only party on the roof
Bitch I’m a rebel so I move how I wanna move
Last King, YMCMB

[Verse 8: Gudda Gudda]
Used to run around the hood picking honies up
Now I’m doing shows around the world picking money up
Used to be slept on like a pillow
Went from trapping in a rental to rapping on instrumentals
Now its money on my mental and women get sentimental, huh
It’s cause the flow is sweet as a pack of skittles, nah
Yellow gold, yellow diamonds in the middle, nah
Stand up nigga, I was never known to sit down

[Verse 9: Bun B]
Well as the world spins around and around on its axis
Boys flip from town to town with the package
Stuffing bills and pounds and browns in a mattress
Sending clowns underground for practice
The fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown
But never in the battle when the drama goes down
Easy to be the boss from behind the wall
But we gon see who really goes down when it’s time to brawl
Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying
You gotta show love to where you from all day
And when the going gets rough, don't get to going, get to staying
Put it down for your people and no delaying, know what I’m saying?

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on



Yeah, my God, Syience

[Hook]
Lord I've been dreaming about the paper

Ain't making it rain though

But if you feeling it, you can take it all and show me
Don't fight the feeling mama
Not Jeffrey Dahmer but your body is a killer mama
I'm tryna rock that ass to sleep like pyjamas

I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
My palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
Haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good
I live my life like you should cause

[Hook]
Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it
Get on my level boy I'm hot like I've been dancing with the devil man

So in case you ain't heard, observe

[Verse 2]

And I'm back with that flame, I got that flow that'll blow your brain
They calling me Cole yeah that's my name
And just like Martin I know that pain
No novacaine and won't complain never
But spit it so hot whenever I drop a verse I change weather
Now hey badder I'm dropping that Floyd Mayweather or Lebron James
Rather so much better than these featherweight rappers I'm ahead of my time
And never pressing rewind
Now watch me shine

I'mma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
My palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
Haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good

[Intro]
He gonna have the nerve to fucking tell me niggas from the south can’t spit?

Stupid ass mother fuckers (New York, what up? Queens)

I'ma show you all stupid ass motherfuckers (Coming soon, nigga)
Dumb ass niggas

[Verse 1]
The heir to the throne
South nigga bred to the bone
But haters say he fled from his home (please)
Now picture that, I was 18 with million dollar dreams (yeah)
Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akeem
But ain’t looking for no queen, (nah)
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup)
City on my back, I just lift my wings, I’m fly
You niggas on my dick, why lie?
Thought them niggas from the south couldn’t spit, violá
I’m here. humble out of respect, not fear
So please be clear, nigga please beware
I’m a motherfucking monster, B.S. me? (naw)
No, my hand game like fucking PSP
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon
My dick do the damn thing, honey it’s cumming soon
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (yea)
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave
Rest In Peace, ya’ll boys living too fast
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash
Ville niggas don’t play
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won’t spray?
Mid-day when it’s sunny, they kill niggas broad day
On some old new jack shit
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run

[Hook]
Ha ha ah
I’m the man, ha ha ha, yea hey
I’m the man
I’m the man, (I told ya’ll niggas)
I’m the man

[Verse 2]
Yea, uh
They say I act like I’m the man, 'cause motherfucker I am
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams
Damn boy I'm so flamboyant with the ensemble
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo
And I’m the man, now understand a nigga bossin’, (yea)
Scheming on that drop top CL but it’s costing (yea)
Long term plans for the fam, we’ll be golfing
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless i’m flossing (woo)
In the streets niggas peaceful until you force em'
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss ‘em
Goddamn you niggas got handled
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for ‘em
I know who did it, but you think I’m finna squeal on him?
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him
That’s word, nigga observe my genius
E&J sipping got a nigga straight leaning
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking, (haha)
I told y’all I’m the man, what the fuck ya’ll niggas thinking?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yea
First and foremost, Fayettenam what’s good?
Carolina, what up? Bull city, Raleigh, Charlotte, Salem

Y’all niggas still see me tho, you think I’m still there; you ain’t even know I’m gone
Back so much, nigga

Prince of the city, nigga
Prince of the south, nigga, holla at me
Ya know? Heir to the throne, bitch

All my niggas high as hell and blunted
Bought my bitch the YSL she wanted
Nigga, Mom Dukes wanna trip to Dubai
I'ma get her everything she wanted
I'ma do this shit the way I wanna
Cube hard to them California days
Remember hoes I had to motivate, now they see Sun, like the water breakin'
They get to count my dough but you got your own, you the star of the show
We do it big, goin' hard on the road, but you got my heart on a rope
You invaded my conscience, I'm a dog, but not much of a bark
You smart, you takin' precautions, shit, I knew from the start

[Chorus: Correy C]
This for all time, you can't blame the summer, girl
Get your head right
This for all the time, you can't blame the summer, girl
Get your head right
Oh, girl, you gotta get your head right (girl)

I'm drivin', nigga as soon as I get the text we all in the car like, "Ahh, yeah nigga, we out here nigga, yeah nigga!!" So we goin' crazy, we goin' crazy as fuck, we like super excited. Dog, ten seconds later, all I see in the back and hear is "woop woop," blue lights right behind me, the fuckin' undercover car, of all things. So I'm like fuck. I knew right away what it was. Dawg, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New York, I was drivin' dirty, my license was no good. Dawg, how 'bout the moment I found out I was gon' get the deal a fuckin' cop got behind me and I already knew what it was. I handled it so like, I handled it the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin', bitch like, ah know what I'm sayin'? I'm in there dog, spendin' the night in jail realizin', like, these niggas have no clue, bitch I'm 'bout to sign this shit (laughs). That was the easiest night in jail a nigga could ever do, son



[Intro]
I need to know, how many people out here tonight, Fayetteville, have been fuckin' with me from day 1 I need to know
I'm talkin' 'bout when a nigga was passin' his mixtape out the fuckin' mall and shit
He like, "you passed me one, nigga"
I'ma do this shit ion' care if there's only like 5 or 6 people in here that know this shit I don't give a fuck
I'ma do this song for anybody out here tonight that got this shit that I dropped called The Warm Up you know what I mean you gon' fuck with this shit
Or even if you got this shit that I dropped called Friday Night Lights, you gon' fuck with this shit
Now listen, I know a lot of people here, been fuckin' with me for a long time
But a lot of ya'll, you know this might be the first album you fuck with, or the first show you ever came to so I gotta set the scene for ya'll, I gotta let y'all know somethin'
This shit been a long journey it was not always like this
It was not this many people
I'm bout to take ya'll to a time
Way before we had these fuckin' fancy ass fuckin' LED lights and shit
I don't even know what the fuck LED lights mean, but I'm payin' for them bitches
Way before we had this fuckin' cool ass stage and shit, we ain't had to shit like this
And definitely way before we had this stupid fuckin' ridiculous, expensive, blue for no fuckin' reason video wall behind me
We ain't have no shit like this man
The only thing we had- the only thing we had was classic shit like this

[Intro to Lights Please]

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sing!

[Verse 1]
I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on Bragg boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please

[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please
Sing!
Turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Intro to In The Morning]

Ah shit
2,6 sing
Hey can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'
Huh, up top!

[Verse 1]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Ay would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Sing
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', moanin', moan...

[Intro to Nobody's Perfect]

[Intro]
Hey!
Cole world
Fayettenam sing this shit!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is for all the fans...
[Crowd]
That waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
[Verse 1]
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like- Hands up!
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing
Sing!

[Chorus: Missy Elliott, J. Cole and Crows]
Nobody's perfect, sing!
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Say what?
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, right side, hands up
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh



BET.com: You got some backlash for anti-gay lyrics and you gave a statement to the Huffington Post. Do you regret using the word “f*****”?

J. Cole: No, not at all. It’s much different than the autism thing, it wasn’t conscious; that was a slip-up, being offensive without intent. The line was to engage the conversation of homophobia in Black culture and in hip hop. I thought it was going to be a way more interesting conversation that came from it. Of course I made the statement, but I thought from that it would spawn better conversations like, “Why are we so homophobic?” Much more than I think any other culture, I don’t want to just compare it to white people, but in terms of jokes that you make — everything’s got to be “pause” or “no homo.” You can't even play basketball without someone saying, “pause.” I’m not innocent of it. I am part of that same culture – but why? That line was supposed to be offensive and confusing, but I was hoping to have more conversations about it.

BET.com: There’s been a lot of conversation about the Trayvon Martin tragedy and what young Black men experience. Do you experience racism?

J. Cole: For sure, absolutely, I just got pulled over on 42nd street in Times Square for what I believe was nothing. They said it was for tints on my front window, which is barely tinted. I really believe it was because I had my hat low. I was driving through Times Square and I just didn’t want to be seen. So I had my hat low and I think I was looking “suspicious” just as a Black man with my brim low, when I was really just trying to cover my face. They came to my window, pulled me over. I feel like if I was a white man driving, they wouldn’t question me about my tints. They told me to roll down my back window; they look in my car as if they’re looking for something. I feel like that was the real thing, they were trying to catch somebody slipping. That just happened three days ago. I almost didn’t even name that because I am so used to that. That’s something that I feel like somebody my age that’s white doesn’t have to go through, especially in New York City. On the other hand, every time I’m on the plane in first class — this is a lesser evil but it still represents their mind state — I promise you, 60 percent of the time somebody asks me what basketball team do I play for or do I rap. [Laughs] I am a rapper, I wish I could tell them something better — that happens all the time and I hate it. I hate that we’re stereotyped and I hate that I’m fitting into the same stereotype.

BET.com: You’ve talked about including dark-skinned women in your music videos versus all light-skinned women. The light-skinned, dark-skinned issue certainly affects women in hip hop; does it affect men in hip hop?

J. Cole: I can’t say it for sure but I just think we’re still in America. We’re still Black Americans. Those mental chains are still in us. That brainwashing that tells us that light skin is better, it’s subconsciously in us, whether we know it or not… still pursuing light skin women. There are some women out there that are like, “I don’t even like light skin men” and that’s fine. But Barack Obama would not be President if he were dark skin. You know what I mean? That’s just the truth. I might not be as successful as I am now if I was dark skin. I’m not saying that for sure, I’m still as talented as I am and Obama is still as smart as he is, but it’s just a sad truth… I don’t even know if this is going to translate well into text and people not hearing what I’m saying, but it’s a sad reality. So I can only naturally assume it’s probably easier for a light skin male rapper than it might be for a dark skin male rapper. It’s all subconscious s***, nobody’s aware — I think that s*** still subconsciously affects us.



[Intro]
Naw, I'm just saying like, I'm just trynna see you, you know what I'm saying? What you was doing after this
Naw, I stay not too far from here, like right down the street-yea like right there

[Verse 1]
Baby you summertime fine
I'll let you get on top, I'll be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason only time could tell, but well
I'm wondering what type of shit you on
Do you like the finer things or are you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed?
Done be ashamed, it ain't no thang, I used to blow trees
Getting lifted
I quit the shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower you, a powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibes
Like you threw something to me-so I threw em back
Now all my niggas hollering "who is that?
Oh boy she bad nigga, what you bout to do with that?"
I'm finna take you home sip a little Patron now we zoning
Baby you so fine

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 2]
Yea, yea now are you shy or is you freaky lady?
Are you shallow cause if not I'll take it deeper baby
Tell me what turns you on
You like the slow songs?
You like some candles lite?
That ain't really my style
But see I planned a trip
And yea we both coming
Just tell me how you want it
I give it to you like I owe you something
When I'm on it, on it like my job
I'm hoping I confess
This life gets hard I can take away your stress if you let me
You knew just what this was when you met me
So let your guard down girl
I'll take your bra down girl and undress ya
Real slow yea I'll make you feel special
I can feel your heart beating fast
From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab
And now ya leaking, freaking ain't no speaking but you moaning!
Ya so fine I got to give it to you

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 3]
I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning
Do you like caressing or do you like aggression?
You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows
Do you want it in the dark or while the lights is still on?
I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel
While we sweating you dripping wet from what your body spill
Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go
See baby lately seems my life been hell and heaven knows
That you looking like an angel-sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle
Got a nigga tangle in your spider web
I'm doing shit I never might of did
And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red
Your body's right as rain
So where the hydroplane
That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame
Thank God I found you
Just holla when you want it
Cause girl your so thorough



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the Sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah



Yeah
Still at it
Villematic
What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hellbound
With these flows, Cole
And when my story's told
Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow
So, I'm coming for what I'm owed
You know?

[Verse]
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be



Can someone please turn off my mind?
My thoughts are racing all the time
There is no reason or no rhyme
I'm trapped inside myself

A newborn baby has two primary modes of communication
Laughter, which says, "I love this"
Or crying, which says, "This frightens me, I'm in pain"
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

At the bottom of the hourglass
Lies sand that represents the past
In which all of my demons rest
I'm calling out for help

There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
K-O-D



[Verse]
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be (Hey)
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go

To look behind and say, "Look where I came"

And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be



[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the story of a young man who left everyone and everything he loved to chase his dream. A lil' nigga from North Carolina, Fayetnam to be exact. Packed up all his shit and moved to the big city of dreams, where he ain't know a motherfuckin' soul, and he ain't have a motherfuckin' thing, just a dollar and a dream.

This mixtape is provided partly in part by, Dreamville Records. Straight out the Ville where anything's possible. All-terrain music, that's Carolina's finest boy. And by any means, when ain't shit handed to you, you gotta take it. Without further ado ladies and gentlemen I proudly present to you, J. Cole, The Come Up.



[Intro]
Yeah
You ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith and all that
But sometimes
Sometimes you second guess yourself
That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it?
Warm Up



[Intro: Ceerock]
One million dollars ain't enough to make u rich
Cause 1st off all u need love to be rich
So, a million dollars ain't enough to make u rich

[Verse 1: Ceerock]
Entao , eu estava por ai na Cidade de Maputo
A ir por a conversa em dia com o meu puto
E no caminho cruzei com a minha Ex Nia
Ela ja toca nessas bandas , mas quem diria
Depois lembrei me do que entre nos dois aconteceu
Relacao ja esta morta , mas o amor nunca morreu
Porque a separacao ? Nenhum gajo entendeu
Ainda querem explicacao ? Todo gajo ja esqueceu
Entao contei que cruzei com a Nia ao meu ngga
Oque ela fazia ali eu juro que nao sabia
Ya , costumo lhe ver e quase sempre me lembro
Quando tu dizias que ela ia bazar com o vento
Sim , ela era minha e eu tratava tipo rainha
Oque nos atrapalhava eram suas amiguinhas
Eu fiz de tudo pra ela nao seguir as amiguinhas
Que gostam de ir com o vento , por isso so usam sainhas . Go

[Hook: Ceenarci]
Tu nao precisas de ir com o vento
Porque ainda ha um tempo
Para haver um recomeco
Miuda me escuta , eu te peco 2X

[Verse 2: Ceerock]
A Nia me via como um desmancha-prazer
Mas tudo  que eu fazia era dar-lhe prazer
E ela recebia chamadas no meio do nosso lazer
Prejuizo para minha pita as bradas estavam a trazer
Sempre entravam mensagens , tipo girl quale a cena
Nem sei porque perguntavam , se a ideia era sempre a mesma
Depois de um tempo comecei a ver isso como um problema
Mas a ma influencia era o verdadeiro problema
Porque essas pitas estao perdidas , so vadiam nas esquinas
Nao era o destino que eu queria para a minha Nia
Entao sempre falei , eu sempre avisei
Mas ela escolheu essa vida entao ngga respeitei
Ja nao tava a dar , decidi me afastar
Porque so perco tempo a tentar lhe ajudar
Eu sei que um dia a Nia vai de mim se lembrar
Quando essa vidinha que levam acabar mal
Nao e' rogar praga , no , e' realidade
Que um dia vai se dar mal e' uma pura verdade
Isso acontece com muitas miudas dessa idade
Irem com o vento e fingirem uma personalidade
Diferente do que tem , mas assim nao vao alem
Melhor caminho certo de um , do que errado de uns cem
Mas antes de ir , repeti oque sempre disse a Nia
Talvez voces nao sabem , mas eu sempre lhe dizia ( listen ) :

[Hook: Ceenarci]
Tu nao precisas de ir com o vento
Porque ainda ha um tempo
Para haver um recomeco
Miuda me escuta , eu te peco 2X

[Verse 3: Ceerock]
Antes da musica acabar uma coisa aconselho
Deves tentar ser mais forte que a forca do vento
Nao sigas os passos daqueles que so te fazem perder tempo
E pra decidires o teu caminho tu nao podes ser lento
As mas influencias hoje estao por todo lado
Trata de te tratar e ficar so no teu canto
Por mais que certa cena seja mais que um encanto
Tu deves ficar atento ou seras prejudicado
Nessa vida toda gente tem o seu destino
Tu deves saber ver bem quale o teu caminho
Nao vas por um camimho so porque muitos estao a ir
Porque nao sabesa razao dessa gente estar a ir ( do you feel me )



[Intro]
Yeah, The Warm Up
Lemme stretch out
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They say I'm the down south Nas, the east coast Pac
The Carolina Andre, the Fayettenam Kanye
So join it, can't beat it, to all the nonbelievers
If you missed it, I'll repeat it, I'm the light skinned Jesus
Here's my thesis for them niggas with them pieces like Reese's
We ballin' while we winking at your bitch up in the bleachers
She fiending just to hop up on my shit like she was featured
On that piece of shit, bed keep on squeaking like some sneakers
On the court, here's some lines you can snort, food for thought
Here's a fork, no pork, damn it, keep it pure, organic
What's the score? Lord, it's a blowout
You niggas out here shoutin', but see me, I'm just gon' show out
Bitch, it's destiny, no doubt, niggas testing me more but I'm sure
Look homie I know my shit can give a tour of the sewer
I'm bored, this shit is simple, on instrumentals I'm Kimbo
Slicing on any tempo, I'm busting like many pimples on the temple
Go hard like I just seen some nipples on Beyonce
No disrespect to Hov, but if I didn't I'd be beyond gay
Almost erased them lines but in the end I chose to keep 'em
'Cause if I said it, I really, I really
I really mean it, yeah

[Interlude]
And that's just a Warm Up baby
Lemme give it to 'em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, nigga

[Verse 2]
I rep my city in your city
Just to let you niggas know just where I'm comin from
Ville' nigga troublesome
Gats all around niggas waist like a cummerbund
Leave you leakin' 'til the plumber come
Still we ain't running from no man
Look bitch I'm hot enough to melt a snowman
Ey pack your bags mama we gettin the fuck up outta Po' land
Cause I'm programmed for the dough
While you hold hands with a ho
You ain't got no chance when I flow
Bitch I was a grown man when I was four
Boy, so sit your ass down
You lookin at the class clown
Slash valedictorian, slash hoopin nigga best dressed
Back in school you was just a stupid nigga
And now you're rappin all you talk bout your Coupe is sicker
Your top is dropped but the cops is out here shootin niggas
Stupid nigga, see me I rather tell the truth to niggas
You out here stuntin, niggas is out here frontin
Nigga you good for nothin
I'm freestylin coming off the dome
Bitch Macaulay Culkin Home Alone
I don't even know why I said that
And bitch I get bread that's enormous
Ya'll niggas on my dick man I'm dormant
That means I'm on the low, that means I'm on your ho
That means I'm about this dough
Nigga I'm coming off the dome
Bitch I'm I'll all the way to the chromosomes in my body
Bitch get hit with a 12-gauge shotty
No Maserati, driving like Mr Cosby
Nigga know
I'm coming through I got the sicker flow
I've hit them motherfuckin niggas with that
Nigga know that drunk shit I'll shit
Comin through I spill shit like whoops, bitch
You need to read a book bitch

(Fade Out with J. Cole still rapping)



[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Art of seduction, hoes jump like Vince Carter
Backstage like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams, you gotta start off with something
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustling
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said "Your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin' on
Funny 'cause I only know a couple of your songs but I love when they come on"
Word?

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted
[mumbling]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?

[Verse 2]
That's a little ego—
Tistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G 'cause he know
Bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass
Into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich, huh
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick, huh
She thinking she got a first round pick, huh
She thinking 'bout all the things she can get, huh
She thinking you got a Range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple 'cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches
And they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word
Wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs
Aye

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted
[mumbling]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?



[Intro]

Niggas been knockin' them down before the fame shit you feel me
Ain't nuffin left
Certified side nigga shit

Yeah
Is she gon' pop though

[Verse 1: TruRebel Migs]

Pardon me your time
Don't mean to part time ya
You see a part of me
Could hardly see
Beyond your hind parts
And she probably got a heart that bleed
But before Cupid put a dart in me
Shit
Cards I gotta see
Is she a Queen?
I ain't no joker
I ain't gon' front, I'm tryna poke her
See I ain't gotta lie to her to lie with her
Her man be lying hiding shit
She know what time it is
Just slide your line
We gon' catch this vibe
We gon' be alright
I just might
Get up in your mind
Give me brain, with that soul food
I could be your side
We gon' slide when your nigga slippin' on his job
Working 9-5
I could be your 5-9
Shawty said she want a real one
She got a man, she tryna build suntin
She got 100 niggas feelin' her
You keep it real and they gon' still front
Cuz see she got options and
He got options and
I got options but
I wanna fuck witchu
Tell me the move
Say what it do
Either way you gon' pick and choose

[Verse 2: Jay Prezi]

Werd
Listen sweetheart
You lookin' like you taste just like a Sweet Tart
If I go down
Have you thinkin' Im a retard
Excuse if I come off rude
I know you want a dude
To take you out and buy you bags and shoes
You could keep him
Just when you leakin'
Call me for the freakin'
He could have the weekdays
You could call me on the weekend
I play my part like Will
So what's the deal?
Bad boy
This Prince been Fresh since uncle Phil
I am legend baby
Just promise you won't go crazy
Afterwords don't get lazy
We just get up and go
I promise you gon' be happy baby girl I'm a pro
I just thought I keep it real from the jump
So baby what do you want?

[Verse 3: Bale]

Never brush you off
But I would like you sweep ya
You wear that Dior, it compliment your features
She love to call me cocky but that’s apart of my demeanor
Can we Talk for a minute
I know your past washed say it’s time to rinse it
But you ain’t looking for another soft commitment
I know feel like love when I fall up in it
She blew a nigga mind like a Dodger fitted
I write stories about my life make a small appearance
Clinging on my words like charming terrific
I know the shit that you hear got you all defensive

(Skit)
Boy stop playin' with me
I bet you tell this same ass shit to every girl

We getting personal
I don’t do impersonations
This ain’t a lack of effort
I’ve just focused lately
Ain’t tryna Screw you down
Maybe screw around
Run around the city
Get a check oh that's Nike town
I can’t polish your potential
Let me just whip you down
Have some patience with a nigga
I'm Just tryna figure out
We one the same page
Is you gone pop it now?
You gone pop it now?



(Verse 1 Notorious BIG)
A nigga never been as broke as me – I like that
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt I'm sewing tigers on my shirts
And alligators I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position
Here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin'
Here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them I mean loyalty

(Hook)
I'm trying to look for somebody that the ride with me tell me is that you
Tryna find somebody not gonna lie to me tell me is that you
I been looking for someone to hold me down is that you
Baby tell me is that you, is that you
Baby tell me is that you, is that you
Baby tell me is that you, is that you
Is that you, is that you

(Verse 2 J Cole)
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes  in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
It's beauty in the struggle
Ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and thought some times we had less, Compared to some of my niggas down the block  Man
We were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
Cause all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?

(Hook)
I'm trying to look for somebody that the ride with me tell me is that you
Tryna find somebody not gonna lie to me tell me is that you
I been looking for someone to hold me down is that you
Baby tell me is that you, is that you
Baby tell me is that you, is that you
Baby tell me is that you, is that you
Is that you, is that you



Hands in the air (4X)

(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

(Bridge 1:Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spit  at you, spit it great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because

(Hook:  Marsha Ambrosius)
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

(Verse 1: Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta
Trust in God and hustle hard
My grind is real, my hustle dope
I’m finding meals, I’m signing deals
I’m the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it’s real, but I’m focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you’re not in tune, no, you’re not immune
No Echinacea, no golden seal
So you sick inside, gotta flush it down
When you talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain’t nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you’re out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you’re gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That clock only thing you punchin' out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you’re made to do
I got faith in you, you’re gonna make it through
Cause you don’t chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a baby due
You won’t taste no fruits like Naked Juice
Wo!! The world won't wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vow
As long as you on planet earth put family first got to make 'em proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are

(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

(Bridge 2:  Marsha Ambrosius)
Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I’m hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids up at the school
Life it’s hard, yeah, that’s true
This is what I have to do

(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

(Verse 2: Talib Kweli)
Walk with God be still and listen
Try to talk to God what's real I’m spitting
Call 'em Christ by name but he still ain’t rising
Set to my lane but still ain’t listening
Got ice in the veins remain so frigid
Still in the kill brain cells when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don’t stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain’t living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving
People of colour 25% more likely than whites to face prison
But just because the president is black there’s no more racism?
Post-racial? More like most racial
The hate for you disgraceful
Don’t let it take you off your base, let it motivate you
Don’t let it overtake you, so what another cloud
Survive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild
Wow

(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

Memories live, man, and my memories stay alive..
(more talk)



[Hook]
Uh, yeah
I said it won’t be long (no)
‘fore we out here baby
Gotta get you up out here baby
Said it won’t be long
‘fore we out here baby
We up out here baby

[J. Cole Verse 1]
I say a prayer and look up in the sky
Thank God even though a nigga headed to this tired day job
Will my eyes stay wide still I know I’m gonna blow
This is music for my niggas cause I know you want more
Cause that old shit fake but this new shit real
J. Cole not Jay but this that Blueprint feel
Hey Cole is you crazy that's some big boots to fill
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well
Seen heaven, seen hell, seen niggas get killed
Knew every detail still never would tell
Scared of the repercussion, scared of them people bussin'
Bullets be hittin’ nigga’s you swear they could be percussion
Niggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing
No law, but became a man on my own
Showed my momma I could stand on my own

[Hook]

[J. Cole Verse 2]
Dear mama, your son hurting
Living in this cold World where niggas shun virgins
And praise hoes
As days go by shawty 19 years old
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly
Tell me why mamma do you cry
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise
Mamma I know it hurts
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him
So whats the options for him
A young nigga from the hood without a pops at home
Surrounded by no good
And soon no good becomes so good quick
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich
Killing your hood with the same shit Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with
And it’s still in your hood shit
I’m feeling no good mamma
I’m sick of my soul
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope
I just hope and I pray
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way
And mamma I can fly you out this cold world
This cold life, it’s all wrong
There’s no right
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light
Just grab onto me, trust me hold tight!

[Hook]

(Intro)

Creeper
Awwwwwwwwwww Man

(Verse 1)

I've seen the titty goblin (uh)
He had a swollen knob and (bruh)
He called me gay (lol)
So I told his mom on him
"Titty Goblin
Don't call people gay"
Tittyman cried
Laugh I did

(Chorus)

It's the night of the titty man
He's out calling your dad a fag
He's not very nice
His dad left and did ice
He'll put you in a FEMA camp
His nan will touch your ass
It's the titty man

(Verse 2)

[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God (Cole the God, Cole the God)

[Outro]
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune
(Sound of baby laughing)
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars of a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune



[Intro]

Uh (yeah)
Can I make a million dollars
Off a rap tune?
Hey (check)


[Verse 1]

The real is back, I'm here in fact
I never left, I been grinding for
4 weeks straight I'm outta breath
I been giving you all my answers
I'm not a test but I'm passing
With fly-ing colors, look at this mess
They steadily killin' up all our brothers
I'm in distress, I can go on for days and days
But I digress, The Revolution won't
Be televised man we playing chess?
Cause these Kings and Queens
Don't know they position but hey!
We blessed, I pray we figure it out one day
And nonetheless, I thank you Cole for
Performing "Be Free" on Letterman
Let's use our platform and try to do
Good for-the-better man
Cause it seems we all focused on
Clothes and cheddar man
On the media
That's all they really want us to see!
So they can control us
And we fight and divide
With no UNITY!
But I believe in US, him, her
Them and you and Me!
So keep ya head up
Let Rise Above and just sing (uh)

[Hook]

Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One things for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low
(then you aim too low)

[Verse 2]

What's the price of a black man life?
The cops killed Tamir Rice
And ruled it out a homicide
He was only 12
Let's just hope the judge don't let em slide
Cause you stay voting for office
When the justice system is a lie
And we try to get by
But look around, nigga it hurts
Wilson murdered Michael Brown
And was given a reward (a million dollars)
It's a slap in the face
Nigga it's stab with a sword
But the people will soon rise UP
ALL ON one accord...
Try to hold us down for long?
One thing you can't!
Fuckin cowards and scaredy cats?
Nigga One thing we ain't
So you can throw ya tear gas
White oppression and fucking paint
But we gonna stand our fucking ground
Until we motherfucking faint!
Ain't it a damn shame how many lives we lost?
Some white people they can't remorse
They rather not be involved
They rather stay neutral
Defend these cops and black ball
But if u ain't a minority
You can't feel the pain at all....
So don't get mad when I'm screaming out
"Black Lives Matter!"
Cause it's the truth in every sense
Of the word and the latter
White supremacy and white privilege
Is all that's around us
But I be got-damned if
I let that shit drown us
I'm a stand tall
I'm a do my best
On a mission for better days
And we ain't done yet
Continue to stick together
Until everyone's set
They say we fighting for nothing
And tomorrow we'll forgot
Nigga bet

[Hook]

Don't give em too much you
Don't let em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One things for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low
(you aim too low)

[Verse 3]

Justice for KJ
You gon' keep on hearing
Until his parents find peace
And a Valdosta a new sheriff
We tired of the racism
And the constant oppression
You try covering up a murder
And soon you'll be confessing
It's funny
Cause just look at the way that God works
You can reenact your statement
You can say false words
You can threaten the whole city
You can cover up yo' dirt
But nigga
Karma is a bitch and
She knows what you deserve (huh?)
(yeah) I said she knows what you deserve (nigga)
(yeah) I said she knows what you deserve
You can threaten the whole city
You can cover up your words
But nigga Karma is a bitch and
She know What you deserve Chris Prine
She know what you deserve Chris Prine
(yeah) Bell brothers
We know what you deserve, nigga

Operation Title Town (Bitch)

Fayetteville, North Carolina
Fayettenam
*Crowd cheers*
2, 6, make some motherfuckin' noise one time tonight, God damn it! Bring all the lights up please so I could see everybody in this motherfucker one time tonight, God damn. Ayy, this shit's crazy.

Ayy, yo, you know we see this shit down here, this shit lit, this shit lit. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself. I go by the name of J. Cole, Cole fucking World, and I'm from the Ville. A few months back, I dropped this album, it's called 2014 Forest Hills Drive, and shit I don't know if people heard about that shit. They tryna say, they tryna say it was the first album to go platinum without no fuckin' features and shit. They said that, they said that, I ain't say that, they said that, but since they said that, since they said that. Fayetnam, if it's cool with y'all, and only if it's cool with y'all, I'm tryna perform the whole fuckin' album for ya'll tonight if that's cool with you. Can I do that shit on some Ville shit? Ok then, on some Ville shit, ok then. But y'all know this whole album is a journey, from front to back, this whole shit is a journey. So before we get too far in the fucking journey, I wanna press rewind and take ya'll to a time where I was just a young boy



[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to ride/write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through, how could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my ways
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it

[Verse 2]
Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
Nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like thanks for the view
Waiting on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cold as your phone on zero percent Going Off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Hook]

[Bridge]



[Intro]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'mma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'mma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—



J. Cole Cleanup!Fayetteville's own, J. Cole is arguably the best artist from North Carolina. so we intend to cleanup his songs as much as possible. The purpose of this page is to keep track of the songs that have been fixed. Also a huge thanks to Babuc for creating this amazing cleanup guideline as he originally created the Pop Cleanup. Anyways each song will be judged from 0-5 on the annotation about the song, with 0 being empty/close to empty, 1 being in terrible shape (covered completely in bad annotations), 2 being in meh shape (halfway covered in bad annotations), 3 being in ok shape (has some of both), 4 being in pretty good shape (mostly Genius 'tates), and 5 being in perfect, lockable shape. 5 is what we're shooting for!

Check out the tracklist for J. Cole's albums below. Note that this includes an artist bio, album descriptions, and other important to-dos!

[Refrain: EarthGang]
Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Verse: J. Cole]
Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes, there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Said all that I could say now I play with thoughts of retirement

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Refrain: EarthGang]
Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

[Verse 1: Drake]
26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Interlude: Dennis Graham]
But that’s… that’s where all this.. that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang..
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…

[Verse 2: Drake]
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Feel naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded
Started, hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back



[intro]
What if we wan't here to survive, what if i die tomorrow who would miss me huh, probably no one most people don't realize they take life for granted but  once  they open there eyes they see the truth that's fallen between them


[hook]

Tell me you love me, my heart can't be on replay just tell me you love me
My life been taking by your love, you so are my love were should we go from here
Your so close i can't bare, it tearing me down, breaking me down i'm drowning in tears
I can't go on so and so on cause you know we were mean't for each other
It got me so lonely missing the one's close to me, who i miss dearly the one's in my heart
We so different i can't bare to be apart my soul is your now, tell me what to do
I'm going crazy without you, i'm going crazy without you

[verse 1 ]
My heart broken in so many places i don't know were to begin
Just tell me
Me and you should be good friends just me and you please don't break my heart like the other's do
Your worth more then the other's two, i just realize i got more stuff with you
Your my soul girl it breaking me down just to grow old with you
Were should we take off
Kissing you holding you tight i just wan't you so bad you don't know what you do to me
Wishin



[Intro]
OK, I know this sounds like Hell Of A Life by Kanye West but it’s not
Don’t worry, it’s gonna be okay
These are just ad-libs for the song
Don’t worry, it’s gonna be okay, he’s gone

[Refrain]
He’s gone, he ain’t gonna gonna worry
His ass is gone, he’s got a lot of stories
He’s gone, he ain’t gonna gonna worry
His ass is gone, he’s got a gun of stories
(now, Juanitox)

[Couplet 1]
Confédéré, plutôt consanguin ouais
Raciste, puriste, t’aimes pas notre musique ? (nique ta race)
La grosse chatte à ta mère
Mais là y’a trop de MST

[Pont]
Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi
Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi (yaaaaaooooi)

[Couplet 2]
Un groupe interracial entre un blanc et un babtou
À chaque fois que j’suis avec Bartox
Dépression, érection, je me sens au fond du trou
J’peux pas mourir demain sinon Time Paradox

[Refrain]
He’s gone (all gone), he ain’t gonna gonna worry (all gone)
His ass is gone (all gone), he’s got a lot of stories
He’s gone (all gone), he ain’t gonna gonna worry (all gone)
His ass is gone (all gone), he’s got a gun of stories

[Couplet 3]
Grosses bites, grosses basses
Les sons de Y40i, ça tabasse
Je pèse dans l'game comme Gérard Baste
Pèse sur la balance (poucave)
Go fast
Je te mets en transe
Fréquence grasse dans ta face
Je te découpe en tranche
Aucune trace de ta race
Je mets mon joint dans ta culasse
Plein de crasse

[Refrain]
He’s gone (all gone), he ain’t gonna gonna worry (all gone)
His ass is gone (all gone), he’s got a lot of stories
He’s gone (all gone), he ain’t gonna gonna worry (all gone)
His ass is gone (all gone), he’s got a gun of stories

(yeah)



[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
From the intro you know I'm so influential cause I'm glowing like a candle
The focus is so essential dog, what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you, they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police, want that info, they'll grill 'em like Portobellos
I'm murdering instrumentals cause I rap with the conscience
To villains, killers and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still fulfilling the promise, so nice I kill 'em with kindness
Hitting like Muhammad Ali, you more like Tatyana
All this is probably Karma, you dishonored the father
Whether it's God almighty, or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor
Look in the scope, my people still a target

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'?
Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge
I'm in New York now, like Akeem and Semmi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious BUM, uh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution
This that black Elohim Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan Hakeem Olajuwon Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the courtroom, screaming 'Who Dat?' on the devil
Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizing the ghetto

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And shorty, you straight, bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol, bet I'm about to ball
And never let up, look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention, this is clever, I'm Pau Gasol
Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers, I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign, boy you know I'mma shine
Flow is in Ramadan, cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick, man I should throw a condom on
Ay, cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas, I just lock and load squeeze
Dog I'm on a higher level, I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his Glock but won't squeeze
Please

[Verse 4: Mos Def]
Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble pla-anted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master djinn, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem, and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shining out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon polish
All about nothing where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him, there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

[Outro: Mos Def]
You're welcome, thanks
Appreciation for your participation
Special dedication
Celebration, bitches



[Intro]
"That was the warm up, that was the warm up, baby
Aight, Elite, for real, one take, dawg, and I'm up outta here
One, yup, yeah."

[Verse]
Lord, please forgive me for my sinning
I ain’t saying that I’m finished, but I’m praying in advance
Cause the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yeah, ball game
I swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans when a nigga took the chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like Bobby had Whitney, we was cooking up crack
But them fifteen credits had a nigga off track
Picture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
But mastered this rap shit
You hear the words coming from my lips bastards
I never crack, I got that Chapstick
I practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where’s the ladder?
Cause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that
No Soprano, half black, half white; I’m a piano
I’m an animal, my video on Discovery Channel
I’m a beast when my shit hits the streets, these niggas cease to exist
Like a beach in a tsunami,  you'll find me in the ‘Ville
In the state of NC
Bitch, if I ain’t back home, I’m up in NYC
‘Bout that money prob-ly like a fucking robbery
But I ain’t jacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
Hey, take a hard look at my drive nigga, no hacking on my shit
I’m straight smacking niggas, straight tagging niggas
Yo, I freestyle and fuck you niggas, ya’ll be wilding and I’m out



Verse 1:
Wake up i say "fuck my life"
Like a demon in a circle , yeah i'm stucked inside
You gotta know, should young man turn left or right
Can you understand the reason why i left your life
I got to work, i got to work, yeah it's everyday
Every year mom's birthday can't be celebrated
24 not enough for the goal we chase
Popo, can not ride so my homies skate
Roadside, snow,ices yeah we keep the heat
B-boy,C-girl take a deeper breath
Olie over your dick head like six feet
Last night, lil homie got a kickflip
H O O K:
This shit skater made
This shirt skater made
Lil homie made a small space fade away
Need to find a way
What you chase today
New trucks, new board homies skate away

Chorus:
This shit skater made
This shirt skater made
Lil homie made a small space fade away
Need to find a way
What you chase today
New trucks, new board homies skate away

Verse 2:
Homie dealer, homie saigon silver
Homie startin' a brand , look up to the future
Off the wall, through the street, got a new beat
Lil homie turns himself into a killer
Show out your skill we are difference
Tall,slim,old,young but same passion
Don't give a fuck, i don't mess with you
Boards in your head straight to heaven
Just a young boy, i do it on my own
And shout out to all my homies that i know
Tonight will be burn by my flow
YELLOWA, keep it real til my eyes closed
S K A T E man my life
S K A T E when i'm high
S K A T E make some tricks
S K A T E FUCKING BITCH!!



[Verse: Young Tero]

This might be the realest shit you ever heard
Word, the way I get them all hype for me
It's like I don't even live it, like there's a nigga who writing for me
And I let all my punchlines do the fighting for me
What's crazy is I ain't even really trying
These guys think that they eating, just because they team dyin'
We killed them all
Whack niggas can smell what I'm cooking
Can't come in my kitchen, I'm baked like beans, but yall just spill them all
You niggas 'bout as common as a black iPhone
Whenever you aren't around, your girl raps my songs
She's always on my line, like she tapped my phone
And she let me beat the kitten 'til its a black eye on
It, shit, get-rich-quick schemes and big dreams of being the greatest
Nigga in hip-hop who tryna save it
By telling my story, I'm known to spit that
My presence got these women sweating like Jodeci's back

[Hook: J.Cole & Young Tero]
Jodeci back
Bitches screaming like Jodeci back
I call the front desk for condoms, she saying they ain't got none
The way that I'm responding, she know that we black, nigga

Jodeci back
Fucking hoes like Jodeci back
I paint pictures and flip words
A nigga would have thought Def Poetry back

[Verse 2: Young Tero]
Matter fact, scratch that, I think I'm Keith Sweat
Bet I make it last forever
Man, I'm better than any of these damn competitors
I've never heard of him, nope, not even the slightest word of his existence
Me and the Streets got a thing going, commitment
And it's still fuck the world, like the planet was my mistress
Bitches feel like I owe 'em, cause I never show 'em interest
In a sense, it's safe to say that they're senseless
Wise, man, my bars are gold, frankincense and myrrh
We in here, like Jesus in the womb with us
Mama crying out his name, know he in the room with us
Riding with our squad, like they gone be in the tomb with us
We working, of course, somebody got to keep the tools with us
Stuck in the grand scheme of things, that's the fool in us
Counting money up, only time the school in us
Niggas here ain't got a home, that explains the ruthlessness

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Tero]
I'm just tryna make history, like that was the Most High's plan
I won't ever cross the streets, don't ask to hold my hand
I gotta represent and show these people what I'm made of
Ain't nobody fucking with me, like I never made love
Fear is seeming like the only thing that I'm afraid of
I don't care if they hate us, we tryna get our change up
All about that paper, that's part of the lesson
And I'm the answer to everything that's part of the question
You can see my team strong, we don't do no flexing
And when it comes to these tracks, I'm a dinosaur, T wrecks it
And to think, I was considering a break
These niggas want beef, well, I'm considering the stakes
See, I ain't got a problem, if you haters can't add it up
Cause I got goons that keep the fire, no Donald Trump
Name a team that's flyer than the Pilots
Pussy stay wet around us, I'm feeling like an island

[Breakdown: Young Tero]
No one child should have all of this power, bruh
Take a losing team and turn them niggas to the Mighty Ducks
Take a quiet girl and make a pornstar out of her
Take a pornstar and take the pornstar out of her
Take a whore and I could turn her to Michelle Obama
I am so grade A, make them wanna tell they mama
Counting them Franklins, while I'm bumping Aretha
Making sure my ducats stay high like Wiz Khalifa
I'm a dreadhead nigga with some anime features
Smartest kid in class, astounded all his teachers
I do this for my mom, I do this for my father
I do this for Cy'Ron, I do this shit for Tikka
I burn green and listen when the Lord talking to me
Moses of the Rap Game, I got to free my people
I ain't perfect, but I'm giving my all
Girls who hated me grew into women to call
They always said, "Sure, Tero's different and all
But he's a lame, he won't ever get in the drawls"
Broad please, I'm the shit, you've never been in the stall
All my niggas riding with me, like they been in the car
And I'm the real deal, like I been in a jar
Beyonce told ya I'm a soldier, I been in the war
I ain't stopping, all I know is accelerate
The highest technique, get elevated then meditate



[Intro]
Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Get paid a pretty Penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"
With the flick of the pen, write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil Maine is the best mc out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters

[Pre-Hook]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 2]
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke"
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga 'cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto

[Pre-Hook]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place
In that PJ Rosé, I drink that shit by the case
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win
Street life will have you drunk, I'm talkin Seagram’s Gin
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life and Times
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart
Life is staged, I just played my part
Haha, yeah

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part



[Kerney Thomas]
I'm just thankful
18 years of suffering gone just like that
You've been suffering 18 years yourself
You've been going through pure hell but it can be over just that fast
This is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens of thousands across the country
That were hurting for God to heal them
And God could work a miracle for them
All you gotta do is either log on to our website
Or you can dial the toll-free number
And place your order right there
For the Personal Prayer Package
I want you quickly, to place that order right now
For the Personal Prayer Package
Pick up the telephone right now
I said pick up the phone right now
You're past due a miracle



[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Bridge]
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Verse 2]
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

[Outro]
They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind



[Verse 1]
Drama is a must
Kinda like a condom when I buss
I'm rotten but I'm polished
I'm a diamond in the rough
From North Cacs
Never could I come off whack
Some of y'all cats is pussys I ain't hung off that
Call your squad get every nigga off the block
Call the cops the SWAT team
All to stop me
I cock these
Y'all niggas is frost cuz you talk a lot
But never strap like a halter top
Y'all are not gangters for God's sake cool it
'For you snooze and pick the wrong nigga to fool with
An you get introduced to two fists, Timbaland boots are mint
And beat to death with a pool stick
I'm through with jokes
I'm through with stupid folks that say they get hanged
Whats the use its hopeless
You fools is smokin
Me loosing focus
It's like a mother fucker drinking juice and chocking
My mood is upset
Your crew is suspect
My unit is some niggas I dare you to fuck with
Plus, I'm the illest as soon as I feel it hittin
You can't fight the feeling revealing mi killah instinct

[Hook]
I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
You willing to die, No
That's why we all gotta live a killer inside yo
Whether it's a tool or I use a knife
If the mood is right concludes your life
I'm bruisin
N I'll take it to any nigga to doubt that
This killa be killed and I ain't even out yet

[Verse 2]
The bigger they come the harder they drop
I give it all that I got
My money couldn't find another artist to rock
Harder I'm cock
Diesel i'm nice
Move like a theif in the night
Sickest Mo'fucker to ever breath on the mic
Is here in the flesh
Sincere when I swear I'm the best
Niggas ain't tryna hear it unless you do it correct
Never losing a step
Never losing respect
You act stupid and step I'll introduce you to death
I'm losing my head
A few screw lose in my neck
I'm not stable
I came real y'all drop fakers
You not able to hang one around your finish
I never draw the line unless you're surrounded in it
Watered down niggas drownin in it
But surrounded by angus
Niggas hold me down and menace
Crash you this major don't take offence please
Blaming your face is a basic instinct

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You [?]some shit fucked
Cuz every word I utter is intent you faggot
Fukin with this is like punching cement
I know your type you bluffin with tough talk
You scared to brawl
Never steppin but your mind is running marathons
It's hopeless, I'm focussed, I won't miss
Any fool wanna oppose get your throat slit
You can't call it I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learn from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit
Throw fists even if your voice is deep
Niggas suffer from arthritis their joints is weak
North Cacs where the mo'fuckin turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo Funny how tables turn in life
Pay your dues earn your stripes
Never be concerned with ice
Cuz check it out
The more money you pay for it
It's just giving even me more reasons to take this shit
The main event, serving niggas
The way y'all run through these herds with these words is disturbing niggas
So leave it alone
I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
Don't need to play games, I'm in a league of my own
It's Therapist niggas
Dismiss you dick kisses
For you to get bigger your shit is slimmer than stick figures
Faggots can't stand how much love I get
But if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm takin over
I got what it takes to make it over the top
You tryna test me then stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feelin the most
Stepped off stage got arrested for stealing the show
Mother fucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah cuz I ain't going out yet, Mo'fucka
It's Therapist I got the killah instinct
Nervous Reck he got the killah instict
F[?] Rich he got the killah instinct
The whole fucking Crash room they got the killah instinct
My man All Mighty he got the killah instinct
My man Dialect he got the killah instinct
The nigga Volatile he got the killah instinct
Omen and Elite them niggas got the killah instinct
It's killah instinct



[Verse 1]
Momma, I just killed a man
My body still trembling, can you feel my hand?
Don’t shed no tears, it won’t be long before they find out it was me, Momma
This may be the last time you see me free, Ma, don't spend it crying
You did your best, me, I was blessed, know you were stressed trying
To keep me out the streets, me, ducking police
Trying not to make a peep to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skipping class, flunking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehow I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right, but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you 'shamed of me?
Dry your face, Mommy, you're not to blame for me
See, I’m a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder ’bout my father, would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running 'round with the lowlifes?
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas kill for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger, Momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga, Momma
But what’s done is done
I’m on the run, I live my life like a movie now it’s way too realer
Who would've thought your baby boy would've grew up to be a killer?

[Chorus]
Yeah, now I’m a killer
Guess I’m a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah, I mean the killers

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"I mean—murderers! Do you hear me? Real live murderers!
I thought black people killed people by accident!
Nah, these motherfuckers was murderers."

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Yeah, I wonder what's in store for me, lately been stressing
Pray for blessings, hope that there’s more for me than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot, worked on the gunshot
Who woulda thought? I used to block this nigga's lay-ups
Now he’s in a cell layed up, I wish you well, stay up
Like insomniacs, this life can make a
Nigga fold like a laundry mat, I sip this cognac, though
To ease my brain from all this pain and so that I react slow
In this fast world, slow niggas, fast girls
Ho's give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on ‘em, hold up that old checker flag for ‘em
Chalk lines by the do not park sign, it’s deep
All these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I’d rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell ‘em now boy, don’t make me turn into a killer, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, into a killer
Don’t make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeah yeah

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"Triple life... How do you do triple life?
That mean if he die and come back... He gotta go to penitentiary!
Right there, he said "Fuck kindergarten. Get your little ass on in the penitentiary, motherfucker. You know what you did last time."

[Verse 3]
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda ever thought that time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day, swore that we would make the league and be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, aw shit
Watch how they pile up, seem like a mile up
I washed the blisters on my hands and then I'd dial up
My best friend, skating rink is where we headed at night
And if a nigga disrespect, oh yes, we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seem petty, at the time the shit was heavy
'Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas got their brains blowed out
Snatch a niggas chain and he got his name wrote out
In obituaries, another body in a cemetery
Another young nigga in the penitentiary
And he don’t give a fuck: no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture, nigga: Pictionary
Tell you what it is, I’m a dictionary
I knew a nigga threw his dick in e'ry chick in e'ry
City that he went to, went hard like the rent due
'Til he met the wrong bitch, man, just came
Home ex-convict, and he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers

[Outro]
Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I’m a killer



[Intro]
It’s like dreaming is counterproductive
For some, it’s beneficial
For others, it’s detrimental

[Verse 1]
Life has begun
Exit out your mother’s chamber
Cock back that pistol and there’s no goin’ back
Ain’t no change up’s
It was your father’s pistol that put life in her magazine
The same day your uncle’s life was taken from a pistol with ease
From that day forward your father was a true alcoholic
Never missed a beat, always had a reason to be at the bar
When you was born, he tried to kick the habit, be a pappy
But it kicked back, he would relapse and then repeated the pattern
Growing up, you were too familiar with getting smacked in the back of your head
Being reminded, “You’re an accident”
It was systematic the way he made it clear
He would punch your moms in her face and make it appear to be your fault
His words were so convincing
You were so young, you were convinced to kill yourself
He was missing out on a relationship he should’ve kept
Now you disinfect the streets full of pests with a Tec
You blame it on his neglect

[Hook]
I never did you wrong
Why would you try to kill me off?
You used to call on me
Just 'cause it seems like hope that I bring don’t make a change
Now you write me off as if all your dreams are gone

[Verse 2]
The needle drops on the song of misfortune
It’s unfortunate he’s so unsupportive
Looked for abortion clinics to sever responsibilities
He said, “Fuck having a baby, keep it away from my vicinity”
Goddamnit, that backlash was strong enough to split your soul in half
Enough to wanna be picking a pistol up and make it blast
Right on the next motherfucker tryna look for some ass
Like, “I just lost my fiancé, why would you get a pass?”
The outcome so far from what you expected
He was acting reckless the minute he found out you was pregnant
I mean, he wasn’t the type of nigga to pick up a tool and flex it
He was so calm and collected
Well respected, check it
Even your family was in the deepest gaze
They was infatuated with his graduation, and it pays
You thought of beautiful future, now it’s tainted anguish
From the constant drinking and domestic violence, ain’t no peaceful language

[Hook]
I never did you wrong
Why would you try to kill me off?
You used to call on me
Just 'cause it seems like hope that I bring don’t make a change
Now you write me off as if all your dreams are gone

[Verse 3]
A phone call from your father saying, “Congratulations!”
The timing couldn’t be better: three days from your graduation
All seemed well, you had a fiancée
She bumps Beyoncé as y’all cruise down the freeway
But, you can overhear your mom say something about your brother
Something is up; you can hear your father shut up your mother
She insists to tell you, but he says it’s not for discussion
He said, “Derell’s felonious ways should not cause a disruption
So, do not ask about him”
You threaten to hang up the phone if he don’t spit it out
But, he’s concerned that you’ll follow your brother or take a different route
As fate would have it, the day that you became a pappy
Your brother was tryna leave the game and make his family happy
Oh, such good news! You wonder why your father held it
Except there’s more to the story, your brother was just a weapon
His gang plotted on robbin’ you and your family
He intervened on the scene, became a martyr, so rest in peace
But, you can never rest easy knowing his mortality has been verified
Thinking that family never dies, especially not your brother
“Why was his life taken early? Did my success need sacrifice?”
Your anger shows in the way that you treat your woman
You tell her your drinking habits exist because she did not get an abortion
You refuse to admit it’s because the death of your brother
But now, 20 years later, your son has just become a statistic
All the while, his abortion was supposed to prevent it



When it comes to originality
You know these people can't spare us
So when they hear something new
They feel the urge to compare it
Listen close, ’fore this go over your head like Tu-pe
You say I sound like J
They used to compare him to Lupe
But before Cole was Drake
'Cause I was singin' all my hooks
And before ’em all was Eminem
But strictly for my looks
You people make me sick
Hop the fuck off my dick and let me flow
Yes they all inspire me, but I am me
And now you know
So let me hit the studio like a pro
Everything that you ever heard has come right from the soul
And I won't stop until I earn my name, that's my goal
I won't stop until I earn my name, that's my goal
'Cause I am Nas, I am Pac, I am Biggie, I am Jay
I am Wu, coming through
Mos Def, here to stay
I'm the roots, I am slim
He is me, I am him
We are all known as one
We were all born KiN
I am hip-hop
We all hip-hop



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Baby I don't mean to disrespect 'ya
But I wanna twist my tongue all in 'ya
(wanna twist my tongue all in 'ya)
Get you wet and hope I slip and fall in 'ya
I don't give a fuck about your past
Life is strange, people grow, feelings change
Nothing really lasts, my God
While we here, can we just live in the moment?
If the shit ain't real I don't want it
Don't do fake titties, fake ass
Don't do fake niggas, fake laughs
Give me something I can feel
I can tell that you been through it all
Don't mean to offend you at all
Do you want me in them drawers?
Tell the truth

[Hook 1]
Oh kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Oh kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes
Kind of, sometimes, maybe

[Verse 2:]
Am I still afraid of the dark?
No bright ideas, I keep the lights on
Are you wasting my time?
And your time, every time
Why you're makin' it hard?
I won't show you my cards
But you came and you lost
Do I want you at all?
OK, just a bit, I hate to admit

[Hook 1]

[Pre-Hook]
I just sit here and I'm thinkin'
If I still want you?!
So why say

[Hook 2]
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yea
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that due to body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea



[Intro]
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, hey
And on the count of three, Blow up, Blow up

[Verse]
Yeah, and that I will, nigga, that I will
I keep a checklist of rappers that I'mma kill
I used to play the bleachers before I had a deal
Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel
Hmm, ill, fantastic
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga, "Jam"nastics
Your style hot now, but they just can't last with
Something like the rap sand-castle
Gone with the tide, I'm here for the seasons
Bend yo' ass over bitch I'm here for a reason
Cold breezin', flow freezin'
This ain't spittin' ho, I'm sneezin'
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them Lowes doors, is what I throw keys in
Man, talk about a come up
Niggas see me in the street they talk about 'The Come Up'
Or talk about 'The Warm Up'
Or "Nigga, when your album drop?"
And why these lil' rappers like to run their mouth alot?
And J. Cole, are you really from the south or not?
I see your jeans, man them thangs, must have cost a lot
Aye do you get a chance to hang out with the boss a lot?
Even them hating niggas like you at the barbershop
Cole.. Yeah, that's my muhfucking name
Nigga couldn't even watch the All Star game
Had to do the whole Valentines Day thang
Gotta play the game, so my lady won't complain
Three or four days, I be back on a plane
Do a couple shows, where the people know my name
Look man, the crowd full of pretty young dames
If you gonna do dirt, then you can't leave a stain, man!
Tiger Woods y'all
He like them white girls, I like them hoods y'all
She got her head straight, she got a good job
She give the best brain, she got them good jaw
I got that good game, that's cause I'm good, y'all
And J. Cole the lil' engine that could, y'all
And yeah I'm coming for the top, like I should, y'all
And bitch I never fall off, knock on wood, y'all
Cole



[Intro: Cozz]
Yeah, third take, nigga
Cozz & Effect, nigga
Yeah, yeah, I got to
Yeah, yeah, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Cozz]
Jealousy holding enemies hostage
Eventually the penalty will come and haunt ya
Hennessey memories leaving me nauseous
But the Hennessy makes the melodies awesome
So instead of me talking I'm steady jotting
And steady plotting on how to gain spaghetti toppings
You know that parmesan, that cheddar, mozzarella
The list goes on and on you know my heart is strong
I'm a young phenomenon
It's like these people keep forgetting
It's always the least expected who ends up getting it
So don't tell me bout no niggas hating
What's the point if I hear
Mr. not giving a fuck with a joint in his ear
Put that steak on his plate the sirloin disappear
Empty gut I'm hungry man, the guns pointing this year
I'm feeling like I'm dealing with children boy I'm killing
Niggas already trying to bite styles
You break a tooth if you bite down
Bitch I go way too hard

[Hook 1: Cozz]
Cause I've been in this hood dog for way too long man
I've been quiet for way too long
Been patiently waiting, can't wait too long dog
I've been broke man for way too long
No hot water for way too long
You can't knock the hustle it's way too strong
Man we're way too strong

[Verse 2: Cozz]
Let me touch you with my words, kiss you with a song
Let me fuck you mentally, caress you with a melody
I do it for my enemies but especially for my dogs
So we all get to eat a full bowl of pedigree
These full time hoes get a full bowl of fuck you I'm getting cheese
Well shit, I'm trying to
So I really can't spend time with you
I can't lie to you, to tell the truth
I just wanna lie with you
If that's fine with you
I don't wanna spend no time in school
It's a waste of time
And you can't always do what your parents like all the time
Plus, i got enough degrees anyway
Check my Fahrenheit you see the charts on the table
Fuck getting somber we probably start a label
Fuck getting mine boy I'm tryna feed the table
Fuck being fine girl you gotta have a brain too
You gotta have a brain too cus

[Hook 2: Cozz]
I've been chasing dumb hoes for way too long
I've been in this hood dog for way too long
I've been patiently waiting for way too long
I've been quiet dog for way too long
You can't knock the hustle boy it's way too strong
We've been trying for way too long
Bout to get off been waiting too long nigga

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Death to the imposters, label me the king
My dreams could win Oscars, my niggas turned mobsters
My white friends doctors, fatherless child
Listen how I got this knowledge is wild
Streets taught me, speak softly nigga watch from the crowd
Cause any nigga that's loud, just want attention and eventually blaow
No fake niggas allowed in my circle dawg
You been through half the shit I been through it'll hurt ya dawg
Tread softly, my nigga moving state-to-state, running late, watch 'em
Tryna avoid state troopers, that's the weight watchers
Run this dope set, this cake, till they say, "Gotcha"
Or till the fat lady sings, and niggas hate operas
And Oprah hate niggas
Make no mistake that we know the stake still, we hope to make over eight figures
Slim chances, but niggas bet against the odds and who am I to criticise how you play your cards dawg

[Hook 3: J. Cole]
Cause I done beat the odds going way too hard
I been getting slept on for way too long
I been patiently waiting for way too long
I been quiet dawg for way too long
You can't knock the hustle dawg it's way too strong
It's way too strong
I said you can't knock my hustle dawg it's way too strong
It's way too strong

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Look, I never admit it, tryna get my brother acquitted
Yo' tell the judge I be happy to pay him off if he's with it
My flesh and blood, hauled off to the cell
I search for heaven as I see him getting lost in this hell
Headed for coffin or jail, to never try is the ultimate fail
But love is wanting more for someone than they want for themselves
Deep, I guess I love a lot
Because the more I do my thang the more I feel the guilt and shame that my brother's not
Reminisce as we was kids screaming "Fuck a cop"
Guess he took it serious, for me that shit was just for props
Arms too skinny to hug the block
I found comfort in my dreams of things seen on the screen of fortune and fame
Decisions, decisions, the Porsche or the Range
I take a trip back to the 'Ville only corpses remain
Some of them niggas still breathing but they dead inside
Victims of a genocide
Tears fill my eyes dawg

[Hook 4: J. Cole]
Cause I've been out of touch man for way too long
I've been out in Hollywood for way too long
I've been, getting this paper for way too long
I ain't called my pops back in way too long
I done make my girl wait for way too long
I wonder if I changed, am I way too on?
Can't knock my hustle, but it's way too strong
It's way too strong

[Intro]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick

Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

[Verse 1]
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip

[Verse 2]
How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip

This is what you call a flip

Verse:
I don’t need no one to put me on
I don’t need no one to keep going
I got the drive the whole journey long
You stop at the service like everyone
Look, I don’t need no one to do nothin
I’m on a mission to prove something
I’m tryna get on another level boy you need to get up and do something
Look, I don’t need no one at all
I do it my own
I’m grinding til Forbes
Denying your calls
We don’t need to talk
And shit if we do there best be a cost
Look, talk isn’t cheap
Goat isn’t sheep
God isn’t man
You isn’t me
Feb isn’t JAN
March doesn’t leap
I do not stand, I’m out of league
Look, I don’t need no one to do nothing
I’m on a mission to prove something
You treading on ice and that’s cool runnings
I do not beef cause that proves nothing
I’m on my way to the money
Away from fuck shit, aroma was funny
I came from the dirt now my trousers are muddy
Squinting my eyes cause my future is sunny
I don’t need no one to tell me shit
Bread over beef that’s that deli shit
I make it rain that confetti shit
While she pick it up that’s some heavy shit
I don’t need no one to prove me right
And I won’t be here to be proven wrong
Thing about life is it moves along
And you do it right or get left alone
I got 7 inches of pipeline, tell her call her friend for a life line
I just manage from the sideline
While them bitches playing in the white lines
I caught the wind I’m on kite time
I could hang myself from the skyline
Boy I’m years ahead I’m on my time and the future coming like a high tide
You gonna run away, but i built some shit to ride the wave in the time of day
You were sleeping I was wide awake
Blowing up like a china lake
I don’t need no one like ice when it’s snowing
They blow their nose with the money your blowing
Hard and too far only places I’m going
Rocks on my neck all my diamonds Samoan
Sike, I don’t rock shit
Got the keys locksmith
Plane tee, cock pit
At your throat locket
Got the bars locked in
Every tape drops hit
Playing With Fire hot shit
Reloaded full clip
Part 2, part 2
Drawing from my life cartoon
Staying on point harpoon
Say I’m thirsty she a lagoon
Said you pay attention once due
But I guess you lie like after June
Kill the beat and put it in the tomb
Post mortem PM afternoon
Singing to the universe in tune
Ego like a bulletproof balloon
Tell the sandman I’m a fucking dune
Tell her Friend I wanna fuck her too
I hop in the booth in beast mode
Got no game I got the cheat code
She hop on skrt off like speed boat
Made her journey better Heathrow
Told myself I won’t let you die unless you a legend when it’s time to go
All this shit was written Vince Russo
I can see the future from Pluto
I woke up from a Koma with a Boner
And a head full of ideas, then we bring heat boy degrees
And we got diplomas
I won the race I’m just lapping man
Nothing cooler than my biggest fan
I’m so creative that I swear I could make a bigger bang
Like the Taliban
Oooh, I clean my mess up with rags to riches
I bag your misses
Don’t buy her bag
I buy her flag in which she can wave you away from a distance I’m out



[Intro]
Yeah, hey, look

[Verse 1]
When she talk she so closed-minded
All she wanna do is shop, she so clothes minded
Wanna cop the latest 'fore them other hoes find it
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it
Probably 'cause she so fine it'll blow your mind
She black and Pocahontas, laid back and blow that chronic
Ass so fat, wanna tat my logo on it
So any other nigga that a tap will know it's mine
I put in work overtime
Let me cut, mow the lawn, guarantee I blow your mind
She tried to play me 'til she learned I wrote a rhyme
"That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, oh girl, that boy the bomb
No chain around his neck, but better watch out for the charm"
You're not my daughter, um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies

[Chorus: J. Cole & Lee Fields (Sampled)]
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
Beautiful ladies, yeah
Now I ain't tricking, but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
Ladies, yeah
Now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
All you ladies, yeah
Now if you from the suburbs or the hood (Yeah, ayy, look)
Beautiful ladies

[Verse 2]
She said "I got a man", well, baby I don't give a fuck
See me I understand, and I ain't tryna split you up
Okay, give me your number and later I'ma hit you up
If you sleep I get you up, ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up, yeah, do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my t-shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on, come hop up on this ski jet
You scared of that water or you just scared to get your weave wet?
Barely got your feet wet, yes, I know where we headed
Tryna see you throw it back, let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for
You could be my cuddy buddy, baby, what are friends for?
I speed up the tempo, them other niggas lazy
Can't fuck with nuttin' younger than the eighties
I'm grown and I'm looking for some ladies, ladies, yeah

[Chorus: J. Cole & Lee Fields (Sampled)]
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
Beautiful ladies, yeah
Now I ain't tricking, but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
Ladies, yeah
Now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
All you ladies, yeah
Now if you from the suburbs or the hood (Yeah, ayy, look)
Beautiful ladies

[Outro: Lee Fields & Ladies]
Hey girl, what's your name?
Oh wow, you look so nice
I know you man is satisfied
Ayy, young lady, what's your name?
Oh wow, I know your man is pleased
All the way down to his knees
And what's your name?
Tell me, I know yo man is worried
About where you are tonight, huh
Well ladies, all you ladies
All over the world
I want you to help me sing this, here we go
Ladies
Beautiful ladies
Oh
Ladies
All of you ladies
Beautiful ladies



[Interlude 1]
There are major developments tonight in the case of a neighborhood watch Captain in Florida who shot and killed an unarmed 17-year-old. The U.S. Justice Department has now opened a civil rights investigation and the local prosecute has convened a grand jury to consider criminal charges. Justice correspondent Bob Lore has the latest.

[Interlude 2]
He ain't even do nothing wrong! We continue following a very hostile breaking news situation. There is outrage tonight from those reacting to a Ferguson police officer shooting and killing an 18-year-old. The community is flooding the streets of North county demanding answers.

[Interlude 3]
Tonight Cleveland police have confirmed the 12-year-old boy died this morning and they are identifying him as Tamir Rice. The shooting happened outside of the Cardel Rec Center on Cleveland's West side yesterday afternoon. Chief investigator Ron Reagan joins us from there live tonight and Ron, it's turns out the weapon was in fact a police gun.

[Verse]
How we ever gone see 25
When these dudes run around like they got a Vendetta
And these phony politicians ain't addressing nothing they just cheesing for the cameras like we never been better
So let me get it straight, because of the color of my skin you can shoot me and my brothers like dogs?
Looking at the television seeing all my people bleed like our lives don't mean nothing at all
This is more than a trending topic on Twitter
So keep your hashtags and retweets
Ya'll thinking this a game or something, this is real life
They really laid out in these streets
I ain't holding back nothing
All these people out here sugar coating
Cause when you speak the truth they try to bury us
Ya'll don't want to face the fact our racism was built into the Constitution of the United States of America
That's real talk

[Interlude 4]
This one involves the video seen around the world by now showing a man named Eric Garner being taken down by mostly plain clothed police officers while being placed under arrest. One of the officers employed a cholk hold, moments later while on the ground after complaining he couldn't breathe he was dead

[Chorus]
Our Lord just make a way
We're dying everyday in the land of the free
The home of the brave
Our Lord just make a way
We're dying everyday in the land of the free
The home of the brave yeah

[Outro: J. Cole]
All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free, all we want to do is be free
All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free, all we want to do is be free



[Intro]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me, bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother room
Like, "Man, I might as well be sleeping in my mother room"
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair, this is so pure
This is so clear, this is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President, you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here, nigga, I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast, yeah
Avoiding the snakes, AKs, and coke, yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man, I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city
Of New York nine years, ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop, drop)

[Verse 2]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn, he turned out to be a genius
Damn, real shit nigga, no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Interlude]
Make, hey, make that ass drop (drop)
Hey, you seen me in this every damn day (drop)
It got the dick hard as a rock (drop)
And I can't control (Let it rock)
Hehe, control

[Verse 3]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
Yeah
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah, back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurting
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah, I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

[Outro]
Hm, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with



[Intro]
La-la-la-laaaa, la lala la lalaaaa

[Chorus]
Now I am (Here's to the Roc')
Hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
(Here's to Roc-a-Fella) It's the Fayettenam
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc')
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up

[Verse 1]
Now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am

[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Verse 2]
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map

[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Outro]
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts."
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name."
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him."
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Verse 1]
Get my girl angry and pissed and give that pussy a kiss
Pushing the same piece of shit until I get me a Bentley
Same niggas, same goals, same dreams and epiphanies
Me and my niggas are same lines as symmetry, wasn't empathy
Remember we would front yard brawl with big Timothy?
Kicked them doors because we had a lot of energy
My brother was locked up for shooting at the enemy
Caught one nigga then caught fifteen
I ain't meet that nigga 'til I was fifteen
Now I'm kicking 16's with a big screen in attempt to get the big cream
Little guy with a big dream, I need guidance
'Cause if I don't succeed, I probably proceed violence
Sippin' on the brown, no Bobby, I don't fuck with nobody
No team and no posse, you can catch it like Shockey
King of all kings, praise Haile Selassie
Rastafari, I don't need nobody, the God's got me

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Interlude]
You ain't used to the hustle, bro
Yeah, that shit how you live
We on a trade for a trade
I do this for you, I do this for you, you know what I mean?
I took the risk, you took the risk, I ain't disrespect it

[Verse 2]
So part of the reason I be so hard on my people
We never had it easy, never had a pot to pee in
I be on my knees praying till my onomatopoeia's packing a coliseum
Ain't no parking, I gotta see J.I.D
Gotta be there for my family, I gotta, can't try to be
I could be out of my mind, thinking logically
No apologies for speaking how I feel, I silently swore solemnly
That I would be the guy to make my black people proud of me
Roses to the mothers of anybody that doubted me
Yo' chick want dick, bitch dove in the covers
Overseen my areas, surveyed over my brothers
You touch them, you kill me, you can't get close to none of us
They still double-dribble, we going for triple-doubles
Triple up on your investment fuckin' with us
Probably have to rock that vest shit, you fuckin' with us
Wait (Nah bro) Huh? (What you talkin' 'bout, homes?)

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Verse 3]
Okay but fuck that shit, I gotta get it, I gotta get 'em
Tired of picking these locks, you don't respect my existence
I used to sleep in my car, never a park or a bench
But damn a nigga was broke, damnit if I didn't get it
Them niggas was thinking that it was just some rap for the kid
One day they gon' hit my phone, hit the show, scream, clap for the kid
Let's get it poppin', they're pulling pistols on apostle Paul
So pay the piper or meet the sniper, legend of the fall
I knew in diapers you and I was nothing alike at all
I do or die, you do it to die, I'm really making calls
You couldn't kill it and take it out of me, the ideology
This the odyssey, I'm Odysseus, you gotta follow me
Watch how I maneuver, I influence the influencers
The flow is like the flu in influenza going through the motion
So I motivate all of my niggas, they tell me kill 'em with kindness
I'd rather kill 'em and their other significants
Writing lyrics in the city with pretty booties and titties
Don't get the cooties, it ain't like the movies
It kinda is 'cause they're shooting, kind of shit is you moving?
Shit I'm pushing, empower the people life where I grew up
Someone tutored the students, these niggas stupidest, stupider, stupid shit
Sick as a bitch, flick of the wrist, my pen cleanse  my many sins
The irony the iron can't straighten out any wrinkle in existence
Ripple in time triple my eyes realistically sick in the mind
Sick in the head?
Wish I was dead, sick on a med, addicted
My lead sick 'em, give 'em, send 'em to hell, eh

[Outro]
Okay, okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a—
Okay, I told motherfuckers I—
Bitch



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Dear Mrs Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job, don't mean to disrespect ya
But we been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby
(Yeah, if you only knew) I got bigger problems baby
Hey
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothing to me
'Cause right now I got my little boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me, listen here
I ain't looking for no tears but my brother got a year
And my mother keep smoking that shit
On top of that I'm broke, please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then I holla

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me
I need to be left
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Mr Policeman
Ayy, am I wrong or ain't you supposed to keep the peace man
I could have swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh no I get it I get it I get it
Or 'cause I'm black? Hmm maybe
Yeah hey tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound
Man i'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frowned on me
With your flashlight tell me what do you see
Thug niggas drug dealers it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mother fucking college degree

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'ma fuckin try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, man, we don't make the news
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods "be fuckin all these white hoes"
Anchorman stop snitchin
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?
Are you perfect motherfucker, how you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone



[Intro: Joey Bada$$ & J. Cole]
Yeah, uh
Yeah
Yeah, uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
This is legendary
Always been my mission, never secondary
Gettin' better every January, it's very scary
They gon' recognize eventually, I take it if they don't give it to me
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)
By a higher conscious spiritually (up, up)
Up and away, jump on a plane, get on my wave right now
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feelin' so well
A token of how I felt, never heard if it fell
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt
Quality what I sell, quantity in the sales
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells
This life I'm livin' it out, damn right, my vision is now
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out
My brothers at the brick house, the undercovers stakeout
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think I do it for? My brothers under a spell
It's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

[Bridge: Joey Bada$$]
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Look, ready for whatever comes
I hope for the best, I taste the peace and pray it never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings done
Perhaps I was foolish, just like the boy that prays to only see the sun
Maybe, life happens like tides
One minute you're low and feelin' shallow, then all of a sudden you rise
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself
Find a way, the weight of my wealth
It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stackin' knowin' that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got like, "What's missin'?"
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed
Real blessed, life has always got me wonderin'
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doin' it right?
Am I hurtin' myself?
Am I wrongin' the ones that love me the most?
What a burden to have
That ain't no way to live
Or maybe it is
Well, maybe it is

[Bridge: Joey Bada$$]
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

[Outro: Joey Bada$$]
This is legendary, it's never secondary
I'm getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
I said, this is legendary, it's never secondary
Getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary



So imma throw this one slow
Just so you can catch the wordplay
Haters gonna hate
But relate to me on my worst day
Girl are turning Patrick Swayze dancing dirty ghost out
Then tell me why im lazy not to call
You're crazy but its cool
I kinda like it without a doubt
My life’s a broken clock so imma make it count
Then dismount the game while i count
All these profits that they made
What a stupid amount
There's people starving in the world while our balances bounce
You understand where I'm coming from
These dungaree youths duel wielding straps like its in their jeans
Run a marathon
Come back again
Shot more green than the amazon
Then rock more gold than the leaders up in the vatican

You understand i’m not rapping for no one
I'm rapping for me a holy flow that was blessed upon me thats why
I don't need an arsenal my words are my gunners
All these man become united when their shooting at brothers
We're governed by the ones who live in crystal palaces
Park an Aston in their villa and sip liquor from chalices
Balance this out
My drive is to focus your doubt then im out
If i'm a flower ready to bloom this song with sprout
Jeez

So many snakes in my head its like Medusa's weave
Butters girls ready to spread can't adam up to eve
Cos even though she took that bite from the fruit we can see
You didn't really fall that far from the tree

I only lie when I sleep
I only lie when I sleep
Rappers misplace their hearts thats why they always off beat
Now they bleat
Cos they’ve been following way before twitter you see
The game’s a flock of sheep and I hate to be bitter but we
Taste the limelight
From hindsight
It changes
We just see the view from the inside
Tinted ranges
Imma write the book
I suggest you turn the pages
Cos i could rearrange the game but I think i need to let it go



[Intro]
While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
I won't let it show

[Verse 1- Tyga]
Nigga, welcome to my life
Life feels like I'm running through a red light
Don't believe what the blogs write
Motherfuckers wanna know me so they call me Mike
I'm just chilling, watching the fight
Few friends, fake girls, pour me some ice
Table glass, slippers on, lower the blinds
Never been shy, I just ignore lies
Take a look into Tyga's eyes
I breathe love but inhale the hate bomb
So numb my face gone, I need my space
And I don't do Facebook
Serious, look how my face look
How could a man cry while the crowd looks?
Could you walk with me if I give you my foot?
Didn't think you could..

[Chorus]
While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
I won't let it show

[Verse 2- Tyga]
I don't wanna feel like most rappers feel when they get a deal
Like, "Yeah, I'm bigger than him, he's still local"
Gotta keep it real cause they will go loco
Like, "He ain't ever go through shit we go through"
So I guess now I owe you
No, now I hold you, watch them niggas close to you
Don't compare careers, his and his fools
Acting like I knew you back in middle school
Dropped out, mama said I was a fool
I brought the drop out, now me and mama cool
Told her I won't lose, showed her a Jimmy Choo
She call me son now, tell me she real proud, smiles
Oh what a feeling to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved
I wish I could fly like a dove

[Chorus]
While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
I won't let it show

[Tyga (speaking)]
Ive learned that people will forget what you say
People will forget what you did or done
But people will never forget how you made them feel
Don't cry because it's over
Smile because it happened

[J Cole]
Cole World, niggas praying for that heat
As the globe twirl gotta stay up on your feet
Before I say it to my girl, I say it to the beat
Then I play it for the world
And they say that shit is deep
My life is changing as we speak
They acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach
I say "peace," hope it ain't no sharks in my water
Then holla at my mama, man she love to see Obama
Do his thing, now look how far niggas done came
They had us on the chains, now we copping bigger chains
I ain't saying that it's smart, old nigga don't trip
But they had with the whips, now we copping bigger whips
Oh shit, wonder how bad will it get before he rise
I'm out here trying to get rich: I survive
And a nigga got God to thank
And I'm still throwing 5 in the tank, nigga COLE!

[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

[Hook]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

[Hook]
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 3]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

[Hook]
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin



5 years ago, we started a journey together. On June 15th, 2009 I released The Warm Up to a few who were waiting patiently for it. Full of my dreams, fears and predictions, it resonated with you right away. Over the next year I watched it grow legs and spread at an unbelievable pace all because you felt it so much. Five years later, I couldn’t be more proud of it’s impact. Thank you.

The Warm Up is a declaration of dedication to Greatness. Told from the perspective of a kid who wants more than what his city has to offer him. The crime. The stagnation. He wants more from the girls he dates. He wants out of Muhammad’s house. He refuses to let anyone tell him he can’t dream. That he won’t make it. He believes in himself. He dedicates his life to his craft, because he’s finally realized that the work that you put in today has a direct and absolute impact on the life you live tomorrow.

You heard the passion, you heard the stories, and you believed in him too. You rooted for him. And your’e still rooting. My thoughts today come from my observations over the past 5 years. I understand now that you’re rooting for him, rooting for me, because you are also rooting for yourself. You realize that this society kills dreams and encourages you to conform. To settle for the block, to join the army, to become a lawyer when you really want to paint, to get comfortable in the projects, to slave away at a 9-5 you hate because it pays decent; to become complacent with safety. The Warm Up says, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”

I think about all the times over the past few years that one of you has said to me, “you’re the reason I went to college,” “yo, The Warm Up got me through some hard times,” “got me through law school,” “med school,” “high school,” “The Warm Up changed my life.”

I imagine that 5 years ago we all wanted more. The Warm Up was just something that put music and words to what we were feeling. As I write this I’m on a plane from Sydney, Australia back to New York City. Music has taken me around the world now, doing shows in places I never thought I would be. I’m grateful.

I’m wondering where you are today. 5 years later. The Warm Up dropped when some of you were upperclassmen in college. I’m hoping that you’ve found a career doing some shit you love, something that makes you happy. Maybe you needed more time to figure it out. Grad School? Or maybe you’re back in your parents crib trying to regroup. Everything will be OK. Don’t stop dreaming.

Some of ya’ll were still in high school. If you went on to college, enjoy it while you got it. If you went straight to the real world, I wish you the best. I hope you found a trade you love, or a job that allows you to support yourself. Happiness is all that matters. If you ain’t happy, adjust please.

Some of you were underclassmen in college, which means you probably just entered the workforce or you’re still trying to get that entry level position. These are the toughest times. You will struggle no doubt, but it will all work out in the end.

No matter where you were 5 years ago, I hope that today you are closer to your dreams. I know that everything hasn’t gone exactly the way you planned, it hasn’t for me either. But our job isn’t to plan. Our job includes 3 responsibilities. 1. To dream. 2. To believe that dream is attainable. And 3. To work hard everyday towards that dream. Let God handle the rest.

As you go throughout this week replaying this project that changed my life and lots of yours too, I want to leave you with this because I feel we all need it. Read this as if these words were yours, because they are.

In 5 years I have come so far. I am grateful to be here today, alive and full of potential. But I am not satisfied. I still want more. I still have dreams, even bigger now than before. I will not settle or conform. I rededicate myself to greatness. I give my time and my passion to my craft, because I realize that the work I put in today affects the life that I live tomorrow. I believe in myself. And to all those that doubt me I say, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”

- Cole



Intro:(Nas and J.Cole)
Freedom or Jail clips inserted
A baby's bein born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end
As far as rap go it's only natural I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name

Verse:
Being myself as I build on my legacy
Enough being someone I'm not I had to rescue me
So many miss functions and wrong ingredients
Put in the game well guess what I got the recipe
Wanted to be my idol get jealous cause I wasn't like him
Any verse or any song he did you name it I'll recite them
I feel as I'm the chosen one Big and PAC form in one
You witnessing a legend in the making yea I told you son,
It's like everything I do other people do it to
It doesn't take long to mimic some else(ayo just be you)
I've been told I'll never do this better then Cole
Be a one hit wonder and never sell more than Hov,
My ambition to get sign plus the intentions
I have in mind is gonna get me far to grab my interest
Death over dishonor bomb the like Osama,
Then damage the charts with a spark no one could put out this fire
If you grip tighter than pliers your chance can still slip away
If it does you best retire cause this kid is on his way
They want me to fall down but I stand my own ground
No excuses for my stupidness I'm sorry to the fam I let you all down!

Outro:
Over look my rivals cause no ones having my title
If you disagree you get JFK snipe with a sniper rifle
My time is now no more holding back in the shadows
I'm a legend in the making passing all of my idols

Heir to the throne

If I'm not the best nigga than I'm the greatest
The thrown is mines nobody stopping me



[intro]
Oh yeah
Ay free my nigga Kota[?} (free my niggas)
My nigga Deep Green (yeah)
Free my nigga Dolla (oh yeah)
Free everybody (everybody) (van dyke)
Joy Road, east side what up
What up big bro
Niggas know
Live life on the edge

[verse 1: J-Solo]
Oh it feel good to be the man
Tell the feds come and catch me if they can
Young nigga gettin' money fast
Fuck slowin' down do the whole dash

[verse 2]
I was raised ramen noodles, kraft mac 'n' cheese
I done sold it all from the drugs even [?]



[verse: Big Herk]
I'm a risk taker
Whatever it take I'm tryna get paper
Down for a get rich quick caper
I just left the wood now I'm bout to hit Schaefer
[?] is dangerous you better move where it's a bit safer
I seen mama let the shit break her
You sellin' what? then i want a lil cut
Like a quick taper
I'm from the murder mitten
Some say the dirty glove
Out here gettin' paper
We be servin' like 30 [?]
Free my man MJ
Told me he was comin' home in May
We was on the block like Dikembe
Dude did 10, coulda told
But he didn't say
Y'all cats rats with your fake ass, Kim K
Everything paid for
I done lost money but I made more
Steppin' on my toes Imma wage war
Now you got a price on your head
They'll kidnap your wife for the bread
Everyday I'm livin'



[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life's a bitch, the type of chick who likes to kiss and tell
I'd like to switch this life, I'm talking to the wishing well
Tired of missions failed
Why do they wish us well?
Know when they wish us L's
This is hell, but i won't cry like little girls
No, I just keep on dreamin' on
Got a plot to be the greatest, it's the top I'm scheming on
Like a doctor, I got patience, I know it won't be that long
So when all your voices gone, man, I'll still be singing on
(Like)
Say I'm a loser, OK, what, cause i'm losing one round?
Oh, now I'm losing my way? Cause my reviews are thumbs down?
I pay no mind, cause I know time is life's windex
So in due time, you'll see clearly just who gon' raise that index
Finger, Let's see who falls like Jenga
Who gets the glory, boy meets world, let's see who gets Topenga
Man, when you losing nobody gon' talk to you like strangers
Look mama, I made it, won't you know it
Everybody speak my language, yeah, yeah



(Verse 1)
Now I lost a lot of hope
Until she came along
They say its way too early
For me to write a song
I'm like let her decide
To say if its right or wrong
I ain't got the Gucci
Not Even Louis Vuitton, but I'll
Give you something better
Something you deserve
You don't ever got worry
You're someone I'll never hurt
Just think about it baby girl
We could be the greatest
While all These bum niggas
Lame bitches just stay hating
Cuz we, both shinning
Your eyes like diamonds
You're the topic to this song
You're the reason why I'm rhyming
So turn off the lights
Called the doubts that you might have
And the bad thoughts must go
So they never come back
I'm telling you dawg
Yo she always on my mind
I'm gone need a map
I get lost in her eyes
She the type of that you
Wana give the world to
And always stick aroun
Matter what The world do
And all the pain the world cause
She be healing that shit
And nah that ain't my girl dawg
But I be feeling that chick
And I just wana give her
Everything she might need
But in the mean time
It's lights please, lights please

(Chorus 8 bars) x2
Lights Please. Lights Please
Turn off the lights
For now everything
Just seems so right
And how you make the darkness
Seem so bright
I'm feeling like
Things gon' be alright

(Verse 2)
Enough of the sweet talk
I'm talking that real
Other niggas chasing you
The way I'm chasing a deal
I love it when I see her
And I hate it when I leave
She call me ugly
Cuz every beauty needs her beast
On top of  this the confidence
My compliments bring
Is that we got more attraction
That's with opposite things
And I give what you want
All these valuable blings
And I'm not like these players
With the obvious schemes, you see I
Met a lot of girls
But none can compare
I would never chose another
You know I would never dare
You could be my everything
My parter in crime
Let both be murderers
And both kill time,  now let me
Take you out
And buy you some flowers
And by the time we come back
The worlds already ours
You already shine
So turn off the lights
I always think about you
As I speak and as I write
To be honest girl
Damn you got me crazy
She want me to call her daddy
As if I'm her little baby
Let me catch up
You're the only one I'm chasing
And all those guys before me
I don't care they don't phase me
Girl you're such a star
Can I get your autograph
You're beautiful and amazing
Trust me that's facts
And I just wana tell her
Everything she might need
But in the mean time
It's lights please, lights please

(Chorus 8 bars)



[Verse 1]
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please

[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"

[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, turn off the lights
Lights, please

[Outro]
Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's "Dead Presidents", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like "yo". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like "Yo", like, "Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come, hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again. Just almost like, just to prove to that nigga and kinda prove to myself that you I can, I can maybe get a little...



[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the life of a nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I'm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I'm fly, I'm a Wright Brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that you could cut and never worry 'bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorized her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her
Y'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don't be appalled man, that nigga was a dog
So it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do that make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Post-Chorus]
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 2]
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it's time to hit the real world, filled with all them résumés and applications
Man, but ain't nobody calling you back
You say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the world on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
'Ey has this world got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had the brake on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, it's just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ain't changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you you'll get the same me

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Post-Chorus]
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 3]
Just like a star that's in my sky
Just like an angel off my page
You have appeard to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and it's been, way too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Hey, uh, still I wonder why
But it ain't what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goin' out my mind
Man, damn

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star



[Intro: J.Cole]
Yeah, Cole world out in the UK
Aww yeah

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
You fucking with the knights of the temple
Mental, how am I successful?
Niggas chose the pen, while I picked up the pencil
Grew up listening to so solid and essentials
Always round P’s like some lentils
Bitch I do you like a weight lifter and hold everything against you
Everything happens like it was meant too
I ain’t tryna sound like a promoter
Bitch I’m tryna sound like Yoda when I say tonight is gonna be eventful
Blackberry, black hat, black sack, black hat, black J’s
Uh, black ring, black snap back, matt black ring, black Audemar Piguet
Uh, black girl, black diamonds, everything black fam, blacker than blade
Uh, leant back, bringing back to back, screaming Rest In Peace, Amy!
Heart goes out to her family my cabinet’s looking fancy
With Brit’s and Ivor Novello’s, I left a space for a Grammy
If it ain’t Adele out in London, I’m with Pharrell in Miami
And fuck around and I go opposite of Mahatma Gandhi, my nigga uh

[Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
You ain’t got enough bottles in your bucket
Bitch you ballin’ on a whole different budget
Like it or love it
Gotta go to drive through to get them nuggets
They gone lose it if they see us out in public
Like it or love it
True a girl that’s badder than Latoya Luckett
And I told her we ain't fucking til she suck it
Like it or love it
(Aww yeah)
Like it or love it

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
I’m saying like it or love it
I weren’t designed for a budget
I got emotional money
I can cry you a hundred
Wipe my eyes with a twenty
Wipe my ass with a fifty
But I get the same attention when I drive through the city
People sayin’ they worry that I’m gettin’ too flash
You know how hard it was to get on Jools fam?
They wanted me to flop so urban never comes back
When under pressure can you handle all that
So the same amount of ice that’s in my rings in my drink
I be filling up my boat, still I pray I never sink
This the realest shit I wrote
Lately I’ve been on a binge
Rocking diamonds in a club can make you feel like a king
Aww yeah!
Ladies surrounding my table
They see my Ralph and thinking that I’m stable
Wan’ see my house but I take ‘em to the same walls
Check in, check out, do you think I’m playing fool?

[Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
You ain’t got enough bottles in your bucket
Bitch you ballin’ on a whole different budget
Like it or love it
Gotta go to drive through to get them nuggets
They gone lose it if they see us out in public
Like it or love it
True a girl that’s badder than Latoya Luckett
And I told her we ain't fucking til she suck it
Like it or love it
(Aww yeah)
Like it or love it

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Impossible, impossible
How many niggas done jocked the flow
Young boy from Fayettenam, how you gon’ tell me not to go?
The south of France we out in Cannes and I ain’t never been on no yacht before
I took the bitch, she went with me, we literally just rocked the boat
Nigga, lock the vault, sewn up, young Simba, grown up
Told y’all I was growing up, now I’m on ya’ll I’ma load up
You was hatin’ me, cops waiting patiently for me to fall gracefully
Know a couple ya’ll couldn’t wait to see
You bitch niggas better own up
Phenomenal, tired of acting like y’all don’t know
Hoes fallin’ like domino
She ain’t fucking she gotta go
Am I wrong cause I got some dough and copped a couple finer things
G-Shock to Rolex, my, how the times have changed!
Life’s better now, might spend a thou’ for a bright sweater
Tell ‘em my price went up now
Had the right set up, ain’t no way I might let up now
Do you know how ill it feel to make a dyke get aroused
Nigga

[Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
You ain’t got enough bottles in your bucket
Bitch you ballin’ on a whole different budget
Like it or love it
Gotta go to drive through to get them nuggets
They gone lose it if they see us out in public
Like it or love it
True a girl that’s badder than Latoya Luckett
And I told her we ain't fucking til she suck it
Like it or love it
(Aww yeah)
Like it or love it



[Intro]
Yeah, uh
Uh, yea
Yea, uh
Fayettenam, nigga
Hahaah uh
Carolina, nigga
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Uh, uh, uh
Nothing but sweat, tears
Just another perspective
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play where killers hung at and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that get gun clap for sneakers
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Who am I trusting?
No time to think about illegal when your stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busting
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
Cause, uh, it wasn't set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)

[Hook]
The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it gets better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)

[Verse 2]
Yea, uh
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto bird circling
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursing them, (fuck)
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We young, black, some strapped
Them whites got they lunch pack for school, we had our guns packed
And all a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
You kill a nigga over beef and cheddar even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest soon
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas still cursin em
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!

[Hook]
The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it get better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)



[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse]
Yeah, ain’t nuttin' to it but to do it, nigga that's true
A quarter milli and a Buick, nigga guess who?
It came to me like the dream that I once had
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you
Clearly, now hear me
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly



Ti ricordi che
Una volta sognare era più facile (più facile)
Di così
Forse ora non mi riconosceresti
Forse una volta per noi sorridere
Non era un limite, per me e te
Vuoi sapere quali sono i miei limiti?
Eh ne ho parecchi
Alcuni che non ti aspetti
Altri ancora che non capiresti
Il primo è il tempo
Che ci rende orgogliosi e vecchi
E si fa sempre notare
Sì perchè il mondo è pieno di orologi e specchi
Poi noi stessi
Che siamo dei confini viventi
Con bandiere dai colori spenti
Vogliamo essere tutti uguali
Con la paura di essere diversi
Se la vita è un viaggio dovrai fermarti in più stazioni
Quando corri non pensi alle pulsazioni
Schiavi delle ansie, cicatrici per le frustrazioni
A volte i tuoi limiti, sono i tuoi miti, non sei tu se li imiti
Fingono di essere ribelli
E poi stanno lì miti
I miei incubi riuniti si dividono le mie notti
Mentre penso che è assurdo
Ma è quando si perde tutto che si è forti
Non ricordi?
Quando ci siamo incontrati ho pensato "Quanti anni saranno passati?"
Due chiacchiere di circostanza e siamo subito ritornati passanti
Mentre ti guardavo pensavo a noi che giocavamo
Senza pensare al futuro
Ora che sono cresciuto scrivo 'sti pensieri come se importasse a qualcuno ma...

[Rit.]
Ti ricordi che (che)
Una volta sognare era più facile (più facile)
Di così
Forse ora non mi riconosceresti
Forse una volta per noi sorridere
Non era un limite
Per me e te
Per me e te
Era più facile (piùùù)
Più facile

Se parlo dei miei limiti non saranno mai più limiti
Ma è solo per dire che nelle difficoltà
Che siamo più simili
Io che scrivo questi pezzi come se fossero lettere senza destinatario
Tu respira piano
È nella tempesta e non col mare calmo che di solito scopri un bravo marinaio
Chi cera di costruire
È più quello che distrugge
Cerco l'ispirazione ma spesso mi sfugge
La rincorro in una strada senza luce
E la trovo a terra come un angelo, ma è senza piume (è senza piume)
Per ritrovarmi lascio sui fogli parole sparse
Mentre i fulmini cercano il ferro nel mio sangue
Quando ci rincontreremo, quanti anni saranno passati?
Due chiacchiere di circostanza e torneremo di nuovo passanti
Mentre ti guardavo pensavo a noi che giocavamo, senza pensare al futuro
Ora che sono cresciuto scrivo 'sti pensieri come se importasse a qualcuno ma...

Ti ricordi che
Una volta sognare era più facile (più facile)
Di così
Forse ora non mi riconosceresti
Forse una volta per noi sorridere
Non era un limite, per me e te



[Intro: Sample]
Do you still believe in love?
Or do you like drugs?

[Verse 1: Bas]
Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary, Fiend

[Hook: Bas]
It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?

[Verse 2: Bas]
She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say "Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking
Stand back, catch my amazing graces
Photo finish and fornication
Photo finish and fornication, fiend

[Hook: Bas]
It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?

[Bridge 1: KQuick]
Feel the buzz
Can you feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz, ohh-whoa, yeah
Do you believe in love?
What's your drug? What's your drug?
Ohh-whoa

[Bridge 2: J. Cole]
Take it all the way from the beginning
Yea, yea, yea
Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that lets people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that...

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, um world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'
He made it rappin', now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
(It's lit, feel the buzz?)
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
That's deep

[Outro: Bas]
Feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz?



[Intro]
Disappear (ghost)

[Verse 1: Salomon Faye]
My mind spills to thrills and fills the void, kills the noise
You know the game build, destroy, Tetris
Before you turn the phone off but then the phone dies
There's no break for a black guy
Blacklisted before they even wrote shit
Mad gifted before we even spoke the word
In the beginning, it was just a word and the word was with God and the word was Allah
Voilà but it ain't magic niggas die but it ain't tragic
Its more natural new birth
What if heaven is the new Earth?
What if God is a bluebird, that can't fly because it knows itself as the sky?
I used to see rain as the proof I can cry with no fear, but now I gotta hide my own tears so I don't seem weak
I don't even want to see me cause I don't know that nigga
I don't owe that nigga
To tell the truth, something to show that nigga
That's why I love you because I know who you are
That's why I look at you like I seen you before
I recognize you from a hole in the wall
That I punched in the wall because I'm so pissed off
I meditate and try to calm myself
I know anger only harm myself
False alarm myself
So many books I read to warn myself
I want more myself
Look at in the mirror and I scorn myself
Who am I?
And am I really even here?
I think it's time for me to disappear

[Chorus: Salomon Faye & J. Cole]
Cause I've been living way too long in the right or the wrong
I'm as small as a fly with the shit that I'm on
So get going get lost
I don't want to be found
You won't see me if you looking around
Cause I've been living way too long in the right or the wrong
I'm as small as a fly with the shit that I'm on
So get going get lost
I don't want to be found
You won't see me if you looking around

[Post-Chorus: Eryn Allen Kane]
Feel my pain
Feel my pain, feel my force walk into the flame
It will change you of course
Don't be scared, I will be there where you are
You don't know
It's ok where you go

[Verse 2: Salomon Faye]
Yesterday I saw the ending of the end
And I'm in it again
Everything is on spin, I'm just caught in the wind
Protectless, breathless, stress less
The high got the Faye kinda restless
Second guessing intent directions
I get a kick out of the irony of my blessings
Humerous in life, enormous as my sacrifice so it seems
Then again [?]
But a dollar and a dream and a model for the team
Or a slogan for the soul
How you living your just another soldier right?
What I'm fighting for don't even know what I'm writing for
Man this ain't even real life no more
I'm on the edge and I got nothing but a song
I'm lucky if the birds sing along

[Chorus: Salomon Faye & J. Cole]
Cause I've been living way too long in the right or the wrong
I'm as small as a fly with the shit I'm on
So keep going get lost
I don't want to be found
You won't see me if you looking around
Cause I've been living way too long in the right or the wrong
I'm as small as a fly with the shit I'm on
So keep going get lost
I don't want to be found
You won't see me if you looking around

[Post-Chorus: Eryn Allen Kane]
Feel my pain
Feel my pain, feel my force walk into the flame
It will change you of course
Don't be scared, I will be there where you are
You don't know
It's ok where you go



[Intro]
(Howlin', howlin')
Howlin' in the night better get it right
(Yeah we, yeah we)
Yeah we see the light and it brings delight
(Lookin', lookin')
Lookin' at the moon and we come alive
(Come and, Come and)
Come and fuck with us we the young and bright

So bitch sit down, bow to the crown
We don't wanna put another man in the ground
It's the sac town, the love goes around, But
(Are you, are you)
Are you gonna fuck with the sound? Huh?!

[Refrain]
(Well if I can spend the twenty on jack and make it back to the dorm by the morning Ima be alright)x2

[Verse]
So here we are so bizarre, like the czar
Then he come and make some hits then he gone, Barry Bonds
But I never did no wrong with a beat or a song, its just
Sometimes you don't have to sing along, just listen I'm lifted

But all the different people at the party acting shifty
And I don't talk to people when I'm focused I'm busy
Pulling influence from others when I'm making history
So you don't have to sing along yeah just listen

[Outro]
(Just listen, Yeah, just listen) x4
What's the last song you play before you die?
What's the last song you play before you die?
What's the last song you play before you cry?
What's the last song you play before you die?



[Intro: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Re-Up Gang Pusha
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (yes!)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch, have my son before I face that tragedy
Uhh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse, gone!

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (yeah, yeah)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, uh, for the followin'
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modellin'
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing, cause when you chase the pussy
It’s a sin, but if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin'
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
CyHi! Yeah! Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m runnin through them circles boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings so trust me, dawg, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothin’ silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

[Interlude: Big Sean & Kanye West]
G.O.O.D., I do it
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
B-I-G, Sean Don, nigga
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (bitch!)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I’m in, that no-smoke sec' rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers
New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dyin'
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Yo bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, e’rybody can get it
When you’re this hot, e'rybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, e'rybody’s a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from, quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch, and you don’t want no problems
On some math class shit so check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' ’bout
What you been praying fo'? What you been screamin' ’bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout



[Intro - Yo Gotti]
6 in the morning, I’m gonna call Wale
Tell J. Cole meet us down in the A
And bring Wiz Khalifa cause the green look pure
We some real niggas
We just looking in the mirror

[Hook]
I'm on fire, whole hood blazing
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazing
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look's like a chandelier, look in the mirror
Eyes super clear, you looking in the mirror
Who you heard see when you look in the mirror?
If you a real nigga, you looking in the mirror

[Verse 1 - Wale]
D.C. all up in this bitch
Bout time I got my respect
And now these hoes are on my line
Like Sally Mae on college debt
Gotti here, I’m in this shit
Here's your nigga, come hear this year
I bet you hear that white music
But I don’t mean Top 40 hits
Talk to the mirror
And I don’t need a cure
And when I’m done with this muthafucker
You’ll need an urn
Shopping I’ll be in Paris
Plottin' don’t even worry
You walk in my closet your favorite stylist will be emburrsed
You out where, we don't ever see ya
My niggas out here, they spot me like Chippy D
And I’m probably smoking reefer til I got that emphysema
How else can I emphasize I’ll only let the mirror see ya

[Yo Gotti]
It go microphone check, one, two, yola
Two chains, two guns, he bipolar
Two baby mamas, 3 kids, two Rovers
That's too many problems, too late to think over
The cars off the showroom, the clothes off the mannequin
Hoes out the centerfold, I be going in at em
One bitch from Howard, another bitch from Grambling
College girl going wild, we gonna need a camera man
Bird talk feather man, Louie jacket leatherman
Fresh to death that bullshit irrelevant
Man in the mirror, I can’t get my shot again
My bitch like a coke bottle, your bitch like a Pepsi can

[Hook]

[J. Cole]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Bitch, I was born to ball
While you took the summer off my money did a somersault
Backflips, cartwheels, Carolina Tar Heel
Ain't no nigga touching my style, it got a force field
Magneto, blew up like a torpedo
The view from my condo make hoes say "neato!"
Game strong like the arm on Marino
I stack Cheetos and Doritos like casinos
Fresh to death like I’m buried in a tuxedo
At times I look in the mirror to boost my fucking ego
I say it’s your World, Cole World to be exact
With a flow that’s so thorough, no sir you can’t re-enact

[Wiz Khalifa]
150 on my chain
Balling, but it’s not a game
High: that's why they call us planes
All the bitches know my name
I take em home, fuck her, get high and never call again
And my niggas all the same
Now that's what you call a game
Hundred thousand dollars and that’s on champagne
Bitches choosing their excuses: my new car’s to blame
Wanna dump a nigga, fuck a nigga with a lot of fame
Don’t want nothing from a nigga; he all kinds of lame
Try doing what you doing but it’s out of range
Niggas taking shots, don’t know how to aim
Don’t know bout you but I see a real nigga
When I’m looking in the mirror
With some diamonds in my ear muthafucker



[Verse 1]
Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hoping this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell them "go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let them OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it

[Hook]
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip, don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on
Don't lose your balance
Don't lose your balance

[Verse 2]
I look around at my city, this is SinVille
That boy eleven-years-old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul I asked it "When will, this shit change? "
It said boy "Just use them pen skills"
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh

[Hook]
Yeah, and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance
Don't slip don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
Don't lose your balance
Don't lose your balance

[Verse 3]
I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'mma sucka for love I guess
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame em' did the same when I saw the ass
Match with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped

[Hook]
I think I'm losing my balance, yea uh
I think I'm losing my balance, yea uh
She got me Losing your balance
She got me Losing your balance uh, yea
But I won't slip, I won't fall
Just a get a grip and hold on
Losing my balance
Losing my balance



[Intro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?
Uh

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life—is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit… You ain't shit, nigga!"

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion (Uh)
But what about your seed, nigga? (Uh-uh)
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?

[Outro]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it



[Intro: J. Cole]
Heh, oh yeah, yeah
Gon' turn me up some more
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Got a young chick from the hood, Southside
Pops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit she was up against
Little did he know the shit was gon' backfire
Cause she act quiet, got baptized
Sang in the choir, but the thing she desired
Was a older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girl's in heat, it's deep
She sneaking out, off the leash
On the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out, he kicked her out
She living on her own and it's vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room
And I'm thinking of the best way to kick her out
It's cold

[Hook: Fabolous]
Cause all she ever talks about is Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo
I said Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I told the bitch somebody stole my Rollie
She talking 'bout "Me too"
I came through with the brand new Louis bag
She talking 'bout "Me too"
L.A. on my next flight, you guessed right
She saying "Me too"
Now everybody meet Ms. Me Too
Goddamn, be you
And if that is you, you so shallow
You're on a boat that won't travel
Won't float and won't paddle
If I go broke, it won't matter
This stupid ass shit don't make me
I been poor, it won't break me
You're so caught up on material shit
We both knowing that you can't even get

[Hook: Fabolous]
I mean Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis, Louis

And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
She was standing at the baggage claim
First thought: "Gotta bag this dame"
Not knowing she was one of them
"Check what your baggage name" types
Anyway, I'm happy that it came off the belt
Damier joint same as the belt
She look like she came on herself
Shorty, you should be ashamed of yourself
I'm checking out her cute face, thin little waist line
She checking out my suitcase, like the bitch half canine
Could've took her number, but hat'd be like taking bad advice
When you look at her, you're looking at a price
As I walked away, she said "That's a nice..."

[Hook: J. Cole]
Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo
I mean Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
You know the ones that'll order the lobster
Go for the champagne
Don't care what you do, but you better do the damn thing
If you wanna win the campaign
Cause her company just ain't cheap
What y'all probably ain't peep
You can't keep a shallow bitch if your pockets ain't deep
So I try to be slick, ain't reserve no dinner
Ain't take her to the club, had her meet me at the bar
Let her walk in, peep her from afar
Gotta let her know, can't keep her in the dark
Cause she will run the tab up if you let her
And I thought I knew better
'Til she say "Let me start with a double shot
Hey, bartender, let me get a..."

[Hook: J. Cole]
Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo
I mean Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo

Aye just in case you didn't know that

I can't fuck with her no more man

My freaks go down
Nigga I can’t fuck with her no more
Ayo, ayo…

[Verse 3]
Dude got a rich bitch, though
She off the chain, ready to go
Baddest thing, head to toe
Fine line between a rock star and just a ho
But she walked that
Goddamn, girl, she walked that
Big money talk real loud
I mean I can barely talk back
But I, but I got good game, good game
Nothing like them lames you used to
I know the rules gon’ use you
I just want the same shit that you do
Can you keep a secret?
Sometimes, man, your beeper leak it
Nigga told me she evil
I danced with the devil then, please believe it
Please believe it

[Hook]
She take my hip-hop, ayo

You can't keep a shallow bitch if your pockets ain't deep
So I try to be slick, ain't reserve no dinner
Ain't take you to the club, had her meet me at the bar
Let her walk in, peep her from afar
Gotta let her know, can't keep her in the dark
Cause she will run the tab up if you let her
And I thought I knew better
'Til she say "Let me start with a double shot
Hey, bartender, let me get a..."

[Hook: J. Cole + Fab talking]
Aye just in case you didn't know that
That Louis XIII is like $150 a shot
I can't fuck with her no more man



[Intro: Rita Ora]
Ah-ahaaa-ahaah
Ah-ahaaa-ahaah
Ah-ahaaa-ahaah

[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
There's somethin' 'bout you I can’t explain
You give me love and take it away
I see you like this game that we play, ay, ay, ay, ay
And yo, this fightin' shit is gettin' too old
And you gon' find yourself left out in the cold
It’s time to straighten up or you can move on, on, on, on, yeah

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (J. Cole)]
(Yeah, it’s something crazy 'bout the way we love to hate each other)
I don’t wanna fight anymore
(Every day we fightin' like the navy, baby, maybe we can save each other)
I don’t wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off and you mad all for nothin'
I don’t wanna fight anymore
Can’t we just make love and not war?

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Baby, somethin' about you
You got that good shit I don’t wanna give up
It’s too good to give it away, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah, I feel like we’re just comin' too close
Who’s wrong or right? This is outta control
I’m not perfect, but I’m tired of this bullshit
Let's move on

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (J. Cole)]
(Yeah, it’s something crazy 'bout the way we love to hate each other)
I don’t wanna fight anymore
(Every day we fightin' like the navy, baby, maybe we can save each other)
And I don’t wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off and you mad all for nothin'
I don’t wanna fight anymore
Can’t we just make love and not war?

[Bridge: J. Cole & (Rita Ora)]
White flag (Ah-ahaaa-ahaah)
White flag (Ah-ahaaa-ahaah)
I’m waving a white flag (Ah-ahaaa-ahaah)
White flag, baby

[Bridge: Rita Ora]
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, boy
I don’t wanna fight anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, boy
I don’t wanna fight anymore

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (J. Cole)]
(Yeah, it’s something crazy 'bout the way we love to hate each other)
I don’t wanna fight anymore
(Every day we fightin' like the navy, baby, maybe we can save each other)
I don’t wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off and you mad all for nothin'
I don’t wanna fight anymore
Can’t we just make love and not war?
(Yeah, it’s something crazy 'bout the way we love to hate each other)
I don’t wanna fight anymore
(Every day we fightin' like the navy, baby, maybe we can save each other)
I don’t wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off and you mad all for nothin'
I don’t wanna fight anymore
Can’t we just make love and not war?



It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 1]
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’mma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit remember I was straying from home
And "Where I Wanna Be" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone

[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 2]
She know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don’t mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy don’t please my ass
If shit was on the other foot then you would leave my ass
Ay, True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal and you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try justify thinkin', man we finna be rich
While some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks

[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not



[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

KAM WORLD....GOT COLE WORLD ON THE CHORUS BABY

(Chorus)

Does she love me? Damn it I don't know it
But if she does, she doesn't show it
Should I approach her and possibly blow it?
Nah, I know she'll recognize a guy like me, man she can't ignore it
It's not that I love her, It's just feels right
If anything I'm more curios as to what that throat feels like
All I need is one chance to show you a real nice, a chill night
Because I know you know you appeal right?
I see these dudes rapping bout a girl that dont love'em
Little do they know while she with me she. dont think of'em
Bet that probably got'em sick now they hurtin
Cuz all that time you were putting in workin
Her heart was where I was at for certain
Now yall emotions all exposed like an open curtain Im sorry ..ha none of that
And you dont wanna know what kept her coming back
I went deep in her hole and had'er sprinting downhill like a runningback
Well exercised and I kept her walls intact

(Chorus)

Why this beat make me wanna write right now
Oh that's right I gotta write my rights right now
Sit down Uh freedom dead ever since pac dead good thing he alive Count my blessing 1-5 while I'm high-high five honey boo boo not a Bee sweeter than a beehive Money drugs and violence torchered by my honey hugs and violins each time I ain't got wings on me yet but they say he fly Oh my I'm on another level gypsies in my temple Royalty assembles Crystals on the grounds than Crystal in the clouds let go Nother world nother state and I ain't even leave past Michigan state Talkin bout that mental state Bet you can't relate Who's swimming with the fishes who's floating like parades Nah we sitting down writing rhymes superstars in our eyes Ayee New world order Can I take your order I got the recipe to the remedy for endlessly living before we rest in peace Rest in power Rest In paradise You can't have all of them unless you an O.G. oh God Scary heights Very high



[Intro]
Love yours
Love yours
No such thing

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived



[Speech]
Ion think y'all really understand... how much this shit means to means to me, man y’all just-
I'm back home and y'all just sat through my whole fuckin’ entire album and shit that's fuckin' crazy, thank y'all for doing that shit man
I been planning this night for a long time so this shit is- crazy to see like- turning to reality and shit
And I appreciate y'all for sitting through this shit I want to tell y'all some shit
About this album so when you leave here tonight-
I know people been- people been telling me niggas playing the album like crazy and I appreciate it but
But we leave here tonight, I want y'all to know what this album meant to me
So when you driving home
And you playing it this week, next week, next year, whenever
You gon' always remember what this shit is about
What I had to go out into the world and learn- on my own
I’m coming here to tell y’all tonight this is what this album is about
And I'm taking this message across the fuckin’ world ion' care
Here it go:
When we young
And even when we old
The world is constantly, constantly pumping us with images, and messages, about what life is about right, and what- what we need to make us happy
In the United States, we call it the American Dream right
But what does it always include?
A lot of fucking money
A big ass house
A brand new car
A wife that's not even genetically fuckin' possible to have and shit
And bitches
And bitches too
They tell us we need all that to be happy right
So what ends up happening?
The world is setup so that 99% of us can’t live like that, but what do we do?
We idolize the people that do live like that right?
We call them celebrities
We follow they lives
We go "oh man it looks so perfect, I want to be living like them"
And I'm coming here tonight to tell y'all I'm the same dude
That was on the other side of the fence, right here in this city, right down the fuckin' street working at the fucking skating rink daydreaming
Oh y'all niggas love the skating rink
Daydreaming about shit like "Man I want to live like that, I want that" right?
And then I went and got that shit
But I'm telling y'all this
I'm not saying that to stunt, I'm saying that to say this
When I got over there, on that side of the fence, and I started to look closer I'm telling y'all
As not fuck J. Cole I'm telling y'all as Jermaine
As I really started to take a closer look at all that shit we want, and all the shit we need that makes us happy
I started to see for my, with my own eyes like wait a minute
That shit don't feel right, that shit feel weird
And I started to notice that, all of that shit that they tried to tell us is all bullshit and it's all wrong and it's not what we need to make us happy
I had to go figure that shit out on my own
And how do I know that?
How do I know that?
This is how I know that
It's a man right now in the world, he got millions of fucking dollars, he got a billion fuckin' dollars right
He got everything that we think we need to be happy, he got it
He got the money, he got the cars, he got the big ass crib, 3 or 4 of them bitches, he got the genetically impossible wife, and he got bitches. But yet, this dude is fucking miserable right, he's empty inside, he's miserable
But you got a family, that comes from where we come from, from this city right here, worse conditions than what we come from
They couldn't afford to a ticket to this show tonight if they fucking wanted one right?
But yet somehow, they got more happiness and joy in their life right now than this man will ever have in his life
How is that possible?
How's that even possible?
He got everything they told us we need to be happy and he's miserable
And they ain't got shit
But they happy
What do they got that he don't got?
(Love)
What's that?
(Love!)
That's that fuckin' Cumberland County public education system there coming into play Goddammit
I need everyone to put your cell phones in the sky one time tonight Fayetteville we gonna light this shit up one time
Ay yo
A nigga been dreaming about this shit

[Intro]
Love yours
Love yours
No such thing

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
Cause what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: ? & YG]
No matter, baby, I don't hurt you
I know that, baby, I won't let you down
I know that I need you (Oh no)
Know that, baby
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
She gon' ride so I know she love me (She loyal)
And she pretty so you know she spoiled (Know she spoiled)
I give her diamonds, treat her like she royal (Like she royal)
I just can't wife her, I ain't tryna worry (Tryna worry)
Chef in the kitchen, cook it like it's curry (Like it's curry)
I can't tote that Glock, if it ain't got a 30 (Got a 30)
Getting head in the foreign, that bitch got me swervin' (She got me swervin')
And I'm never nervous (Never nervous), all my bitches perfect
...
Yeah

[Chorus: J. Cole & Lil Duke]
She gon' ride yeah (She gon' ride yeah)
And she perfect (And she gorgeous)
Give her diamonds (I give her diamonds)
I can't wife her (I just can't wife it)
Chef is cooking (Cooking, yeah)
I can't to–



[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name

[Hook: J. Cole (Sampled)]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

[Verse: Nas]
I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is hauntin'
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
'Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas, just bein' nasty, nigga
Military hat, fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up
Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor, Arm and Hammer
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer
Yet still bein' my mama's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warnin'
Global warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'
That's some advice I never got
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock
While you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time
Now I'm playin' Born Sinner loud, saw you live, rock the crowd
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud

[Bridge: Nas]
So you ain't let Nas down
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga
You ain't let Nas down
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin', nigga
You ain't let Nas down

[Outro: Nas]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end



[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Maine on fire, my empire be higher
Than an octave on Mariah, you niggas should worship sire
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars
I was David promising the world that I'mma serve Goliath
Then I swam with sharks, made it to the land and parked
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as satan's worst desires
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo
Get my head out the window
20k in my pocket as im feeling the wind blow
And I ain't have a wallet since Nintendo, comprendo
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo
I used to wanna save the world, now all I do is spend dough
Till I snap back like Hov hat
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that

[Hook]
Maine on fire
Top down bitch i ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Maine on fire
Every week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots many bottles pop
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

[Verse 2]
We collect a hundred thou
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now
I was such a cunning child
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you
The one your mama glad you hung around
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor, nigga
But its just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas
We just let the paper blind us
While vaginas chase behind us
Take notes make money don't make jokes
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats
Real shit but if the world really bout to end
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again

Huh

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Omen]
Tryna follow my intuition as I’m on this million dollar mission
Mama told me I was special, thank God I listened
My environment never let me be a pretender
Similar interest with them dope boys but I was different
The hoop dreaming lonely child, hung around Hyde Park, Chatham and the Stony Isle
Pimps, players, gang wars, living in a lonely town
Who can I relate to?
Feeling like the Golden child, Chi city culture
Full of pain, full of soul singers
Dead bodies in our rivers but their souls linger
A young black man living with unrealistic dreams
But luckily I’ve seen some unrealistic things
A child from the city took the good route
Always fit in and always stood out, complex
Layered, rather show you than say it
Though I know my greatness is always understated
Mama working 12 hours days on her feet
Coming home, cooking dinner, made her son wanna weep
My step father working while I’m zoning the beats
Meanwhile my biological was roaming the streets
Tryna be an entertainer, but my heart held love, no anger
He out there tryna be a singer
I guess this just the life I was made for

[Hook]
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that (yeah)

Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that (yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, truly yours, J. Cole
My mama coulda been a movie star
You know like Judy Garland
I went to St. Johns, I coulda went to Juliard
Cause my beautiful mind mixed with my musical bond
Deep as a funeral line, dawg, I get it from my mama
I used to be embarrassed getting picked up in that Honda
Thought my niggas might play me if they found out that my mama was a white lady
So like gravy, had to cover that
Plus my older brother black but he look white
In an all black school, picture what that look like
No wonder he was under-achieving, not believing in himself
Coming home, just be keeping to himself
Looking back through the silence, he was screaming out for help
Maybe this verse can find the words to get the demons out himself
So yeah, I’m exercising
Right now my record climbing, I’m sort of a stair master
Niggas got there faster, I took the long route, I never been a scared rapper
Boy this ain't Fear Factor, they tell me can you hear the wrath spilling out these paragraphs
Made the world clear a path
Bet I’ll be on top from now till the hereafter
I'm special, mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
You know I love her for that
That's right, I’m special

[Hook]
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
You know I love her for that
You know I love her for that

[Omen - Verse 3]
Tell me, whats the marketing plan for realness?
What’s the demographic target audience for brilliance?
What's the first week numbers for my inspiration?
Who can A&R this passion and this dedication
Name: Omen
This ain't a verse, this a revelation
We need some more Sanaa Lathan’s in our population
I’m meeting women I would never date
The kind that say they want a marriage, but they really want a wedding day
I’m seeing groupies tryna act like they don’t notice me
But the writings on the wall call it hoetry
Desire calls, but that's not what my focus be
Music’s forever my lady unlike Jodeci
See when a leader's speaking, you should simply follow suit
I stay in the zone like it’s college hoops, let me show you how to shoot
You know aim for the goal, these are just the chronicles
They're calling me the Honorable, though I am not no Muslim
I’m finna blow like woodwinds, tricky like a good sin
I’m something you’ve mistooken, mistaked him for fakeness
Haters don’t know what you facing
Oh goodness, oh gracious
They looking at greatness
I was special, mama told me I was special

[Hook]
Mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that (yeah)
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that (yeah)

Gotta love her for that (yeah)
Gotta love her for that (yeah)
Gotta love her for that
Gotta love her for that (yeah)
Gotta love her for that (yeah)
Mama told me I was special



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah
On one hand, I'm happy for her
Because she smilin'
And I think about the times that she smiled for me
On the other hand, I'm bitter and well
Inside I'm dyin'
'Cause she loves him and she ain't got no time for me
And her new boyfriend is so clever
Over heard a couple of her friends tellin' her he better than me
And despite all the spite that builds with each passing night
I can't help but think they right
Because he never did cheat (Never did cheat, true)
And there is no excuse I can use
And there are no words I could say to make you believe
That I did this for us
Now I'm back on the mission
Tryna get what's mine
I gotta have her but this nigga here's in my way
What he don't know
From a 1 to 10 that girls a dime
No disrespect but when I met her dawg she was a four
I taught her everything she know

[Verse 2: Treasure Davis]
I remember when
We were lovers and friends
Friends till the end
But now you're back again
'Cause you see me with him
And it's wearing you thin

[Bridge: Treasure Davis]
Funny how the tables turned
Played your cards now watch it burn
Karma cuts so deep
It starts to burn
Now what you really sorry for?
I lost track of keeping score
Sick of all the back and forth
So now I gotta know for sure
Yeah

[Chorus: Treasure Davis & J. Cole]
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
That's all I wanted to hear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
How did it all disappear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me baby

[Verse 3: Treasure Davis]
Baby honestly this is so hard for me
'Cause you're where I wanna be
Yeah
Yeah he treats me right
But you make love to my mind
You be my permanent high

[Bridge: Treasure Davis]
Funny how the tables turned
Played your cards now watch it burn
Karma cuts so deep
It starts to burn
Now what you really sorry for?
I lost track of keeping score
Sick of all the back and forth
So now I gotta know for sure
Yeah

[Chorus: Treasure Davis & J. Cole]
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
That's all I wanted to hear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
How did it all disappear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I fucked up, I ain't gon' lie
Tryna get a piece of that apple pie
Oh
I fucked up, I ain't gon' lie
Finally got a piece of that apple pie
Hey
I hit the road, came back home
Note on the table saying she was gone
Tears smear the words saying, "I can't wait"
Found somebody else hope it's not too late

[Chorus: Treasure Davis & J. Cole]
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
That's all I wanted to hear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
How did it all disappear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
Say that you love me (Say it, baby)
Say that you love me (Say it, baby)
Say that you love me



[Verse 1: Therapist]
Yo you up on some shit fuck
Cuz every word I utter's intent you faggot
Fucking with this is like punching cement
I know your type, you bluffing with tough talk you scared to brawl
Never stepping but your mouth is running marathons
Its hopeless, I'm focused, I won't miss
Any foes want to oppose get your throats slit
You can't call it, I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learnt from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit (get it? Damn)
Know this even if your voice is deep
Niggas sufferin' from arthritis they joints is weak
Know if cats know where the motherfuckin' turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo funny how tables turn and life pays your dues
Earn your stripes, never be concerned with ice cuz check it out
The more money you pay for rent, is just givin' me even more reason to take this shit
The main event, servin' niggas the way y'all run through these herds with these words is distrubin' niggas
So leave it alone, I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
No need to play games I'm in a league of my own
Its therapist niggas, dismiss you dick kissers, for you to get bigger than shits slimmer than stick figures
You faggots can't stand how much love I get, but if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm taking over, I got what it takes to make it over the top you trynna diss me to stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feeling the most stepped on stage got arrested for stealing the show mothafucka

Yo my brain in the forecast, Therapist broadcast Philly to North tax(?) you really don't want that
Therapist and meddafore niggas remeber the name remember tha Game niggas



[Tones]

Sometimes the effort that you put in is less than what you get back
Always room for failure in this life, can't regret that
It only makes you stronger when the day really burn
The undeniable greatness got me feeling up
Who the fuck ain't feeling um, you just feeling mad cuz you ??
Fuck your money too, that dollar's Illuminati
I came up off of Hip-Hop, real shit back in the day
Why you wannabes think I'm rapping is ??
I know the pain that I speak of is deeper than your grass
Just take a second to listen, that's all I got to ask
Surrounded by this trash and I'm getting overlooked
Write a hook for a g, pay for a show you got booked
6-3-1 , 6-3-9 , 1-9-40
That's my number all you fucks can just call me
Destroy wannabes, invite me to your friend's party
For a g I'll burn him in front of his own mommy
I'm nasty, when I tell ya I can never lose
These words I from a selection in which I some and choose
This is what legends do, I'm light years gone
Close your eyes anytime you hear this song

[Coast]

What's the difference if you listen to the garbage they prescripting you
And see inside the demons and the leeches when I spit the truth
It's sickness that is lifting you from off your feet to hit the roof
Inside you'll find the evil in these feeble minded ???
Deceitful lies and simple proof that even I could think is true
If you were looking back at all the facts that these bitches knew
If ignorance is innocence, then innocence you're all wrong
I see it in your faces, that's the place they rest their pulse on
So you can tell your lies and then decide you might believe it
But I've arrived to find I declined to hide your secrets
What I provide is genius, my lines inside a secrets
Designed to make you vibe whenever you decide to peep this
And that's just what the speed is so you should try and catch up
Hit you where you breathing, it freezes from the neck up
No disrespect son but my intention is deadly
Carving out your heart with the sharpest machete
I see inside your rhymes and all the lies you try to sell us
Suck out a feeling that you're fabricated over zealous
Statements that you make are just your fake imagination
An attempt to validate your alter state and miscreation
You expect me to believe your deceitful ways and fakery
Your measurement of my intelligence is just amazing me
How stupid can you take me for, if anything I'm maybe more
If life is just a game then you ain't acting like we played before
Me I got the greatest score, dominating take the sport
Filling up the pages in your record book, I came for more
Than what you clowns is giving me, we just sounding different G
My I'm on something other shit, you just ride a dick and freeze

[Tabs]

I felt something in my soul, back when I was younger
No matter what I tried I couldn't satisfy the hunger
Now all these rappers hide cuz my battle cries thunder
The illest cat alive still I agonize to wonder
Would I ever make a move that was major
Actualize the dreams of my youth, see the fruits of my labor
Will there ever be a million people screaming Bad Karma
Or is this another opportunity I have squandered
Had to look deep inside my soul to find the truth within
Now it's maneuvering and exulting through the skin
You have been formally introduced to my hunger pains
Went from 'What's his name' to Tabs One but nothing changed
It corrupts my brain when I see your weak schemes
What we've seen is quite rare, makes nightmares to sweet dreams
I got a street team but we don't put posters up
We kick open doors that all of these frauds have closed and shut
So roll a dutch and toast to Big L, to Big L
I must love Hip-Hop cuz I ain't got shit else
I'm in hell and there ain't even a slight breeze
So I light trees and look to the right like mic please

[Hook - Tabs]
Mic please, pass me the mic
That's what I been waiting for, for all my life
I will never fall, I will brawl and fight
Just pass me that shit and it will be alright
[5x]

Mic please, just pass me the mic...



[Intro]
Ayy, yeah
That new Rihanna shit
That new Rihanna shit
Look

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Verse 1]
I guess they know that I'll cut a bitch
Boy, I'm already paid, getting money for the fuck of it
I'm on some other shit
So if you fly, what am I, do that make me the mothership?
Beam me up ho, they wanna see a nigga down
Take his crown, we be up doe, yeah we be up ho!
Now hit the ground, bow down to the sound
Good God

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Verse 2]
I guess they know that I'll cut a ho
Yeah I cleaned up good but I'm still out the gutter though
Don't forget this shit
You gotta problem? Then meet me outside if you with the shit

But bitch, I'm way past nigga rich
Good God

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way

[Verse 3]
Cole World, used to stay off his dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old-ass Laker
But I ain't come to talk about all that paper
That's what they talk about when they ain't got shit to say
Can't understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know they sayin' same shit, nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cuz on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows, hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish n' chips
Why I do a lot of shows, I'm the shit that's it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes, word to Cliff and Chris
If I fuck six bitches I got six assists

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way

That new Rihanna shit bump
That new Rihanna shit bump



[Intro]
Ah!
Playing With Fire 4
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you man are gassed lay off the pedal
Get off my dick and get on my level
I'm back on the road, I’m tapping my horns
I'm tapping my horns so watch for the devil
I'm blowing off steam, you turned on the kettle
I’m carrying heat, I'm made out of metal
Sleep on me for any much longer your funeral just gone be you and your pillows
The time is N-O-W, N-O-W
You just don't K-N-O-W, or your too S-L-O-W
To know I'm B-L-O-W I-N-G U-P right under you
J-A-N don't be them other dudes
J-A-N he beat them other dudes
Ain't come here to be no number two
Well take that back I'm the shit and
Your bitch fall for me like quicksand
I told that bitch I'm like Mo Farah
I just work better with distance
I put in overtime, I go over lines, I ain’t organized
Fuck a 9-5, dodged a suit and tie, I get scrutinized but it’s cool I'm fine I
What if I was to die and met the devil in heaven, and hell had my reverend
Or there was just nothing at all, and we wish the times that we had were more cherished
And they say that life sweet like cherry pie
But this shit like primary cause you don’t know who said what or
What was who and who is you and
You is me and I is you?
No wonder as kids were confused
When the sky turn pink and the fields turn blue
And you thought she thick but she stick like glue
And she thought your rich but your gram ain't you
Look, life is a female dog on mute
That mean there ain't no roof, that mean the sky is the limit
Inspire your vision, brudda enlarge your view
But who in the fuck am I, long road ahead. long way to climb
And you see that I never look side to side
One eye on my step as I eye the prize
And for me money just on the side like fries
I really love this shit, look how I does this shit
I just pray that a couple people love this shit and relate to me like I'm their cuz or shit yeah

[Refrain]
I just put some ammy in my blunt
Running through these marijuana fields
All that other shit is getting flushed
I don’t need nobody in my ear
Foot in on their neck ain't letting up
Leave their body imprint on the field
Give my blood and tears but not a fuck
Playing with fire 4 is getting real



[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Outro]
Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real



[Verse]
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind
A savage over this cabbage
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (No)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs
I'm on my grind, yo, bonafide honcho
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds
Matter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick
Survival's a bitch
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0
God knows I don't put up no facade, no
No fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob
Keep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh
From the other side, punk-ass nigga
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk
Blast pop while I pump gas
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath
My niggas will ride all day like a fun pass
That's some New York shit, I'm from the south, though
Don't never disrespect me out yo mouth, ho
I got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro



[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
"And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country!"
Excuse me

[Verse 1]
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

[Post-Chorus]
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Verse 2]
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'ma pass your classes, I'ma learn your craft
I'ma fuck your daughters, I'ma burn your flag

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

[Post-Chorus]
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Outro]
They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio



[Intro: J. Cole]
Sometimes you rip straight through
(I told you how we was gon’ do it)
And sometimes you just love rappin’ this shit so much you just
(Drama I told you how we was gon’ do it)
You just like “fuck it” let me get that shit again
God, please forgive us

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis, he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga, back on my therapist shit
Moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where the scarecrows at
No brains on them niggas but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam, I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag
Beware of the days when the first go last
And the last go first, damn the past sure hurt
That’s why I hit the Henny in this flask
With my foot pressed heavy on this gas
Life is like a Brillo pad
Sometimes I sit and wish I had the life that Willow had
Said I walk around mad ‘cause I never see my dad
And you wonder why my motherfuckin’ brother’s so bad
And I was in the third grade first time I skipped class
Whoa!
Switch topics, look, my bitch tropic
Stack so thick to fit need six pockets
Smash whole cliques, so sick I get nauseous
Quick as pickpockets, slick like Rick Fox’s hair
Diamond chain, yeah the Roc is here
You lean back like a rocking chair
You niggas not prepared, no preparation
This is dedication
Slit your fuckin’ throat and blame it on my medication
Illuminati meeting, showed up late and met a Mason
Who saw me and assured me that there was no better nation
For, crooks and thieves, looks deceive
They throw The Book at niggas with no books to read
See, there I go, every time I try to stunt
Can’t help but kick the real shit
Man, why I even front?
Maybe ‘cause that’s all you little niggas ever want
But I’mma change the game
See you in a couple months, boy

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Hopefully this here shows y’all somethin’
Dedication
What’s ours, and what’s yours
You see the playing field was never really that even
We just let you play the game but you dropped the ball
Cole World
Born sinner
All the way
Drama
You’re welcome



[Verse]
Mo Money, yeah
Mo Money, Blow Money, Show Money
Party Money, Side Ho Money, Dope Money
New Clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with petroleum and coal money
Probably kill they selves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Pop off, robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga get your money"



[Intro]
You really wanna know who Superman is?
Watch this, pow!
I like him
I think he's pretty cool
He's my idol

[Verse 1]
I can't have no sympathy for fuck niggas
All this shit I've seen done made my blood thicker
Spill promethazine inside a double cup
Double up my cream, now that's a Double Stuff, yeah
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout no commas
Keep the peace like Dalai Lama, big body Hummers
Backin' out the parkin' spot and though the law be on him
He exempt, Shawn Kemp, he keep that .40 on him
Go!

[Chorus]
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)

Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money

[Refrain]
Too many times I swallowed my pride
(Get money)
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I'm poppin' a pill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm

[Verse 2]
Woah, suddenly, I feel like takin' a PJ
(Get money)
Fly to D.R. on a weekday, eatin' ceviche
With like half of a mili' inside of my briefcase
A couple of freaks play
And they don't speak inglés
But the money is somethin' that they could comprende
And I got bread like I'm Green Day
(Get money)
I come around and their heads turn
Used to like bitches with hair permed
Now I like it "natural, actual, factual"
Naps and shit, bougie, still do ratchet shit
Not afraid to pass the clip
Before I make the ratchet spit, blaow!

[Chorus]
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
(Get money)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)

Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money

[Refrain]
Too many times I swallowed my pride
(Get money)
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I'm poppin' a pill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm

[Intro]
Woo
Motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, woo!
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Yeah, a lot of clicks on my page, now they telling me my flow is ace
Lazy rappers in the game, I think I need to motivate
I could leave and take a break come to find I'm owed sick pay
Dug this out of the mud, why in the fuck would I throw it away?
My peers are looking at me with the torch like "Hold this mate"
Many yanks are pissed at the fact that I'm molding lanes
I'm holding traits whilst flowing great
And you wonder why the fanbase is going up at a growing pace
Tryna throw jabs but you gotta slow hit rate
I can't fuck with idiots they show corrosive ways
When their bored they rely on one motive, hate
I'm proud to say throughout the bullshit I stay focused
So tell them other guys, run up on me and catch a bunch of fives
Messing with me or the lyrics you've come to die
You can't overcome my mind
My hunger makes me run on time, I'm brunt cos I'm
Telling these fuckers I don't wanna colab, but, much love guys
Tryna put food on the table for my potential family to eat
Coming up they asking "Who's he?"
When they say my name your crew flee
You can't spit for shit so give up the writing and rip out your loose leaf
Ask your girl for spitting advise that pussy gets beaten loosely
Concrete love my two feet, in other words I'm grounded
Rappers looking real looney, that shit leaves me astounded
I'm corny and weird with some bars, I'd like to say that I'm goofy
So you better start running before I start chucking nuns like I'm Bruce Lee



[Verse 1: Oliver Twixt]
Ain’t got not patience for a flake nigga
We ain’t breaking bread, can’t shake and bake witcha'
I cycle through these metals, heavy my reflector
I leveled up my cake, I’m living triple decker (Ugh)
And if you think for a split one that you bomb, too - you got the wrong bitch
That wet ink dough - eclairs. I garner up so gorgeous
Purp prince in the corvette, diamond and pearls I adorn with
Bottoms up - I top, fags and pop bags on a corn bitch

[Chorus]
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (ugh)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (ugh)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money

[Refrain]
Too many times I swallowed my pride
Get money
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I pocket a bill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm-

[VERSE 2]
You know I'm on -  that all white like Lisa bitch
Everything I own - no rent to buy, no leaser bitch
Better pick the right bone 'fore I jump fence and leash ya bitch
Break up happy homes and give no fucks like Alicia bitch
My pedigree on pedestal, all of my medals impeccable, looking so credible
Look how I  hang, inches - several
Banking payments - call me federal
Higher arrangements - yes, the edible
Look at how you living bitch, look what you settle for
Quick to tell a nigga, pull yourself together
YES! I am incredible
Look at the prince, look how I sit
I be coming up like dick in her tits
Quick to buss a nut so watch where you lip
They steady scrolling up, you never the pic(k)
But of course! I'm endorsed
Campaigning with a big wig stipend
JFK to that Ronald Reg (Ray)
Then its Hartsfield to Virginia Highlands



[Intro: The-Dream]
I see the strangest things
The evil that money brings
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens
And they wanna bury me
Why? Cause I’m anti everything
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens

[Hook: Kanye West & A$AP Rocky]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
The three leading killers of you niggas
Is the shit that’s most appealing to you niggas
Even I fell victim to it, your pride don’t let you do it
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn’t ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what’s the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
Won’t unveil it yet, can’t tell it yet
Defense wins games Bill Belichick
These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check
Yuugh

[Hook]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Shout out my bitches fucking baseball niggas
That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts
Yeah, I see your vision, sick of prison visits
Now the Major League’s where you're fishing
You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can’t judge you ‘cause we ain’t hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love ‘em, make ‘em spare no amount
Make ‘em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you’re worth it
Real bitches worth it

[Hook]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I’ve been watching all you real niggas
I done seen more won't than you will niggas
Take a swing, snatch a chain
Lose your mind, go insane
I’m in the club, you in the club too
I got money, you got money too
You think it’s honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here
It’s no pictures, now you in your feelings
I’m a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos
I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money
I get it done for quarter ki money, for real

[Hook]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey... huh, Cole World
Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, everybody got a bad side, drop, let me see that shit
What you say? "Cole ain't hot," what?
Where you read that shit? You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?
Have you seen my shows? Have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot, would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting that, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me, boy, I'm red hot, aw, nigga, they not
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere, they not (I said)
You'll never play me, nice try, balling in a nice spot
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot
So, you can look, but don't touch
I stay on my toes like the White Sox, cause

[Chorus: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high-roller
Now it's racks on racks, never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?
Young, black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas Eve
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench
Now wonder why I didn't quit the team, but
I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World 'til the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please, I gotta make history

[Chorus: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no, you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Yeah, I got a Hublot, I call it Tebow
I strap that bitch with a gator band
Y'all niggas ball half-time, y'all niggas like the Gator band
Y'all niggas need a time out
Who got these niggas all wound up?
Cocksucker, I'm 730
Y'all know where y'all niggas gonna wind up?
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit yall niggas with a nice shot
Y'all niggas better not call the law
Get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning y'all better not waste my time
When y'all ready I take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors
Put the front on the back, cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'Bach like a boss
So I'm fronting on niggas when I'm backing off
What up, Cole? It's your time, let's these niggas know
Adjust your Rollie on these motherfucking hoes
Whenever you ready, go

[Outro: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
(Ugh, nice watch)



[Verse 1: Tsunami da KingPin]

The son of hip hop, watch out for its one true king

Hip hop has forgot I'm here to reenact the dream

Bring back the scene that only seems legendary

Dead & bury wack shit any means necessary

Yes its scary, that is had to come to this

Couldn't call this simba, I won't ever run from shit

Mufasa Jr. came from the actual jungle

Animamlistic the missing piece to the puzzle

Tell these rap cats they better get used to me

Hip hop gon' go back to what the shit used to be

Used to be niggass spitting truthfully

Over your head, nothing was ever what it seems

Now, y'all ripping the shit apart from it seams

Here to restore pride rock is the new king

Niggas walk down martin luther and they sing

Here to restore pride rock is the new king

Tsunami da kingpin mufasa jr

Growing danger to these wack bastards I'm a tumor

I'm an old school nigga I'm a tudor

Just think of me as a late bloomer

My motivation ain't mike Bloomberg

Just want them charlie sheen bars no loser

Haha Charlie sheen making me smirk now

I just want my place in the circle before it burn down

My m.v. niggas gon' understand that

The top motherfucker is where I'm supposed to stand at

The game represents where I'm supposed to land at

I'm african you hear this track no choice but to brand that

Gimmicks for the cash I can't understand that

Dow jones thinkers but the hearts really nasdaq

Using fissure on the ground underneath

Underground stole that concept from j. Heat

He fam tho, shogunate commission bitch

He throw an alley then know I'm bout to finish it

Bitches cringe with the authority I finish with

I got them car on car bars finished whips

And I already got that bread man ginger shit

On a yacht by swordfish with a ginger bitch

Kicking niggas off the boat palance style trini shit

Stacy adams footprint sucka thats trendy shit

Hash tags then nice after mufasa jr

On bended knee the game needed a proper suitor

Too many niggas fucked this bitch up, karma sutra

They bout fall off sparta style its karma loser

Home is where the heart is at

The beats be vacation homes man a lot of foreign cats

Don't know they way around it taking tourist laps

I be on My cat fight shit ripping all the tracks

With shit you get you b like I'm done dead

And that's without catching what went over your head

Don't fret I said, an explanation looms

The over your head chronicles is coming soon

To clear up any fog or haze in the air

I'm deep all the time not just inhaling the air

Puff Puff pass bars they flaming you hear

Long press on droids then you pressing the share

Tweeting who the eff is this he goes hard

One picture from many, nigga spits a collage

Jean michael basquiot message within the bars

Common sense wrote the book prefer being street smart

I excel in everything I plays my part well

Book smart stringer street wise Barksdale

My bite definitely surpassing my bark yell

I laugh cause the face of danger is where I dwell

The egos of the old guard stays scared

Ill turn you behemoths to an elephant grave yard

Pop off, son, yo what's up nigga

I stay wit a nala to fuk you up nigga

Me and the beat always wrestle we good friends

I just tackled the track, pinned ya again

Me and the beat always wrestle we good friends

I just tackled the track, pinned ya again



[Intro: Wale & J. Cole]
Count me in, Cole
Right here? (Nah, not yet)
Yeah, bounce, bounce
My boy, my boy
My boy, my boy, my boy
Yeah, right here?
Ay, look, uh, yo, okay

[Verse 1: Wale]
Concrete since day one, ain't no time to make up
Ain’t no top on that hoe, like baby with the A-cup
Thank you for your services, invoicing all my haters
Be sure to leave your armor and your woman penetrated
I give her back, I hate her, poof, get out of here
I say congratulations, your old lady renovated
You niggas lazy, my boy, why you hatin', my guy?
You bought her Commes des Garçons, she come and play with your heart
I'm far from a popular artist, one of the hardest, no lesser
And I saw your woman, I caught her low like a Cardigan sweater
Call her whatever you want, I got my revenue up
In Beverly Hills, my ceilings like the Beverly brothers
Since day one, Folarin been the same one
I came up in them go-gos most of them was afraid of
Now kill mo’, say that, now kill mo', say that
But when your wheel is a fortune, you ne'er gotta say jack
Don't be talking too much, these niggas copy too much
These niggas cardio crazy, chasing clout must be tough
Fuck it, I wrote me, a dozen niggas got me fucked up
I raise my hands and raise your family's casualties up
I'm faded, I'm playing
These niggas don't be no gangster, they be paying it, yeah
Extortion ain’t dead, it just moved to the county
Shoot them out the S-class, I guess truancy the problem
I know every who and who and every hoodlum around him
And what you call a piece of mind, I call a picture for a bounty
Hold up, yeah, I’m in my luggage, in my luggage
Hold up, boy, I'm on the runway like I’m Duckie
Hold up, prolific, really be living my lyrics
So tell me who did it this big and who ain't 'bout to slow up?

[Chorus: Wale & J. Cole]
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy, my boy, my boy

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Who gon' bring my crown? And who gon’ try to fuck with me?
Faded off the brown, she can't get enough of me
I don't play around, don't got that type of luxury
Bitch it's going down, and ain't no catching up to me

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, stepped in the building with my vibe on a million
Slide on the beat like my God, I'm so brilliant
All other rappers, put your pride to the side
Try collide with the squad, turn your mob into corn on the cob
You's a fraud, you's a thorn in my side
I'm a knife in your back, I'm that turn of the knob
On the door when the boys from the corner come rob you
And tie you up to something, now stop with all that frontin'
That big money talk should be reserved for those that got it
But when you really got it, you ain't pressed to talk about it
That's why I hear that capping on your raps and highly doubt it
The game too crowded, I'm 'bout to get all the way the fuck up out it
No ifs, ands or buts about it
30 mil' on a deal depending on how the tour was routed
I seen your watch when you first dropped, that shit was clouded
Which means you used to fugazi shit
Fake it 'til you make it-type, I shoot through you crazy with
Hollow tips, no holler backs, just hotter raps
I gotta black to make sure every dirty dollar stacked
Y'all aiming for the stars, bitch, I'm aiming at your Starter cap
Run, nigga, run like a fucking black quarterback (uh)
Stereotypical, but to hear me is pivotal
I will bury you niggas and come and air out your funeral
Have your homies on stretchers right next to Roman numerals
IVs, IVs
It's the reason why nobody try me, try me
Have a nigga screaming, "Lord, why me? Why me? Cole did me grimy
He took it too far, he treat them bullets like they Siamese"
Back to back, I clap like that's a wrap
But no video shoots, just hoodies and boots
Puttin' your troops in pine boxes
I blew a million on white tees and Calvin Klein boxers
This nigga silly

[Chorus: J. Cole]
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
My boy, my boy, my boy, say what!

[Bridge: Wale &  J. Cole]
Who gon' bring the crown? And who gon' try to fuck with me?
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
Faded off the brown, she can't get enough of me
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
I don't play around, don't got that type of luxury
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
Bitch it's going down, nobody catching up to me
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy, my boy

[Outro: J. Cole]
Who gon' bring my crown? And who gon' try to fuck with me?
Faded off the brown, she can't get enough of me
I don't play around, don't got that type of luxury
Bitch it's going down, and ain't no catching up to me
Who gon' bring my crown? And who gon' try to fuck with me?
Faded off the brown, and she can't get enough of me
I don't play around, don't got that type of luxury
Bitch it's going down, it ain't no catching up to me
Who gon' bring my crown? And who gon' try to fuck with me?
Faded off the brown, and she can't get enough of me
I don't play around, don't got that type of luxury
Bitch it's going down, it ain't no catching up to me



[Intro: Bas]
My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail

[Verse 1: Bas]
My nigga just made bail
I just came up, On some grey 12's
Great health, cheers to that
Do this shit for Queens got my ears to that
They hate us but, not more they hate theyselves
I guess that they gotta motivate theyselves
We can never correlate, you will never see my plane
Right in front of you but your vision is so plain
I see it more vivid, seen it all, did it
Round these fake fucks still keep it authentic, granted
Give or take fucks, how your measures rate us
Damnit, you'll never understand it
And even though I'm so lit
I've seen the cards handed and I replayed mine
Hell yeah I'm on tilt
But I'm never off handed, gotta keep good time

[Pre-Hook: J. Cole]
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you

My nigga just made bail (won't you)
My nigga just made bail (won't you)
My nigga just made bail

[Verse 2: Bas]
Listen when you get a blessin you don't ask why
You just pass forward, and fast forward
All my niggas from the hood got a passport
And them girls already know we ain't ask for it
Said she from the hood but her ass foreign
Drive a Malibu but her gas foreign
Her aspirations I can't relate with
But I'm like a ghost cause my ass tourin'
Burn holes in all my clothes
But I got merch and this cash for it
Glass floors and no ceilings
How I wish we could both feel it
For all the ones gone cause I miss your breathing
Any y'all saw came any y'all part
Gotta race cars
Penny my thoughts, nah this shit premium
Bas

[Pre-Hook: J. Cole]
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you

Tell the good Lord, we gon raise hell

Take the top off and get ill get ill get

Tell the fuckin mayor he got hate mail
Less shakedowns and more Shakespeare
Please, all these niggas don't care
Prepare for the new shit, that Cole is the truth shit
Nigga this is Lu shit, nigga this is Bas shit
Meaning this some true shit, telling you shit
Bout the crew, how we do shit, who sick?
And, tell my niggas in the two-six in the coupe
I'mma kick back smoke a pool stick
This for my new chick tryin get fit say she too thick
Ain't no such thing as too thick, what you wanna be a toothpick?
What you wanna get your cooch licked?
Well I'm tryna get my flute played
If we the new slaves
I am Frederick Douglass of rhetoric ahead the the others
You motherfuckas better get free
This for that insecure girl, your name I won't mention
On Instagram straight flickin'
Bitch you a nipple slip away from strippin'
Might as well, get your clientele up, you a pioneer
Them girls fuck for free, I'm never buying there
Save that shit for the D.R
I rock crowns and these niggas rock tiaras or tiaras
'Cause I'm Pete Carroll, left college and I fucked the pros up
Guess it ain't luck when the luck just shows up
Like every verse on the spot, shit is never rehearsed
You heard it first, Bas

[Interlude: Ibrahim]
My I swear to God, Cole world
We doin' it out here, in the UK fool!
Y'all ain't ready, I got Bas the Genius over there
I got DJ Dummy downstairs
I swear to God we doing this shit
We gon' take on the world

[Outro: J. Cole]
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you, won't you



[Verso 1]
Somos nós contra eles, eu e os da minha laia
Defendes o que te move, ou então morres na praia
Muitas tentativas, muitos são cobaias
À guerra os manos tremem como faz o cú da Blaya
Mas assumo a responsa, I'mma take it higher
Pirotecnia, Jimmy boy spit fire
So high, so fly
Eu vejo os manos a voar só com dois bafos de kaya
Vêem tudo turvo, na cabeça é muito fumo
Atenções em mim os manos ficam com ciúme
Tão a fazer de tudo para (eu) não chegar ao cume
Como o meu mano dizzy, vou manter a cena rude
Querem gravar com o miúdo, que é para apanhar boleia
Camisola 10, tu sabes bem quem é o player
Tão a olhar de lado, a fazer cara feia
A minha cena é love, cada um colhe o que semeia
Há muita cena funny, tanta cabeça oca
Manos tão como a fanny, só querem vida louca
Boy eu estou atrás do money, mesmo que seja pouco
Fala menos homie, porque o peixe morre pela boca
Pelo massivo não papo, insultos...
E se é para levar com as balas caga nisso
Para isso tou cá, mas eu aviso dou cabo
Fala da minha familia eu entro em modo Jon Bones, easy knockout
É que isto é rap boy
Ou tu não vês que elas querem vir p'ra chillar com o sexy
Natty Dread boy!

[Refrão]
Natty Dread boy
Natty Dread boy
Natty Dread boy

[Verso 2]
Há muito comprador, sempre a mostrar que tem
São tantos impostores, que eu não sei quem é quem
Mas sei a quem eu devo, a Deus e mais ninguém
O azar de quem me teve, é a sorte de quem me tem
Mas represento o que essa gente reprova
Loucos p'ra me ver na lama e p'ra me ver na cova
Vivem na penumbra, eu tou a seguir a luz
Põe-me a coroa de espinhos e prega-me numa cruz
Que eu tenho perdão de sobra
Reserva-me um lugar no panteão, vou imortalizar a minha obra
Tu queres protagonismo, boy ele é todo teu
Apedreja-me e insulta-me como faz o fariseu
Isto está desnivelado, por isso digo-te eu
Nunca hás-de ver um gigante em lutas de pigmeu
Tens amor à camisola tu
Dá-me uma bola de trapos
Eu jogo descalço e de tronco nú
Os ignorantes dão p'ra sábios
Sou arte urbana, mona lisa com king size nos lábios
É que isto é rap boy
E muitos estão no anonimato porque a culpa é do crazy Natty Dread boy!

[Refrão]
Natty Dread boy

[Verse]
There's gold at stake for Golden State
How much weight can King's shoulders take
When the odds ain't great some fold and break
While greats let the dreams of a ring motivate
Boys become men when postseasons begin
These lights shine brighter baby, sink or you swim
To those who got here by the skin of they teeth
The formula's the same now: win and repeat
Never sleep on a man that's expected to lose
With a chip on his shoulder and something to prove
The bottom's full of Wolves and they thirsty for blood
The mission is to catch somebody slipping above
"But numbers don't lie," I've heard 'em say it at times
"Cream rises to the top," is a favorite of mine
And the cream of this crop you'll admit is impressive
But to quote the boy Hov, "Gotta finish your breakfast"
And watch for the quiet ones, they bringin' the storm
Even with a man down, "The show must go on"
No time for crying, better pick up the slack
Cause ain't no guarantee that you gon' ever be back



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, what's good baby?
Shit, I ain't seen you in a minute
Now you wanna' hit me

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Shawty I'mma tell you something you don't wanna' hear(yeah), hear(yeah), hear(yeah)
You threw a nigga to the curb
I fronted like I didn't even care(yeah), care(yeah), care(yeah)
But deep down
I needed your umbrella couldn't make it through the rain(yep), rain(yep), rain(Yep)
So I been fuckin' everthing in this town trying to run from the pain, pain, pain
And now suddenly you say you wanna chat, but what is that?
You feel like Kobe, like I'm Shaq
Look how you need a nigga back
Ironic
You burned my heart up like some chronic
Now you say you want it once mo' but what fo'
You did me dirty like some must
So shit why would I?
Plus my niggas know you played me so how could I?
Nah fuck trynna look cool I ain't nobody's fool
I sang the blues for like four months
Now you wanna show up?
You saying that you feenin' for me screaming to me
Boy I need you bad

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
Boy I need you bad as my heart beat (Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breathe (Baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain (Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm about to go insane (Baby I need you bad)
I need you(I)
I need you(I, I)
What I gotta do? (Baby I want you bad)
I need you(I)
I need you(I, I)
Do it all for you (Baby I need you) Hey

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
Baby there's nothing I wouldn't do
To get back what we had when love was true
No lie, I'd give up all I got
Just so I can get back in my spot

[Hook Repeated]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Oh, you want me bad how the cops want black folks
Bad like Dirty Diana
Bad like black toast
Bad like sour lactose like that crack smoke
You feenin'
Left a nigga out to dry like some semen
Baby deaded me
Was far from a dog I had no pedigree, Unh
No leash needed
You ripped up your lease speeded out the crib
Now I'm supposed to just forget and forgive
Pardon, you say I'm your heart
But baby how bad do you want it, want it?

[Outro w/repeated Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
When you want him so bad and you gotta get him back say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
Cuz' it won't get no better til' you are together say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If you believe in ya love and you can't give him up say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If there's nothing you won't do to get back with your boo say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)



[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side



[Verse]
Too many best-rappers, not enough best-rhymes, though
Guess I'm delusional, used to doing it all the time, so
Maybe I'm just jaded, out of touch and unrelated
Unable to connect greatness based on the person who makes it
Or maybe I just hate it
And that would make me hater
Maybe it is great but that don't mean it's greater
Having your profile raised doesn't make you a raiser
Being ambiguous with assertions, isn't making you safer
What you mean, though?
Line us up, paddling us on the back
Like we steamboat, you president of the frat
You goin' sling toast, like you Ringo
And you think Doc Holliday's
Just goin' tolerate and too sick to let that thing go
It's just a matter of returns
Ashes to ashes, scattered them from the urns
To start a fire shaky to gather them from the burned
And reassemble these ashes, the blackness is something firm
Then moving blackness backwards in the bread of some other shit
Any deep we spreadin' wheat seeds from a bucket shit
McDonald had a farm and he lovin' it
Rolls Royce of the scented voice against the arms of the government
Artists gettin' robbed for their publishing
By dirty Jewish execs that think his alms from the covenant
I'll retire when I'm tired, that's a Firestone death
Easy to say when nobody's there, like a microphone check
They wanna hear what I'm gon' say before the microphone check
Make me sign an NDA before the microphone test
'Less you face that type of faith, institutional opposition
Then with all due respect, you are not my competition
Nah



[Hook]
Is the whole world gunnin for me
Or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothin but time
One day youre gonna set me free
But first you got to let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look mama I’m flying

To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
I’ll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, no, I’ll never ever land

[Verse 1 - J Cole]
Check my fortune cookie, it say Cole World
Could that mean it's meant to be?
So much drive a nigga could've been a chauffeur
This life is fuckin with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they're a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemy
My good girl say they want to know the inner me
My bad girl saying "fuck all that, enter me"
Double shots, Hennessy, bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut somethin, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them motherfuckas sign off
I got them on my dick, they’ll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off
I don’t know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
I’m sortin through this
Organized confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is soundin like a movie you can watch forever
I got to make it to the top, its either now or never
These other niggas can't adapt because they're not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter?
Cole World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And so sick they can’t fix this with modern medicine
We at your door and she's got to let us in
It’s what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now I’m what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as I’m speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I got to catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like I’m the underdog, I’m on already
Got a few niggas we about to prove wrong, yall already already



[Intro]
Yeah, what's up girl?

[Verse 1]
Angel eyes, long hair, I see you cryin', what's wrong there
"He did what? He fucked who?", we know the story, what's new?
See I could probably rush you, tell you that he shoulda loved you
Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score, you got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode; why we cheat, I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
Like heterosexuals, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
I never told, I never told

[Interlude 1]
Father: Hey you wanna be a man?
Son: Yeah I wanna be a man
Father: A man don't run and tell his mama everything he see
Son: I ain't gon' tell
Father: Alright, alright then man, be a man then
Son: Alright

[Verse 2]
Ok, that's what it is, I see the game, the hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange, fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The OG's that beat the game, forever young, Peter Pan
35? Still playing; Child support? Still paying
Juggling, bill paying, been running round, field daying
Wine and dine, meal paying, with hopes that she'll lay in
The bed and, get wet then, give head then, you bet man
The same girl who said we just met man, game colder than the fucking dead man
One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids or Reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressed and don't wanna be your ex-man
Cause Cupid aims and throw the darts, there go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?

[Interlude 2]
Wife: You know what? I need to talk to you
Husband: About what?
Wife: I don’t think this is, working out for us
Husband: Why?
Wife: I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that’s all
Husband: What the fuck?!”
Wife: You know?



[Verse 1: Kelby]
A little less hate
Let’s make a lot more love
Shape a history that we can be proud of
Get out from under the covers
No shame in loving your brothers
But we’re having trouble giving 'cus we can’t love us
So I just focus on healing
Tried to listen to myself got caught up in the feelings
I wanna put my whole self out
But since we fell out
I got hurt, and now it’s too revealing
I want to build back trust
Gotta start with honesty but real’s too much
These scars ain’t tough
And though it hurts me soul
There’s a paradoxical high in being exposed
Fear keeps me closed
Wanna bite the bullet put my soul on the track
Like nothing’s changed
Heart on my sleeve
Like I’m not ashamed
But I’m not there yet
Know that I’ve got to be
I’m working on the path so that I can be free
Working hard, sweating I don’t have a degree
Wonder how much longer I’ll be stuck in the academy
But that’s no complaint, it's great, I give thanks, and say grace
Now imma be the change I want to see!



[Intro: J. Cole]
This for all my niggas in the city
But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though, ya know?
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Getting money regiment with my get money regime
Nah mean? yeah

[Verse 1 : J Cole]
New York times, come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money, it seems, by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch, I blow a kiss at her daughter
In the city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibly stressin', a mess, he smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that, all I do is pray for that
This the city of God told me "Go and make it" at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 2 : J Cole]
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick, that's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparations for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We dont make it primetime till we dyin'

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 3: Bas]
How I go from selling reefer and plates
Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly integrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart
Nigga, bitch nigga, take a pause
Hundred shots through the dark you can never hit my heart

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York



[Intro]
These niggas know
Huh

[Verse 1]
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed; no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 2]
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that,but I never fly that
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacker that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggas know
If not, these niggas know

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I must confess, I cut the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know



[Intro: Jeremih]
I won't let it out until you let me know if you love it
Aye, baby, I'mma take it low

[Verse 1: Bas]
I'm on my night job, my niggas riding my city understand us
See a hundred bandits, each put a hundred bands up
They can't call us bandits no more
Same hood, same corner store
But them same old hoes ain't wearing panties no more
I'm on my night job, slim waist with them fat thighs
Never been baptized, but she soak me all in her holy water
I'm one of five, she the only daughter—she ain't used to sharing
I ain't used to caring, let's play truth or dare
'Cause lately my lifestyle's like dynamite
I'mma go lights out like Dyna might
Smoke one, that I might—I'm on my night job
Always knew how to play these cards of mine
Fuck rap, we seen harder times
Jump back like Vinny Carter prime
I'm on my—

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I won't let it out until you let me know if you love it
Aye, baby, I'ma take it low

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm on my night job, y'all niggas jivin', I'm back up in position
Earnhardt, I'mma catch some nigga slippin'
Burn hard on a track and get to whippin'
I'm on my night job, why is it always blacks that get detention?
For my nigga with the pass to get the flip in
Boy, that trap is a accurate description
I'm on my night job, finally got Bassy off the corner
'010 niggas thought he was a goner
He ducked shots, now it's "Bas we got a phoner"
I'm on my night job, flew the posse out to Rome and
Won't tell you 'bout no Bo$$-Key-Yacht$, don't want 'em
Nigga, word to Selassie I, I'm zonin'
I'm on my night job

[Verse 3: Bas]
Got old niggas tryna bite cause they can't capture
The feeling from days 'fore the game passed 'em
Niggas out here lookin' like a bunch of Dame Dashes
Nicorette, that's patchwork
That ain't better than your last work
Cigarette, let the ash burn
Omen said don't worry 'bout the last word
I'ma hit the gas, swerve on 'em—Skrr!

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Too high to riot, that's my best excuse for being lazy
Being an artist, that's the best excuse for being crazy
I've been so infatuated, went to Clark and graduated
Now she on my face time and, my nigga, she just masturbated

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Fuck a album release party, I'm out in the streets, shawty
How many rappers I killed—counted at least forty
Nah, I ain't God, but shawty down on her knees for me
I'm horny like that Coltrane album
A Love Supreme, that's Cole fave album
Lately, I've been dancing like a Soul Train album
Lately, silly making songs talkin' 'bout how they hate me
They've been loving me this whole time
My only adversary was my own mind
Killed my ego now I'm snappin' like it's '09
With a gold mine of inspiration for y'all
Fuck your co-sign, that nigga can't fuck with Cole neither
Don't ask for a feature, we bring a whole liter of ether
To eat ya, we got heat for niggas, keep reachin'
If these bullets was heat seeking
They wouldn't even reach you niggas
I'm on my...



Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix breed, fame, and pain, this it's heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just painting my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told, I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Images, everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, then what they believe
Money short, so this jewelry is like a weave
Here to deceive and hear niggas say, "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
The police wanna stop you, frisk you, wonder, "What he do?"
If a hater snatch a chain I bet it still won't free you
Cause I'll be right back grindin' 'til I cop another
I sit and think 'bout all the shit I could've copped my mother
My partner say, "That's just the game, my nigga"
So I hear my jeweler say, "Here goes your chain, my nigga"



[Intro: J. Cole]
Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh



Verse 1:

I don't write my future, I read it
Crystal ball leading me through the fire
Actions inspired, no effort required
I always get what I'm needing
Never what I'm wanting
I only block what's in front of me when I start fronting
So I don't go running
I don't go hunting
I just stand my ground
I see the deer in the distance
And trust that it's coming
Cause what I seek is seeking me
Eventually is an illusion
There's no need to be pursuing
I read it like a student

I been studying these laws
I am both effect and cause
I'm the one who makes the calls
Everything I want
It's mine, it's mine

Hook:

It's yours, it's yours, it's yours
It's mine, it's mine

Everything I want
It's yours it's yours it's mine

Verse 2:

I’m breaking all the rules
I won't stay stagnant I'm on the move
I stay in tune, yeah
I'm bringing the flows the season monsoon, yeah
Got nothing to prove yeah, yeah
Man, i just got groove, yeah yeah
I got that juice, yeah yeah yeah


They called me Queen Nardean
I never once did ask them
They just felt the energy when I walked past them
It's like magic, those Hogwarts tests I passed them
Using words as spells, so like nets we cast them
I think we could make a new mould
Use these lyrics as plaster


There's no start no end, nothing to mend
Each crack you think you have is there to let you breathe
My darling you
Are already there
Outlined by god
The lines they are sharp
Like edges of glass
I'm catching the shards
So I can be a reflection of yours
I'm blessed with a cause
Not flexing for more
Or settling scores
I'm a flicker and a filament
Like sunshine it's warm when you feeling it
Your prayers I'm hearing em
Through dimensions, I'm steering them
Cheering them forwards and onwards and present electric
We're charged up magnetic
So read what is written
Decode the records with intuition
The path it does know you
The omens will show you
Everything's abundant, nothing is redundant
Everything you want
It's yours


Hook:

It's yours it's yours it's yours
It's mine it's mine

Everything I want
It's yours it's yours it's mine

I don't really mind
Everything I want
Yours it's yours it's yours
It's mine it's mine ❤️



[Hook]

What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain

[Verse]

The city fucked up, even thug niggas getting robbed
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station
Filling out them applications, but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Paychecks spent on necklaces
Downpayments on them lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft, with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimists
Cause ain't no holding me back
The lil' nigga had big dreams, to do big things
But in this game, everything ain't what this shit seems
Try hard, to climb up to the flag-pole
Just to find out that your heroes is some assholes

[Hook] (x2)

But ain't no holding me back
I'mma get mine, believe that
Aye what's sunshine with no rain
Aye what's joy without the pain
Man I'm still gon' do my thang

[Verse]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved



[Intro]
Shout out to the ones who know
Hold tight like I'm never letting go
I saved them
I saved them
I saved them
I saved them

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I would be a role model
Whole lotta sour as the pith hire my own product
So cover what I've covered and money blown in drone mode
Power I was in love with it when I discovered it
Never knew I was barking at
Sipping on a roach, barely can breathe, I choked
No seeds, no stems, between the leaves of the trees as I float out my glass house knowing it's broke like how did they know

[Hook 1]
Shout out to the ones who kept on
Shout out to the ones at home
Shout out to the ones who slept on
Thinking God can't save they soul
He'll save them
Yeah, He'll save them
He'll save them
He saved me

[Verse 2]
I mean who woulda known
Picture me as a role model
With a whole lotta baggage in my back pack
Weed in the knapsack
Hennessey sipped like a cup of tea
What if life seemed like a dream, not Martin Luther King's, a fact that
Life lived clean for Jesus seems hard to get
Far fetched to a non-believer but I've seen and apparently I've fallen next to His feet in the sand
Like a lamb, He carries me
Committed to forgiveness to the dead that had buried me
In a coffin they carry me like a bride, I'm marrying at the side of the King
I arrived meet Him at the sky
Fly and say bye to the world I tarried in
He was sent for me
I could never be
Anything to Him
He chose to be a friend of me
Been His enemy
Stressing over petty beef used poison as a remedy
Sentence too long, same song different melody
Product of what the world was selling me
What I better be made new in the image of the heavenly
Seconds can measure what I treasure in this life but I inherit in what the screaming mean
And what I could never be, never dreamed to believe but I seek and move, sprout trees
The moment I open up your palm, the doubt leaves
The presence of the Holy Spirit just surrounds me
It drowns me
The waters that I walk on, astounding and they say

[Hook 2]
Shout out to the ones who slept on
Shout out to the ones at home
Soon as they wake, we crept on
Hold tight I could never let them go
I saved them
I saved them
I can't save them
No God, only You
Only You can save 'em
Shout out to the ones who kept on
Shout out to the ones at home
Shout out to the ones who slept on
Thinking God can't save my soul
He'll save them
He'll save them
He'll save them
He could save them
He could save them
He could save them
He could save them
Yeah, yeah
He could save them yeah, yeah
Who woulda thought I would be a role model
Who woulda thought I would be a role model
Only following after You Lord

[Interlude]
Shame on you
If you fool me we can't get fooled again

[Outro]
The world ain't gonna fool me no more
Xist

[Intro - The Notorious B.I.G. & *2Pac*]
*Part 2*
This album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothing
*Gotta hit you with a hot track*
Down to the east coast to the
*Westside!*
I'm blowing up like you thought I would, like you thought I would

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed on Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight, 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled, listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at ridin'
Passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed, for all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Come on

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Bridge: Janet Jackson]
Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

[Interlude: Janet Jackson (J. Cole)]
Cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (yeah that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 3: J. Cole (Janet Jackson)]
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (J. Cole) Simultaneous]
Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)

And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

[Bridge]
I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever
Something that's old as forever
Love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter

[Outro]
Love, love, love, love



[Verse 1: Fashawn]
The ghetto is pitch black and we all wanna shine
So a third of us rhyme
The other half about math, flipping birds, we intertwine
There is no words to describe my habitat except hostile
40oz. brews and trips to the hospital or Wasco
Get locked in solitude surrounded by darkness hoping some light shine through
Cause we used to DVD boosting, crack rock producing, business suits claim we're useless
And won't give us jobs, and wonder why their ass get robbed
Wonder why my young brother stuck on reefer
Because the state refuse to pay good teachers
While the rich kids watch from the bleachers
I ask Jesus let some light creep in

[Hook: J. Cole]
May I kick a little something for the G's and cold hearted niggas that's freezin'
Everythang happens for a reason
But why a nigga stuck shit, this ain't nothing for the radio, nah this ain't nothing for the radio
Nah, this right here what you've been waiting for, hey this right here what you've been waiting for

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Why is it me that this dark cloud follows?
I probably drown in this Belvedere bottle
Ugh I get my hymns from him it's a revival
The limits keep my hands spinning like a gyro
I need a chiro-prac, cause I feel like I'm alone in this world
Who got my back?
They tell me find god like I don't know where he at
And if he lost why we following him
Just acknowledge the fact that a father exists
And the devil's alive, I'm just caught in the mix
Before he shines his light on me I was out on the strip
Holding it down till I discovered my gift (got talent bro, I'm telling you)
It felt more like a curse, in my hoodie, I still made it to church
Just in time they hear the pastor complain like sunshine after the rain, help us out

[Hook: J. Cole]



[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me
Soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama
On my mama, we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
They say we won't last
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad
Good chick, alone, mad as fuck, she done had enough
I be, out here tryna raise my status up
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, who ain't about nothin'
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart, long before I broke your heart
If I lost your respect, I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been a while
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now
And times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same ?
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from friends to somethin' much more
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more
Second chances, we gave enough
'Til finally we gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)



[Verse 1]
Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain’t no mystery why there picking me for
I’ve been hot since ’97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I’m skinny, didn’t eat so I’m hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it’s funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn’t get on
One time for my city bitch I’m putting it on
Like a condom when I’m with your girl, ballin’ like it’s intramural
Back in middle school, hoopin’ to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminisce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn’t nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn’t make it past flirting
Now I’m taking baths with their naked ass jerkin
"Make It Last Forever" playing in the background
You can take it as whatever I was laying that down
She gon' hate my ass forever, I ain't bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them text'es, spillin all your stresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast’es
I never disrespected, I’m clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don’t wanna fuck him, now they wanna f-ckin’ like him
And hope he fucking wife em

[Break]
Yeah, nuttin’ like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin’ jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can’t impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh apparently, some of y’all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don’t care to see
Don’t make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your new favorite rapper embarrassed, see
I’m the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don’t wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I’m dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs. Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y’all gotta shed me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me, nigga
Yeah, yeh



Straight out the dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don’t make it back
Hey, hey, ugh
Gossip from those that barely knew my name
I guess they figured I changed with this new found fame
Or this new damn chain
I’m in a new damn lane
Now my money taller than Shaq stacked with two Yao Mings
But never mind them haters girl
I won’t bring you round lames
Rather bring you round Hov
Let you meet Bron James
Sit you up in VIP and let you sip Champagne
Watch them jealous hoes peeking
Mad they just can’t hang
If that's the ish you into
This life is funny cause despite the money
Nothing stops the rain from pouring
Life ain't always bright and sunny
Nothing stops the pain, you just ignore it
And keep fighting honey
So much drive, ain't no cop alive can take my license from me
I’m swerving on em, fast lane
Fayettenam lifestyle, foot down on the gas man
Passport tight now, I’m leaving on the last plane
Balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name
I said balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name

Okay, East Atlanta playboy
Don't got much to say, boy
Cradle to the grave, and it's been like that since a slave, boy
It ain't shit to pull up, pick the fucking tool up
Screaming hallelujah, pushing daisies and some tulips
(Hi guys, hi, hi, hi)
Itty bitty bitch, niggas in the city with it, pull up with a stick
Thirty with the dick
Seen you in a minute, nigga, put you in cement
Anybody get a nigga, anybody get
Shot to the top, nigga poppin' this shit
Got the drop in your crib, in the spot where you live
If you talking that shit, nigga, stop it
I'm a god, I'm a king, I'm a giant
Nigga not trying, .40 my side
Eastside guy, but I been worldwide
D.I.Y, T.I.Y, I'ma try, I'ma die for what I believe in
We like to feast and I try to eat, cannibal meat
I am not an animal, a beast
Riding with the hammer on the seat (Oh)
Shotgun, shotgun, hand on my heat
Bad man, bad man, land of my freedom
Nigga get life, let the white folks be
Online beef, not my motif
.45 me, ta-ta, go sleep
Don't mind little old me, lil' OG
J.I.D, I came in on the boat, see
May I be the cold nigga with the most heat
Niggas know bro, you don't know me

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Legend out the 2-6 (Whoa)

Crazy like a movie by that nigga Stanley Kubrick (Whoa)
Perfect time to pop up (Whoa)
Wet you like the hot tub (Whoa)
Clean up Aisle 7, damn somebody gettin' mopped up (Whoa)
Pull up on the block, eeny, meeny, miny, moe
You and every nigga that you know is getting popped
Fuckin' with a nigga, ass sitting in the box
Tryna sneak diss, then I'm pickin' up the Glock
I squeeze this, they be pickin' up the top
Styles, Sheek, Kiss, yeah, I'm pickin' all the locks
Pickin' on a nigga way bigger, then I got
Bigger than the nigga that was Kindergarten Cop
Terminator shit, I'm a robot
With the chrome .45 that most don't got
One false move, get your moto shot
Turn a nigga whip to a photo op
Click, click, click, and the flows don't stop
'Til I got more cream than Cold Stone got
Like a boatload, nigga I'ma float on top
'Til the grass don't grow and the wind don't blow
And the po-po don't kill niggas no more
I bought a thirty round extendo
If a nigga wanna duck, then I'm playing Duck Hunt
In real life, not on Nintendo
Looking out the window like Malcolm X with the rifle
Climb the steps up the Eiffel
Barely broke a bead of sweat, whoa
Many hope to be the best, oh
Cannot fuck with me just yet, though
J.I.D the closest thing to me
C'est la vie, my vocal range putting
Blood stains on Notre Dame hoodies
Hello fiends, I brought novocaine plus dopamine
You can load your veins with the product I slang
Niggas gon' honor my name, boy, I'm a god in this game
Y'all niggas homonyms, sounding the same
Not in my lane so I can't complain
Me and Ben Frank got a damn good thing goin' on
Way more than a random fling
Cole and J.I.D with a tandem, niggas can't stand 'em
Got a new anthem, look at my whip
Slit on my wrist, suicide, suicide doors on my Phantom

[Chorus: J.I.D & J. Cole ]
Get off my dick, get off my dick
.40 my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, roll up my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this ship
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit

[Part I: "Oh Wow"]

[Intro: Zoink Gang]
Oh wow
You want the next part, kablaow
Yeah, kablaow, yeah
Hold up, oh wow, shit
That's the part
Shit, I’m proud
The track
Got a whole lot of cash
Kablaow
I put a hole in your...

[Chorus: Zoink Gang]
Oh wow (Oh wow, oh wow)
She got a big old ass, I'm proud (But)
I got a whole lot of cash, kablaow
I put a hole in your ass (And then), I'm out
Like a motherfuckin’ lamp

[Verse: J. Cole]
Smoke in my nappy dreads, how you scared to die, nigga?
Don't believe that lie, I think that everybody happy dead
Hell is a fabricated figment of imagination
I done seen worse for real right there off Yadkin and behind gas station
Cambridge Homes, 'partments where the girls get damaged young
From overexposure to the vultures
And prey on them like pastors is supposed to
If they wasn't so concerned about the tags that's on they clothes, but
Guess that's how it goes, fuck it, what do I know?
Ain't been in service since Jim Jones had somethin' with Hov
I document my life with rap beefs, love songs, favorite albums
In years that my niggas got blood on they sneakers from bodies they might’ve caught
I don’t judge no one, I'm just knowin’
At night, when it get quiet, that shit could fuck with 'em
And if it don't right now, it's gon’ catch up to 'em
Guilt heavy as a cloud in a thunderstorm, huh
My niggas blowing loud like an elephant
It's helpin' 'em to cope, I don't do nothin' if it don't
Make somethin', make a dollar
Make me wonder, make me prouder
Make me karma, make me better
I ain't no killer, don't make me have to, nigga
You want my spot, well maybe after, nigga
So active on the radio, I'm radioactive, nigga
That's a bar, I had to give it to 'em
Never slouching, not even on couches in the living room
And I feel like the world is ending soon
Is there any good or bad? Well that's depending on you
And if you wake up in time
I know it's better to be sleep, that's why we hate the alarm
I feel you

[Chorus: Zoink Gang]
Oh wow (Oh wow, oh wow)
She got a big old ass (She got a big old butt), I'm proud (What?)
I got a whole lot of cash (Racks, racks), kablaow
I put a hole in your ass (And then), I'm out
Like a motherfuckin' lamp

[Part II: "Swerve"]

[Intro: KEY!]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Bizness Boi
Yeah, uh
Oh yeah

[Chorus: KEY!]
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh

[Verse: Maxo Kream]
The way I'm robbin', niggas say I'm gonna die
I bought a baby Draco carbon, that's a motherfuckin' lie
Stephen Curry on my hip, Klay Thompson, let it fly
Southwest Murder Block Crips, we don't die, we multiply (Crip)
Maxo talk a lot of shit but is he really 'bout that life? (Say what?)
Is a pig's pussy pork and can a caterpillar fly? (That's right)
Go Go Gadget, toting ratchets, beam attachment on the side
I keep a savage that'll blast it, my crash dummies down to ride
These niggas janky than a bitch, I do my shit up on my lonely
So I can't trust you on a lick if you not Nina, Mac, or Tommy
Traphouse serving like hibachi, Draco, chopstick, baby AK
Different flavors like Tekashi, twelve gauge shotty like I'm Tr3yway
Maxo Kobe, holy moly, servin' smokey like I'm Day-Day
Runnin' out of dog food like I fed Chico
Put a brick on your head and get you dropped like Deebo
I'm slangin' bricks like Craig, I'm tryna drop these bows

[Chorus: KEY!]
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh

[Outro: JID]
Look
Alright, I fucked up my whip 'cause I'm high and I swerve
Sorry that I scared you, I didn't do that on purpose
My life been fucked up so I got problems with my nerves
My hands get sweaty, hold up, blam, steady



[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)



[Intro - J. Cole]
Watch out, you have to you have to watch out for the legends

Hell yeah man you know what I’m saying when I came in rap all I wanted was like a number one album, platinum single or something. That’s it that’s all I ever wanted

You know nobody has to make room you gotta earn everything you get. You know what I mean? Nobodies just gonna stamp you a legend if you’re not doing anything that’s legendary

[Verse - Plowman]
See I always felt a little different than my peers
Cause they counting down the minutes
I be counting down the years
See their dreams far that’s when they start to veer
I just stay up working hard cause my dreams right here
I’m feeling like a Guinness they just feeling like a light beer
I’m feeling far ahead got some buzz like I’m light year
But I ain’t trying to get drunk
I like this level right here
And if I like this town, I might just spend the night here
Living for the future
Living for the past
Living for the present present won’t last
Foot on the break or
Foot on the gas
Chasing first place or
Getting lapped
Living for the future are

[Pre-Chorus - Plowman]
You living for the past
Are you living for the present?
The present won’t last
Is your foot on the break?
Or is your foot on the gas?
Are you chasing first place or
You sitting getting lapped?

[Hook - Plowman]
Here I am rapping like it’s just you and me
One life for yourself and one life for your dreams
Here I am rapping like it’s just you and me
One life for yourself and one life for your dreams

[Verse - Momento]
Hey
Back in the day they say you gotta live one kind of life
Go to school get a job slave away until you die
But I told them that’s not happening
Do what everybody do you end up being average
Plowman (what’s up?) man I feel what you’re saying
I’m not like my peers I had a better perspective
The fuckers couldn’t see it  I was never accepted
The life I’m living now  bitch you better respect it
One life for the future one life for the past
Nothing for the present ‘cause the present doesn’t last
You cruisin’ with the brakes? I’m slammin’ on the gas
You living for right now bitch you end up getting lapped
Now y’all saying you hating your jobs
No time for your dreams? Won’t even take a day off
I speak for myself I decided who I’m going to be
Day by day week by week  I feel it getting close to me

[Hook - Plowman]
Here I am rapping like it’s just you and me
One life for yourself and one life for your dreams
Here I am rapping like it’s just you and me
One life for yourself and one life for your dreams

Dreams



[Verse 1: Elle Varner]
Thought you were just another Romeo
The shoe you pass by in the store window
But soon as I got home I wish I bought you instead
I got it bad, I'll take the black, take the navy and red
No other man has ever, ever had quite this effect
I sleep alone cause there's no room in my bed
For any other lover, you're no good to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage
And I don’t wanna stop it

[Hook]
Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

[Verse 2: Elle Varner]
I came before this digital ocean
Where folks only move in digital motion
But you’re so classic, I want you more than my Adidas
All the bees are getting at you cause your honey is sweetest
I need you, you're no good to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage and I don’t want to stop it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Give me this good, what can I say?
I just don’t know, my love ain't no trip for the weekend
Here to stay for all of the seasons
You’re the weakness that I can’t control

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Baby you all I need to get by
You’re fly, so you’re all I need to get high
You got it? Uh, so put ya number in this camera phone
And we can live like the camera’s on, no script though
These boys claiming they ball, got no grip though
My flow switch mode, it’s so schizo
So I’m the one that your girl blow a kiss for
You've gotta love me, Cole World, no Snuggie
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You’re hoping I’m the one
But I already knew though
It ain’t no secret that I get around, true
But girl, you make me want to settle down with you
Get a crib with a view, lay up in the bed, make a kid, maybe 2
All my ex-girlfriends gon' have to get a clue
Cause the rumors that you heard about is true

[Hook]



It's a Cole world, it's no allergies, I'm sick late
Can't underlain, niggas fowlin' me, I switch Haynes'
Switch flows up like Mike Jordan switch hangs
Which explains, I'm the shit, you the shit stain
I'm the type of nigga fuck the baddest and forget name
Meanwhile, you be flyin' 'em out
Me, I just be tryin' 'em out
They love it when you hard on hoes
But I'm Magna Cum Laude, niggas smart on hoes
Which means I seen her intentions
The same time I seen her dimensions
Automatic, I might be leanin' to switches
Got good cop on for sisters, but I'm meaner than bitches
Fuck yeah, won't even leave with the digits to say it's vicious
I say it's necessary for a young legendary
Nigga try to throw you orders, ain't nobody ever taught us
Father, forgive us for the shit we do to your daughters
Up in VIP, poppin' bottles like it's water
Used to ride to Starter
Pardon, cause a part of me just want to save the world
But I don't want to be a martyr
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Caught between a rock and hypogamy always
What's stoppin' me? They say I'm a hypocrisy and doubt me
For God's sakes, better that than be a mockery
Ah, fate, don't talk to me



[Produced by J. Cole]

Top, top top, top of the world!

Uh!
I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world

[A.L.]
Uh!
First off, uh, rest in peace Track Willie
Ridin' with me cus, back then nobody pulled for me (Whoo!)
Now I sit back reclined and shine it's all fine
Cus the flow merit status was before my time
I remember daydreamin' when I bust like the semen
Of a heater, said the truth and nobody believed him (Uh uh)
Now the story's fabricated, the public is elated
That somebody from the west considered the next greatest (Who's next)
The Prince (haha), and don't get it twisted (Uh huh)
I spit from the soul but the steez is just gifted
I lived it, talked about him (yeah), ridin' now, we'll walk about it (yeah)
Death of Cornballs like chalk, put the line around it (Haha)
On some D.O.A. shit
No gangsta reality's as real as it gets (Fo' real)
I remember writin' rhymes in the halfway house (Uh huh)
Now I'm sittin' at the top, there's somethin' to talk about

I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)

It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world

[J. Cole]
Uh!
These words go together like a verbal collage
It's murder how the words'll collide
And bring you further from where murderers lie
And maybe you could see a mill, no not no burgers or fries
But give you food for thought, my nigga this is Gerber with rhymes
Servin' up lines for your child like mine, nigga this live
So you think you seen a style like mine, it's a mirage
But I, I'll be obliged like Mary J
Then show you how to strive, when it die like everyday
And nigga stay in court like Perry Mason or Gary Payton
New shoes up on his feet like every week, his mom's interogatin'
Like where you been? Who you been with?
Scared he runnin the streets with them freak and them nitwits
Look up in his face, she see the fatherly resemblence
Read him more than a book
Scared he inherited way more than just looks
But uh, mama I'm on top of the world
Uh! I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world!



[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Sometimes a nigga feel like
Everybody ain't real like Johnny McKinzie
If I could pretend, see, I wouldn't feel right
I bought a Dodge Magnum
I just got signed, everybody on my line
They wanna know the taxes
Do Rock got a mansion? 30K to my moms
The hood turnt up, bitches, bottles, dope and all that stuff
For attention, high hopes and call my bluff
Offended by the notes when I lost love
Things change, people change, niggas change
Bitches change, friend or foe, if or so, pick a lane
Lil Wayne on my single now
Fuckin' hoes like I'm single now
Triggers close to my fingers now
But when the label frozed up, they all chosed up
They tellin' me you a non-believer now
A felony all I could think about
The cars got repoed, the bills they add up
My bitch done left me, I smoked my last one
I'm high with no sleep, I pray a bag come
I just might grab one, I just might blast one of you
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
But I got these wins to gain
And I don't feel comfortable
One thing that I've learnt all of these years
Is to block devils off of my ears
'Cause fairytales don't end well
When the fame and fortune not here
Everybody!

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Promethazine in a baby bottle
Meditatin' on daily dollars
Lately problems stem from my bitch
'Cause she know I still fuck with my baby mama
So there be drama in the house, I gotta find a outlet
Waitin' on a plug just like a fuckin' outlet
Fuck it, I'm turnin' my phone off
Fantasies of grabbin' the heat and burnin' my nose off
Blaow! Niggas might not know but I'm slightly throwed off
And I might need Zoloft, but for now, these Xannies'll do
Hear the sound, a manic depressive
That ain't been prescripted, what can he do?
Anywho, boy, when you got it, you keep a close watch
On the ones that's befriendin' you (Friendin' you)
Them'll be the ones that's envy you (Envy you)
Vividly dreamin' 'bout endin' you (Endin' you)
But when you low, they don't tend to you (Tend to you)
Actin' new when they run into you (Into you)
Fuckin' your bitch tryna feel like you (Feel like you)
This the message I send to you

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Look both ways)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Hmm-mm)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Hmm-mm)
Look both ways 'cause if you cross me, I kill ya

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time (Out of sight)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Rippin' and runnin' wild
My momma say, "Slow it down", I don't listen to her
All of my felonies on file, sippin' liquor 'til my liver ruined
My partner just lost trial
This system'll give it to you when you gettin' to it
How could you calm down?
Cause soon as your guard's down, it's a pistol to it
G-ride special, it's a Buick
I'm guilty but I said I didn't do it
Pressure bust pipes like a gunfight
I ain't never bring a knife to it
I done been through it and I been through it
All the rah-rah, I'm in a high rise
Instead of music and the interviewin'
I could be a nigga dead in a viewin'
Would you take a look inside of my eyes?
I'm surrounded by a bunch of blind guys
Out of sight and out of my mind
But y'all can never see me, checkin' chicken fettuccine
And I wish a nigga would when I'm in this Lamborghini
Top back in the bity, top down on a Bentley
Top Dawg's on the map
We familiar with your ways, we don't even need the app
Sorry but I gotta ask, you runnin' the trap or just runnin' your trap?
I'm runnin' amok, I'm runnin' it up, runnin' across the finish line
Hope you worth more than yo' Rolex
When you run up out of time

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time



[Intro: devdsnow]
*Yovi made this record* (Brrr)
Я прыгаю в такси, двигаю дальше чем могу
Ведь вряд ли что вообще пойму, пока не покурю жирный куш
С homie, движемся на гидропоне
Only, высказав мне более, чем я пойму (Пошел ты нахуй, сука)

[Hook: devdsnow]
Мне похуй, мне похуй, мне похуй
Что ты там пиздишь не слышу
(Я-я-я-я) Я от тебя не завишу
Мне похуй, мне похуй, мне похуй
Что ты там пиздишь не слышу
Или попросту не слушаю

[Verse 1: devdsnow]
Ведь это все одно (Одно) монотонное дерьмо (О, да)
Льется прямо из тебя, но hat'ить дальше буду рад, yah
Буду рад, буду, буду, буду только рад
Обсмоуканая ягода смотрит на меня, oh, god (What?)
Я papira raw, сгибаюсь, разгибаюсь, как хочу (О, да-да-да)
Кручусь, как самый настоящий жирный джони
На iPhon'е нет текстов, они все в голове (Oh, да)
Возникают, убегают, я беру из вне их всех (What?)

[Hook: devdsnow]
Мне похуй, мне похуй, мне похуй
Что ты там пиздишь не слышу
(Я-я-я-я) Я от тебя не завишу
Мне похуй, мне похуй, мне похуй
Что ты там пиздишь не слышу
Или попросту не слушаю

[Verse 2: devdsnow]
Я создаю свой стиль, от начала до конца
Среди зеленых веток я летаю в облаках
И самый новый звук (Звук) свежее твоего iPhon'а
Цифра 7 уже давно влилась, но только в граммах, homie, woop

[Bridge: devdsnow]
Oh, чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт
Чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт
Oh, чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт-чёрт
Oh, чёрт, чёрт

[Hook: devdsnow]
Мне похуй, мне похуй, мне похуй
Что ты там пиздишь не слышу
(Я-я-я-я) Я от тебя не завишу
Мне похуй, мне похуй, мне похуй
Что ты там пиздишь не слышу
Или попросту не слушаю

[Skit: devdsnow & George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee (What?)
I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee that says, fool me once… ([?])
Shame on… (Shame on you, bitch)
Shame on you (Fuck off)
It fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Outro: devdsnow]
Я papira raw, я papira raw
Я papira, я papira, я papira raw
Сгибаюсь, разгибаюсь, как хочу
Я papira raw, я papira raw
Я papira, я papira, я papira raw
Сгибаюсь, разгибаюсь, как хочу
Я papira raw, я papira raw
Я papira, я papira, я papira raw

We don’t cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday
Cause La-Di-Da-Di… (we like to party)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
So in love

So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh na, I get it, I get it, I get it)
Or cause I'm black, hmm, maybe?
Tell me why my hands start sweating and I hold my breathe every time you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pull me over, ya frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me, what do you see?

My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'mma fuckin' try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules

Instead they talk about some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fuckin' a these white hoes
Anchorman stop snitchin'
Cut to commercial, he be textin' all his side bitches
Hey ma-goodness, how ironic

Hey your Honor, is you kidding, how you sit above me?
Are you perfect mothafucka? How you finna to judge me?

[Chorus]
Fell in love through photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Damn, I love your sense of humor
You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fuckin' who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time, stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, yeah
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, feel me

I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (mmm)

[Chorus]
Fell in love through a photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Feel like I gotta say somethin'
Thought of you got my heart jumpin'
But I can't come up with nothin' (no)
But I can't come up with nothin'
I put it off for a day
I come back around your way
Searching for what I could say
That accurately could convey
The way that I feel in the word
That's different than what you done heard
So many done hit you wit game
So many been sent to the curb
And I did not come here to play
And I did not come to observe
And I did not come here to play
But I did not come to observe
Feel me

[Refrain]
Niggas be talkin' so slick (ugh)
I'm not the nigga for lip (yeah)
Puttin' my heart in a click (yeah)
Can't see my heart, it don't fit (yeah)
Don't think I'm built for this shit (yeah)
Too busy thinking what if (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
Niggas be talkin' so slick (yeah)
I'm not the nigga for lip (yeah)
Puttin' my heart in a click (yeah)
Can't see my heart it don't fit (yeah)
Don't think I'm built for this shit (yeah)
Too busy thinking what if (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (mmm)

[Chorus]
Fell in love through photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

(Prod by Dr. Dre, Alchemist, Slim Shady & 6ix)
Sway: sway in da mornin we got new shit comin

Eminem: u motherfuckers never learn, this probs gonn be the last time we puttin mumble rap in its place. we got dre, 50 cent, kenny, logic nd all the homies in the studio. lets go

Token:
I am the real rapper token
Leave all the mumble rappers choken
Thank you logic for the shout out i apreciate it
Now its my turn to destroy mumble rap and go for the big hit
Lil pump ur rhymes are so dump *(dr dre adlib: tell em nigga!)*
We dont wear gucci cause we r not sellout losers like you
Im not a youtube rapper ill destroy you all in the count of 1 and 2
These mumble rappers r so childish unlike donald glover mite as well watch blues clues
Why do we giv clout to dumbass losers like kid buu?
Listenin to mumble rap hell no id rather eat some poo
Kanye the idiot who helped mumble rap takeover just by going poopity scoop *(50 cent adlib: the fuck?)*
Stab mumbe rap in da eyelash
Unlike mumble rap i dont fuck underage girls like billie eilish
I get sick by mumble rap everytime im watchin
Everybody hates mumble rap even bobby tarantino aka logic
Logic doesnt want anyone 2 kill themself but he told me that mumble rappers should
I wish a bitch ass mumble rapper would *(logic adlib: damn right nigga)*
Ill burn playboi carti alive imma make sure dies lit
Lyrical rap is back so mumblers can go join mcdonalds makin fries bitch!
Lorde nd beyonce can taste my dick *(jay z adlib: the fuck?)*
Ill give mumble rap my ass to lick
Yung lean nd ugly god are frauds as fuck fam
Whos next to claim they fucked my bitch god damn

Childish Gambino (Chorus):
You motherfuckers claim 2 be the king of the trap?
Bitch please! ur all just a piece of trash
This is america where the big dogs attack the mumble cats
With the redbone all you motherfuckers do is fap
Here's what i think! slam u mumble fuckers on the mat

On the mat uhh! on the mat nigga! on the mat uh!
On the mat, just a piece of trash!
On the mat uhh! on the mat nigga! on the mat uh! yo! yo!

Joyner Lucas:
The underdog who never lost hope is back
Lucky you mumble rappers cus ur in the presence of the highlight of this rap track
Tory lamez mimik my style he a pure mumble rapper and a fraud
Tory the bitch boy forcing dax and travis scott to apologize well i do not applaud *(dax adlib: IT’S DAX!)* *(Travis scott adlib: straight up)*
You are not litty tory, you are shitty
Cheef keef is the shit i dont like cause he yucky
Your not a gorilla, your a little stupid monkey
Now the nerds are gonna call me racist for saying monkey
Watch out before i get a lil funky
If u got a problem then suck me
Ill turn blueface into redface after i slash his face wit my bars
Slash his face so bad he end up wit scars
Lil xan a whiny litle boy
I play these mumbl rapprs like a toy
Shout out to the legend my homie xxxtentacion
Mumble rap does not deseve to be in the rap nation
Tom mcdonald a fuckin cornball
Puttin my dick in the rap game give em a torn hole
Tekashi got what he deserved, jail time
Lil pumps dumbass saying nigga but he pale white
Stranger things than mumble rap is logic and his shit
Logic may b a good rapper but he a bitch
The type of nigga 2 probbably snitch
The confessions of my dangerous mind is puttin logic and mumble rap to sleep

Chorus (Childish Gambino)

J.Cole:
Yeezy yeezy
Take it easy
U a false prophet nd ur so fucking cheesy
Ur not as good as the likes of g-eazy *(g-eazy adlib: dam right)*
U think ur a god
Well ur nowhere near a god ur a fraud
Pusha t stop hurting my friend drake
U a insecure bitch ur so fake
Daytona album of the year? lol not even close, lame
Ur mumble rappin ass was sad when u lost the grammys now go back 2 sellin cocaine
Lil pump stop running ur mouth remember u are my son
I fathered u on my interview with u now its time to have some fun
I love u pump but no one else does nd we all can't stand ur songs
At this rate ull end up paying chicks to tap them with thongs
So lil pump, come sit on my lap
There's more in life than mixin mumble wit trap
I don’t want u to end up like lil peep dat situetion wud b crap
I'm like thanos destroyin mumble in an instant wit a snap
I collabed with 21 so i could teach him to rap
He still shit didn't learn anything so hes still got a bad rep
Smokepurrp is trash throw hem in the bin
Boogie wit da hoodie is an idiot cut all the mumble rappas limbs
I fuck ur bitchez we on power trip
Eatin mumble rappers like attentin seeka lil xan like im eatin chips *(kendrick adlib: yummy!)*
Mumble rap taking over is so annoyin its making me snarl
In two years the mumble rappers will be kissin james charles
U need to be smart nd intellectual 2 listen 2 my music
These mumble rap doofuses hav no brain thats why they can't listen so they go drug abusin
I sit nd watch mumblers liek lil yachy nd ksi tak l's after watchin rick n morty
Puttin my dick in da earth nd its face cuz im getting horny
1985 i arrived and fathered mumble crappers
Now cum nd lick this dick cuz my testicles u lackers
I got the fire squad this is a tale of two cities
Grab the sword and cut mumble rap then flush em cause they shitty
U won't ever perform in stadiums nd sold out dates and shows cause ur all flops
Soon u mumble rapper crappers will b in love & hip hop *(JCole adlib: nigga)*
Get on my nuts den off my dick shout out 2 JID
Mumble rap defines my album kids on drugs aka kod
Got a problem well you can smd

Childish Gambino: (Chorus)

Eminem:
First off shout out my homie big sean *(big sean: i hear u my nigga big ups!)*
Nd also hopsin, logic, gerald and kendrick for puttin mumble rap to bed like gay porn
You motherfuckers are still a waste of space
You cannot keep up with my fast pace
Tyler creator Nd Vince staples bit my hand so I destroyd em And shat on their face
You say you the king but I am the ace
Your jig is up like my bro jay z
Renegading mumble rappers such as earl sweatshirt tyga nd swae lee
Justin bieber u dumb bitch what do u know about rap?
Go back to makin shit songs cus ur track wit ed sheeran was crap
Khalid sounds like a whale
Killshot on mgk i will not fail
I made a better song with ed sheeran than justin bieber did
Drown this beaver in a river nd let his face cover in blood and red
Nd fuck trippie redd
Put mumble rap babys on da bed
I kill everyone even da feds
Me nd logic raped mumble rap wit waste of space nd homicide this is the last killshot now
Like how i killshot on mgk now everybody time to bow

And ill jab the belly of machin gun kelly
None of u mumblers can hurt me

Soulja boy nd 6ix9ine probs doin it in jail they whack
Dumb bitches worshippin lele pons nd tana mongeua imma go for the smack

Iggy azalea u plastic slut
Im the dog eating ur ass wit my bars u a lil mut
Motherfucks tryna call me racist 4 sayin stupid monkey migos
Migos monkeys not because of their skin cause of their shitty choppy flow
Flush these pieces of trash and waste of space down the toilet cause they shit

50 Cent: GGGGGG UNIT *Beat stops*

Eminem, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Hopsin, Logic, Joyner Lucas, Token, G-Eazy, Childish Gambino & J-Cole all together: FUCK MUMBLE RAP!



[Intro: Correy C]
I hope you figure it out

[Verse 1: Bas]
Shine black man melanin gold
I hope you never get old
Keep your youthful spirit
I know the world will fear it
You're the tip of the spear
And with our dyin' breaths, I bet the world gon' hear it, look
I been saving money for my taxes
Bassy keep on jumpin' through these brackets
I got 20 bitches coming back to the crib
I make sure my niggas got some racks, what you need?
They gon' shoot you niggas like it's practice
I just make the money run some laps
Every time I pass go see the cash grow
We don't even act cordial, we assholes
Bitches in my lasso, is that so?
That's word to my last hoe, I'm that cold
Runnin' through the town a black soul
My past froze twenty-nine times over
Look I have seen more than my time
Lived 9 lives for about twenty cats over, I told ya
Everything you've done I done overdid, I'm over it
Nigga, Dreamville the whole coast how we shouldered it?
Them boys stale like toast when it's overdid
I hope they quit for real
But if they don't I got a million joints
I got the flow in pocket, the emoji rocket how I'm outta here
A lot of em' sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Keeping both eyes open wide rain man
Crew high on that fuck your life drank man
We slide in the bucket like paint
Never gave a fuck, fuck what you might think
Ran up in the club 'till they sent the lights in
Had to tell the owner please let the lights dim
Five more minutes see me a nice slim
Thick bitch with the you, me and my grin
Tell her bring the crew you me and my friends
See where the night end with the right guys
Trust me and my kin, speak with the right pen
Creep like the lightning in the night sky
Go deep Janet Jackson, we back to back in
Black SUV's, black tints would you look at that?
I'm booby-trapped in your fluid black skin
No groupie action, your bougie accent
You're truly classic, girl we outta here

[Bridge: Bas]
Bas, it's Bassy
Queens nigga with the Fiends nigga
Got the bean waitin' in the pocket ooh

[Verse 2: Bas]
I asked P, what's poppin'?
He said we are nigga, trips to DR nigga
Got the borough jumpin' like it's J.R. Smith
Know a couple niggas' let the A-R spit
Got no interest what you say y'all did
Only where y'all live
Smokin' blunts 'cause that's the way I live
And where I live?
Niggas dyin' front of their shorty, wives
And their brother's ride on the other side
Every death is like a 100 lives
Flatlined from the black nine
I could feel the pressure multiplying
Make you feel like ain't no hope in trying
But we always trying
All this blood I bet it float to sea and wash out
'Cause they don't want you to see but watch out
Nigga watch out

[Outro: Correy C + sample]
See I want you to see
I've been through so many things
Things ain't always what they seem
Hope you get the message
I hope you figure it out
Now I'm right where I belong
Had to let it go
All the pain I was holding on
Now I get the message
I had to figure it out
You got to feel the music, do you understand?
It takes you higher and higher



[Intro: Zulema & J. Cole]
God help the hungry children
Help the homeless children
Help them to survive the world they can't understand
Yeah, sip of this ma'fuckin' drink
God help the child who's needy
Who needs love not pity
Lean back, volatile
Help them to survive this cold and bitter land
Yeah
Yeah, hey...

[Chorus (Condensed): J Cole]
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it
Is this the life that You chose for me, Lord?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: J Cole]
This is The Ville, home of the fast-lifers
Where we get high and don't come down, we gas prices
Man, I wonder how hard to live my past life was
'Cause this one hard, I could show you my scars, I ain't cryin' though
Ayy, save that pity for the next man
Or that girl getting beatdown by her ex-man
Ayy, hold your head, mama, I know you wish that nigga dead, mama
If I can find a way to kill him, I won't have nar' drama
Damn mama, tell me who you love
This one is for the boy that see his mama on drugs
I feel your pain, boy, and just know I been through the same, boy
That lady need you more than ever, don't be ashamed, boy
'Cause when it rained, boy, that was your umbrella
The one that changed your pissy sheets when you was a young fella
And now she in the bedroom on her knees
Staring at the sky, screaming "Lord, please!" Tell me now:

[Chorus: J Cole & Omen]
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it
Is this the life that You chose for me, Lord?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it

[Verse 2: Omen]
It's like...
Soon as you cling on my mind's sayin' "be gone"
I leave 'em with wrinkled foreheads, they now Klingons
Confused, 'cause friendship's abused and I'm sorry for it
My life performance been trifling, sometimes I fight my conscience
Was never given spades, but I always had the heart
Always misplayin' the hand that was dealt the joker cards
Is what I was feelin' like, lonely, low energy
Fallin' slow, clinically, ballin'? No, but we finna be
Don't pity me ever, even when them haters answerin'
Mind state of the victor, no victim, I'm just a champion
Money comin' slow, God, intervene
Spirit's never broken, I'm just focused, don't pity me, no no no
You see this pain put a strain on my whole life
I seen the rain, seen my dreams turn to long nights
But all I ask is don't pity me, no, no
Don't pity me, no, no, don't pity me, no, no
No

[Chorus (Extended): J Cole]
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it
Is this the life that You chose for me, Lord?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it
Hey, I can't cry about it
Nuh, gotta be strong, can't cry about it
Hey, uh

[Verse 3: Voli]
Yeah
And I
Freestyle life, can barely write the rent
Yearly income can barely keep this music life in check
Call up mama, "Hate to borrow money with Christmas near
Hey, you know what, how 'bout we make each other gifts this year?"
Friends are calling me up, asking me if I'm signed yet
Who I'm working with? Am I making dollar signs yet?
Disappointment within their voices - do they pity me?
Disbelief - I'ma stay driven like them city streets
But ah, it seems like every day is rainy weather
Can barely fit my pain and pride beneath the same umbrella
But he don't care, he don't care, it's hard to keep em dry
No more caterpillar, now you see him change: peeping Tom
Yeah, this life will flash before your eyes
So get your match before your fire turns to ash, no more drive
No more gas, before you cry, get your last, before you die
Live your past with no regrets, broken necks, no looking back, man

[Chorus (Condensed): J Cole]
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it
Is this the life that You chose for me, Lord?
Is this the life that You chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
Yeah

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Just touched down on the runway
All white on, no Sunday
Step out wave to the haters
Got 'em saying "I'mma be rich one day"
But right now is our time and we winning
Lemme pause, go back to beginning
Seen a chick so bad with an ass so fat
Before the plane took off, I was in her
Got her in the mile high club, she a member (member)
Can't tell you her name, don't remember ('member)
But she took it to the head like a winner (winner)
Had an airplane meal, that was dinner
Lot on her plate, she was pickin’ out
Begging a nigga to dick her out
Now they ain’t lettin’ her back on the plane
Cause the way she was yellin’ and showin’ out
All in first class with the champagne
Sorry lame niggas but you can’t hang
Shawty say she fucking with the campaign
Tap me on the shoulder for the bang-bang
Bang bang bang, do my damn thang
She love the way I beat it up
Say she want it all but then I try, she staying out (damn)
Wanna know how I do it? Girl, I does this shit
And motherfuck the rumors, we above that shit
I just wanna hit the spot, have you in love and shit
If you cool then we can kick it, if you not dismissed

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina]
I can put you in the mile high club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The world is yours" on a blimp?

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine ’bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin’ of the turbulence girl when we turn up
When we land we can roll out, show ya somethin’ you ain’t know about
Tonight we be takin’ off flight with a camera to show out

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Catch me rolling through the city
Riding with the top off
Man my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me baby if ya 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
I can put you in the mile high club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The world is yours" on a blimp?

[Bridge: Jeremeih]
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I’m the pilot
Can’t nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada’s
Make the freaky shit come up out her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine ’bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin’ of the turbulence girl when we turn up
When we land we can roll out, show ya somethin’ you ain’t know about
Tonight we be takin’ off flight with a camera to show out

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
(Cole World, I got it, I got it, I got it, listen)
You need a nigga that’s gon' come over and dig ya out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put ya out
You need a nigga that’s gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big it’s like a foot is in yo mouth
And you ain't babysittin’, but my kids all on yo couch
And oh, you nasty, oh oh, you nasty
Both graduated, so fuck keeping it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you’re softer than a sofa
And so far my new shit’s so fire
Nigga, check my profile
Who ya know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo’ed your bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, lil brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thang in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn don’t make me beg
But I will if I need to cause forreal
Girl, I need ya
I could put ya on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit I got a pill I could feed you

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
I can put you in the mile high club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The world is yours" on a blimp?



[Intro]
This one goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa-ass nigga Thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride
Where playa-hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame muh'fuckers can barely survive

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big
When you in it, fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down

Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk, no

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?

Loud as you can, and ain't nobody gonna hear
Would you like it better if I hit the West Coast?
Tell me baby if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk

[Bridge: Jeremih]

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours" on a blimp?



[Verse 1]
Bustin, I'm going off
Sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp
Like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me
These hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God, but to me she found Satan
She only getting hotter
What's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said: "That's cool nigga
But can you buy the Benz? "
She playin’ niggas like a violin
I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day's found
This is my playground

[Hook]
This is a playground
But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound
Hey now, hey, this is a playground
But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would you lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound
Hey now, hey this is a playground

[Verse 2]
This is a playground, merry-go-round
Like a dream for a nigga
But I swing on a nigga if he push me
I'm makin' moves like the Rutgers
These ain't no monkey bars motherfucker, not a sucker
But these labels throw me deals like the prosecution
Want to underpay me and fuck me like its prostitution
I write that constitution, you know, that classic shit
How you going to own my masters
And you ain't mastered shit?
Give them my ass to kiss, my lawyer laughed at this
Said they was on some bullshit when they drafted this
Like MJ, so I wagged a finger like Dikembe
Until you niggas talking proper paper, no comprende
And now the deals got mills like Wendy's
And got these labels doing bids like inmates
Hoping my pen lays my name down
Until that day's found, this is my playground

[Refrain]



[Verse 1]
Runnin' from cops, for hundreds of blocks
Like Short Dawg before he stumbled
And dropped
Gun in my crotch and its unloaded
I just toat it for fun hoping that one day
They catch me on camera like Gunplay
Gunbutting motherfuckers that's one way
To sell a album
Need all the help I can get
Cause on this shelf that I sit, its real lonely
My fans do they still want me?
They waitin', I am fightin' satan
He think I am his lil homie
These stories are metaphors
They hold a deeper message for those who fed up
Hoping you had my life instead of yours
They say the grass is always greener
The pussy's always cleaner on the other side
Until you mow the lawn with gonorrhea
And you realize you had it better
Way before the cheddar came
Looking back I wanted your respect and never fame
But you know the saying right Jermaine
Careful what you ask for
Cause even when you was mad poor
At least laughed more
Never thought I'd still be proving myself on my sophomore
I understand its been a year and a half since my last tour
But things have changed since I last seen the ring
But the one who seem to claim that he the king got a glass jaw
And I'mma break this shit
Cole World no handkerchief

[Interlude: (Charlamagne Tha God)]
Two classics....
Ahhh fuck, fuck me I was about to go off
(Well at least you wasn't reading off a blackberry
You know I was about to ask you about wondering)

[Verse 2]
Two classics and I am Kobe Bryant on some Laker shit
Fighting to make the playoffs
Writing and taking no day offs
I'm on fire like money hungry company lay offs
No pink slips if loose lips sink ships
Then God dammit ahhhh fuck these niggas Titanics
I am joking, only provoking
In hopes to go number one again
Hoping some rappers disses me just to make this shit fun again
It's no fair
Pac had Mobb Deep and Biggie
And I get left with is Tyrese and Diggy
This is bullshit



[Intro: Harry Mack]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, and if y'all wanna throw out some words too that's cool, you don't have to

One time, I'm the freestyle reporter
Up in LA, we headed south of the border (Government)

[Lion G]

Got me up all night, all I'm singing is love song
She got me up all night, constant talking and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, talk it out with these love songs, she..

[Barz]

Is it safe for me to tell you that I'm falling off this cliff?
I've been hiding all my feelings because ignorance is bliss
As innocent we get we're still counting our regrets
Wondering if we forgive will we finally forget?
I know you've been depressed you've disguised it with a smile
And despite with all the fouls im just tryna stay in bounds
A line between my feelings and the boundaries of tension
If crossed the otherside have I sacrificed our friendship?
Is it worth it? will I be another memory?
I have to let it out because all of this is killin me
Everytime you smile I see the elegance and beauty
Because you are the epitome described into this loose leaf
Excuse me if I compliment your nose ring
The kajol on your eyes how its capturing the limelight
-we started texting you reply an hour late
But we pulled an all nighter gave me hope for the future cuz....

[Lion G]

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me



[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me 20 dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night (All night)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Outro: J. Cole]
Back when I was sleeping in my mama crib

[Verse 1: Game]
She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle, Medellín
In love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, "Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent"
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel
It's me, and I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her?
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door hounding me
Bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me

[Interlude: Game & JMSN]
(When I wake up every day) even though she doubted me
(I thank the lord that we are safe) even though she doubted me
(Again, yeah) even though she doubted me
(That's why you should pray for me)
That's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids
Girl, you can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me, gon' reach out, it's that easy
I love women, cause without women
Wouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'
So let's

[Chorus: Game & J. Cole]
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Cole

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Good girl at heart - I remember you well, I remember you well
Got a husband and kid, but I flirt, hope you do a little dirt
Cause I'm diggin' you still, that's real
But na you don't text back and deep down I respect that
Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit
So, so I fall back, year go by I got more plaques
Just to get a call from you tellin' me you miss me
And you wanna see me next time the tour's back, damn
Well what changed then? She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in
Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been
Well it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up
These other niggas try and fuck
I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what? You ain't been home lately
You ain't heard that nigga? Her man left cause she cheated on his ass
Found her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga
(She burned that nigga)
Say what? She burned that nigga (she burned that nigga)
Say what? She burned that nigga
Dawg, she burned that nigga
He beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid
All cause a bitch burned that nigga
Now dog, that's real ass shit
That's word around the ville ass shit
Did you strap up? Did you the strap up?
Please tell me that you strapped up nigga
We could kill that bitch if you want to
I'm cool, I strapped up, played by the rules, damn
While I'm sittin' here blessed, she at the crib all alone and she stressed
So nigga I

[Chorus: Game & J. Cole]
Pray, bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Just bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head

[Outro: JMSN]
When I wake up every day
I thank the lord that we are safe
Again, yeah
That's why you should pray for me
When I wake up every day
I thank the lord that we are safe
Amen, ooooh
That's why you should pray for me - that's why you should pray



[Verse 1]
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband in

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though I'm never going back

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

[Outro]
I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me



[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Do better, who better?
You better? Been around, like hella, propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your body suit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nothing but magic babe
I be swinging it back and forth, 'til you in your casket, bae, mm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Girl, you want my best side, mm
Bet she from the westside, mm, mm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you askin' me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my Masters see, mm
Throwin' up the peace sign, mm
Girl, I'm from the Eastside, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Girl, you on my best side, mm
Say she from the west side, mm, mm

[Chorus: 6LACK]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I'm lovin' your light, vulnerable
Lettin' your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
To keep alive in the winter time, aye, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulder blades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Like why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneakin' glances thankin’ God that he drew you like that
Beautiful black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart
'Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the west side, mmmm
And she seen my best side, mmmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears



[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Do better, who better?
You better? Been around, like hella, propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your body suit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
Summer came and it left
But love stayed and it’s stuck
And now I carry my weight like a truck
I don’t make music for critics to critique
But because the people need
They need me to lead the way, and so I speak
It's 6LACK pronounce blacker than my skin
Ever since I was a boy, the world told me I should never ever cry
And If I was to ever shed a tear, out of fear, show emotion
I could kiss my credibility goodbye
We were taught to be strong, not knowing the only way to be that
Was to feel like it was safe to open up
Now woman suffer from this gap that we created everyday
I’ma learn and I just wanna say that it is tough
This here is a PSA for every young black man watching
I am not here to talk about my album dropping
Conditioning and the influence exist for a reason
But it's all bound to change like the seasons, seasons
You got pretty little fears, I got pretty little fears too
I’m just hoping I could share
With you
You got pretty little fears, I got pretty little fears too
I’m just hoping I could share
With you



[Verse 1]
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job
Don’t mean to disrespect you
But we’ve been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby yeah if you only knew
I got bigger problems baby, yeah, hey
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn’t know man
It don’t mean nothing to me
Cause right now I got my little boy crying
And my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me
Listen here, I ain't looking for no tears
But my brother got a year
And my Momma keep smoking that shit
On top of that, I’m broke
Please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then ahana...

[Verse 2]
Hey
Dear, Mr. Policeman
Ay am I wrong, ain't you suppose to keep the peace man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me fo'?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh naw I get it, I get it, I get it
Or cause I’m Black, hmmm maybe?
Yeah, hey, tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won’t hear a sound
Man I’m nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see
Thug niggas, drug dealers, it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip gotta motherfucking college degree
And then ahana... unh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my middle finger to the law
I'm busting off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said impossible but I’mma fucking try
Plus how he gon’ tell me, he don't make the rules
There’s niggas dying every day man we don’t make the news
Instead they talking bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fucking all these White hoes
Anchorman stop snitching
Cut to commercial, he be texting all his side bitches
Hey my goodness, how ironic
On trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than a comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding
How you sit above me
Are you perfect motherfucker
How you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day you niggas just like us
You niggas just like us



[Verse]
This is just my check in on a mission tryna find myself
Vexed missing blessings
Tryna find my Wealth
The best
Always dressed
In nothing less than
What's comfortable
Excuse my diction
I been bumping Nas
For a month or two
Watching all the things in this world
That's supposed to be a part of me
Got me ready to make my own Carter Three
See this shit is a part of me
So pardon me
I had to part
My opposition
Had to get my own pot to piss in
Had to make my own bread
Build my own business
I had to make it past chilling in the hood business
Seeing my dad really put me in a different state
Fuck what I been running for
I'm lost in another race
The one for my soul
The one against my demons
The one I drink away
The one that keeps me scheming
Late at night to be a star
You know I call it dreaming
It's not about the fame I mean that
I really mean it
But let me tell you the truth
And why I do this here's the reason
I promise you it's not no corny shit
I'm really speaking
I wanna save lives first and foremost
Cuz I remember Chance The Rapper saving me from jumping outta dorm rooms
But I also need money
Cuz my family ain't got it
And see I got a talent
That could fill up mom's wallet
So for me to not get paid
Is literally me wilding
You gotta understand
My life won't be like yours without it
And I cannot just chill
And wait to perish at the bottom
So you gon have to hear me
Make my way thru all my problems
Cuz Nigga I am legend
Fresh Prince but I ain't rich
I'm a dog
Kinda small
But ain't never been bitch
Problem 1
Nigga, I was broke last year
I couldn't afford shit
Almost sold dope last year
Just weed
You know in case I make it with this dream
This next one in line
Behind balling in the league
See I cannot fail
Because my pockets so frail
Worst part of my day
Was putting up with Auntie yells
Then Nic called
You know that's my big dawg
He said we gotta hit New York
You a big fish don't get small
So he took some dollars
He coulda gave to his daughter
And put em on a nigga that he knew would take this farther
I was scared as fuck
I even fainted on the plane
Cuz I knew this was it
I'd never see the bay the same
We
Got up in them offices
Gave em a good listen
Told em' I could see the future of the game
I got a vision
I can change the whole thang
Like when Jordan met Pippen
I know you see the same
Nodding yo head while you listen
I know that I got a thing for being the best out
Respected like D-Rose
Savvy like Steve Stoute
Dipping on these hoes
Blowing my weed out
Fixing my Yankee cap
Rewriting my daily raps
I swear I'm the cleanest out
Cole I need a beat
Like you need a damn haircut
Cole I need a beat
Got some bars
You wouldn't dare touch
See at least you fucking with me now
I was scared first
I didn't wanna let you down
Peace to who wears the crown
Look around
Now I swear It's different in the world for guys like us
Not just emcees
Niggas who really say real stuff
Including Lil Uzi, 21, Kodak, Tee Grizz, Lil Yachty, Denzel Curry, Migos, Rae Sremm, Rich Homie, and of course my nigga Thug
All my dawgs painting what our childhoods was
You get no love
If you hating
On a young man
Stacking up his chips
Like he finna go all in
The system want us missing
I can see they hate the vision
I'm done tryna play the game for niggas that's just sitting
I'm done tryna be the guy
That's getting all the bitches
I just wanna touch the sky
And bring you all there to witness
I just wanna touch the sky
And bring you all there to witness

[Hook]
So let me spread my wings
Aye let me spread my wings
So let me spread my wings
Aye let me spread my wings
So let me spread my wings
Aye let me spread my wings



*Hook*
Say I'm Proud To Be Hmong
H.M.O.N.G
That's Who I Am & That's Who I'll Always Be
Aggression Taken The Day That We All Was Birth
Let These Suckaz Know How much We All've Been Hurt
I Say I'm Proud To Be Hmong
H.M.O.O.B
That's Who I Am & That's Who I'll Always Be
Believe In(G) Lies Was So Wrong I Tell It All
And Let 'Em All Know EveryBody Sing Along

*Verse 1*
Living life without an answer
And unsolvable questions
Hoping God will hear our prayers
As we sit here and listen
But Oh No!
I guess this life for us is tragedy
Believe in me
I try to make us see the image that we want to see
And if we help the damn U.S
But we ain't even treated with the same respect
Explain that!
My brothaz on crack
They try to fight back
Drug convinced
So you know that they ain't never fight back
My sistaz on knees
They wanted y'all to see
A good women of Hmong
Live in communities
But y'all was too blind to realize
So fuck off
Don't let me change my damn mind
With Real lies
And if we plead
To what we believe
A damn change will lead
The life that we wanna see
So bare along with me
As we sing this melody
For my Hmong OGz
Uhh
My H.M.O.O.B

*Verse 2*
So it has come down to this
Racist niggas deserve to get diss
They talking many shit
How we Hmongs couldn't make it
Now I'm here to speak the truth
Let us rise as a leader of youth
Brains be planted like the roots
I'm here to show ya
I'm Tony Vue
I'm coming thru
Showing all my fellow gooks
Showing that we real we true
So keep your fist high and fight for your life
They say life is a test but are they right
Trouble seems to be attached to us like magnets
No time to wait for homos & faggots
Just live your life & just love it
Cause most of us will never make it
Only take some to say it
So take this opportunity and take it
I promise you You'll need it
No time to even waste it
With all these hesitation
And muthafuckaz complaining
We own this muthafuckin' game
So rep Hmong All the way
And say H.M.O.N.G Nigga, Yeee!

[Intro: Sam Evans]
Caught up with the audience
Caught up with the audience
'Cause you're out of view
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying, but I cannot save you

[Verse 1: Bas]
I can't
City to city, a young legend fulfillin' my dreams shattering ceilings
It got me feeling myself
Look how I'm fittin' the belt, they never give me a chance
I never give 'em a breath, keep a foot on they neck
I go deep to the depths, submerged in it
I'm getting the urge, nigga
I'm killin' these niggas off, call me the purge
I just been peelin' the feelings off
Layers of inner thoughts, you're playin' 'em in your car
But really you're in my head like yarmulke synagogues
Bassy been a problem, they probably never could solve
Like me at the bottom, they probably got better odds
Than knockin' the rings off of Saturn
Find it hard to settle, I want it all forever
The speech, it don't get me bothered and the streets, you ain't get involved in
Y'all sweet like some kindergarteners
I got heat and I'm feeling heartless, heartless
I been makin' all these songs just for you to hear
Get these niggas outta here like the Uber here
'Bout to switch another gig, kill another year
Gang, Dreamville run the game and we come for e'rything, man
If we ask, they abide, pain from the sacrifice
Had to leave my other half on the side
I just laugh when my stock on the rise
Stack all this cash, couldn't've overdraft if I tried

[Chorus: Bas & Sam Evans]
I need to reset myself (Without you)
I won't neglect myself (With-without you)
I had to test myself (Without you)
I think I'm at my best (With without you)
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying but I cannot save (You)

[Verse 2: Bas]
I can't
These pups ain't war-ready
Gettin' lost in the city like Doc Gooden, Strawberry
When the block hot tell Cosby I got puddin' already
In the drop top, bitch hop in it already
Yellin' "Fuck the cops," middle fingers to the opps
Stop with it already, y'all efforts get nothin' but F's
Y’all crampin' my style but I got hot with it already
This for the phony and the sleep
Throwin' up the goat emoji, niggas lookin' like some sheep
Presidential Rollie on me, bitch, I'm rollin' like a sheik
You ain't know, you ain’t low, I can call you in my sleep
Took my girl to Japan to do some shopping and, man
I could show you new options
Do what you want when you poppin'
Made a few loans to my partners to put a hole in your top
Just to spend a week in Colombia fuckin' hoes, eating tapas
Damn, if we ain't home, they adopt us

[Interlude]
I live round here, I live round here
Look at the strength!

[Chorus: Bas]
I need to reset myself (Without you)
I won't neglect myself (Without you)
I had to test myself (Without you)
I think I'm at my best (Without you)
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying but I cannot save (You)

[Outro: Sam Evans]
Caught up with the audience
Caught up with the audience
Caught up with the audience
Caught up with the audience
'Cause you're out of view
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying, but I cannot save you



[Chorus: Take 6]
I need you, more than ever
More than ever
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I need you, more than ever
More than ever
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I know I need you

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know I need you, baby
So much on my mind, I ain't even really sleepin' lately
I said some things I didn't mean, I know I did too much
What's love if we can't get into it, turn around and make up?
You kept it solid from beginning, baby, you my day one
You caught me in a lie, looked back up at you like I'm dumb
I had to make you my girl, you ain't afraid to speak up
No matter where we are, who it is, you still gon' tee up
Go through withdrawals when we apart, get back together, re-up
You stayed ten toes down, now you can kick your feet up
I had to boss you up, I had to level up myself
I did some growin' up, I'm doin' better for myself
But I still need you

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Take 6]
I need you, more than ever
More than ever
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I know, I need you, more than ever (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
More than ever
I need you, more than ever (Ooh yeah, oh)
I know that I'm in trouble (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, oh)
I know I...

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Uh, I got a laundry list of the sh** you done did for me
God, pulled out a rib for me
She pushed out a kid for me
When I'm gone, you hold down the crib for me
You know you wouldn't last in no prison
You told me straight up you ain't doin' no bid for me, uh
The Lord, He blessed you with common sense
Too many good b****** behind the fence
For lyin' to feds for n***** that climb in bed with thotties
If I ever catch me a body, I'll make you a promise, you won't know about it
I can't get you caught up in messes I made
Love you forever
When we turn like 50, I'm still gonna have all of your messages saved
Purple emojis with horns on it
Like the devil, but ain't nothin' devilish, babe
In fact, it's a Heaven-sent thing
Black angel with the regular name
F*** strangers, I could never contain my passion for you
I'm grabbin' on you in public, I know that you love it
I'm tryna put one more lil' boy in your stomach
No frontin', I keep it one hunnit
If you was to leave me, I know I'm gon' plummet
I know I'm gon' plummet

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Take 6]
I need you, more than ever
More than ever (I need you)
I need you, more than ever
I know that I'm in trouble
I know, I need you (I need you)
More than ever (More than ever)
I need you, more than ever (Need you)
I know that I'm in trouble (That I'm in trouble)
I know I...

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Yeah hey

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, Big dreams
Nice night or So it seems
Stroll in the club with her tight fit jeans
Praying that she might get seen by a nigga with a contract
With a sports team or just a nigga that you figure could afford things
Like more rings for her fingers
She used to fuck singers but said they too soft, Just copped a new loft
For you walk into her crib got to take her shoes off
Thats only step one your dress is next hun
You say your kid sleep, I don't want no step son
But lead the way to your bed room, king size bed so we got leg room
She give Queen like head so we got head room, my God
Than I work her like its my job
Her moans is like music to my ears iPod

And than I hit the door, cause baby I got to go
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know
I know you've been through this before

[Hook]
Check it, I make the rich bitch beg
Make the good girl steal
Make the old ladies blush
Make the young hoes squeal
For real, for real

[Verse 2]
Good girl huh, father was a preacher
Sent her off to college thought he got her on a leash though
From the outside man them girls be the squeakiest
You get 'em inside them girls be the freakiest

Mischievous, downright devious
Say she want cake I got all the right ingredients
Running round fronting like a pure white virgin
Gave a nigga dome while her father gave a Sermon
Amen, let the choir sing
She be walking round campus like the quiet thing
Some niggas scared to approach when they admiring
Man if they know like I know she got that fire thing
Pour a little OJ with some P-trone
I'm feeling ok, but homie she's gone
When remmy Rev called she just ignore him
I had her calling on God 'til the wee morn
And than I hit the door nigga

Cause baby I got to go
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know
I know you've been through this before

[Hook]



[Intro]
J. Cole
Haha uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, Yo
Bear with a nigga man
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?
I'll still kill it nigga
Show y'all niggas how it do
Real Quick

[Verse 1]
Uh You know what they say;
The window to the soul is in the eyes
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blinds
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the Super Soakers
I got 'em so wet
Fuck that Moet, I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking
Nervous? nigga, please
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, its like a nigga be baking
Watch so cold, it's like the shit will need blankets
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones
Hit and run, bigger funds
But still can't forget to pour liquor
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny
So I do what's best for me
I know you fake niggas well, ain't no test to me
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe for that
So nigga chill or the tec will speak, "Blaaat!"
Them niggas will put you chest to feet
I'm talking reckless
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted
Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us
Looking for model divas that barely speak English
Fuck 'em while we rich, cuz when we broke, they gonna leave us
We earn stripes, looking like zebras
Y'all looking like Adidas
We do it for the streets, cuz they need us
Got beef? Come meet us
Ok I thought so
Y'all niggas are so mad cuz I floss so bad on bitches
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso
Make her stomach feel the fossil
Now she yelling out God so much thought I had her singing gospel
Shit, shout out to my apostles
Ya know me
Nicest nigga in the south
Yea you can quote me!

[Outro]
Wooo Shit!
Haha
Ooooh Shit, mother fucker!
Hahaha
Oohh Shit
And I'm sick bitch, holla at me!
You know!
Fuck boy!!



[Verse 1]
Hey
Yeah, uh
Yeah
Lost in the world like Siddhartha while I author these quotes
Cutting hoes like a varsity coach
Caught fire no Larceny, please you gotta pardon these boasts
A lot of niggas pray to god that he choke
Never see the album drop Fall off and be broke
Reminiscing on the hard times, so often he'd hoped to slip his foot in the door
Promise when I made it I’d write my hooks for the poor
But now I'm hella Faded and got my foot to the floor while I'm pushing this Porsche
Seem to be more concerned with how I look in the Source
Staring in the mirror just to see a look of remorse
Take a look at my chain, look at what I've became! (Man)

[Selah Sue]
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say this' my song for you, my friend
And you can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no oh yeah
So listen to the sound of my voice
Your brothers sending all my love
Is giving me no choice no no no
Listen to the sound of the point, ha!
Ragamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handeling a choice and I know, that

Believed he could change the world, and he did
Now he sits alone, used to write poems
But that's gone it's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair, and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stare, or will I ride

[Hook]
Dear ragamuffin is one of the band (ride)

The raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end
But what you're ever gonna, gonna do, I don't know
And the raggamuffin shall not fall down
Because he has the wisdom not to fool around
But why did you have to leave the good sense on the ground, yes

Believed he could change the world and he dared
Now he sits alone
Used to write poems but that's gone
It's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stare
Or will I ride

[Hook: Selah Sue]



[Intro]
Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system
DJ OnPoint

[Verse]
Damn, broke as a bad joke, but still I laugh though
Frontin' tryna have hope, it's sad though
I'm tired of being broke as shit
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6
Aye man, I just graduated, good old college degree
Shit, my niggas drug dealing see more dollars than me
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thing
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like, "You a lame
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man you insane"
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga 'bout to be though
So give me one year then play this back like TiVo
'Cause boy I'm finna blow, I'm a motherfuckin' torpedo
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquito, uh
I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit
Feel like a goddamn kid, man I'm Pac and Big (What up?)
"Up" is something that I can't give
Won't see me disappear like the old Ant Viv'
'Cause even on a slow jam, I'm so damn sick
Man I even spread a virus to a program-quick
I gotta focus on my flow and get some dough, man, shit
No dollars got me actin' like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and to my ex-lady
Yeah we been complicatin' things with the sex lately
Maybe I'm being selfish, but nah, I can't help it
'Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtic, Jersey
Regardless of where God lead us
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina, uh
But I'm through living in the past, Lord
No more thinking rewind, I'm more fast forward
Less rear-view mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizin' cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my mom a whip, nigga, and she ain't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle, nigga
I'd like to welcome ya'll to
My life, my life, my life, my life, in the sunshine... (Okay, in the sunshine)

Essa é daquelas que eu ouvia na 24 de maio, voltando pra casa
Enquanto eu cavo a cova rasa de todo mundo que confunde minha morte com desmaio
Eu não caio com essa base, sou argumento, então se embasa
Que eu venho e corto as asa de MC de ideia faia
Yoga fire e sua alma rasa é fria como o Malafaia
Que mata quem destoa, eu concordo em discordar
Eles te botam pra dormir e eu vim aqui pra te acordar
Rimar sobre ser o mais foda, o maior, o que fode mais
Quem é foda não fala, é conhecido porque faz
E ter dinheiro não é meta, eu nasci rico, que se foda
Ou seja eu tinha no meu berço o que tu quis a vida toda
Eu gravo clipe de Mercedes, e nem alugo essa porra
E se a vida é 100 metros, te aconselho que corra
Fedelho discorra, me disse o mestre na masmorra
Da mente, de quem assim como você é inconsequente e mente
Mente que é feliz quando não é
Mente que chegou até aqui a pé
Eu sei as carona que tu teve, na tevê deu pra ver
Eu vi você tirar teu Nike pra gostarem de você
Se o rap é teu trabalho, e tu faz obrigado
Eu não sou obrigado a respeitar, ô seu arrombado
Quando for fazer com amor, que a traição te doa
Porque esse game todo aí é na cabeça das pessoa

Que se foda o rap game, e se eu morrer amanhã
Que eu leve todas as crews, e todos os fãs
São fruto de ideias banais e filosofias vãs
Pra vender camisa cara, tênis quicksilver e vans


Foda-se, foda-se o game, foda-se você, foda-se eu
Foda-se o que a gente não aprendeu
Meu medo é ser mais um, que deu certo ou errado
Minha meta é ser o Um que não é apontado
Disaponto minha família, meus amigos, quem convive
Quando falo sobre a sina de quem tenta e nunca vive
Mas, essa é a última, juro, e eu vou embora
Sei quando não sou bem-vindo nem do lado de fora
Na era dos parnasianos eu quis ser realista
Realizei que nesses anos eu nunca toquei na pista
E mesmo tocando na alma, nunca tive meu valor
Valorizei as coisas erradas, tipo letra e amor
E quem amou não divulgou, continuei esquecido
Não devo ser tão bom assim como dizem os amigos
A culpa é minha, que acreditei nesse conto de fada
Se eu não levo o rap a sério ele não me leva a nada



[Intro]
I'd rather be with you babe, yes I do
I'd rather beeeeee with youuuuuuuuuuuu

[Hook]
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey
Ay though I love you hate that bitch that's always with you
A Shame I gotta put up with her shit just to get you
She threw another fit you had to split because she was wit you
And now I'm at the crib all alone damn I miss you
Ay when we first met you was too tense for me to get through
And then I got you loose it's like a glove how I fit you
Your two lips they smell like tulips so official
My niggas'll probably clown me if I told 'em that I kissed you
But you clean as a whistle wet as a tissue in the toilet
Love to hit that spot get you hot like I boil it
Even let ol' girl watch she enjoy it
Even though she make it hard for me to see you
Knowing that I need you
Now look, don't make a grown nigga beg that ain't fair bitch
Just take them clothes off oh look you got your hair did
For me looks good she said oh you so sweet
Now get me while you can you bout to have to wait a whole week
Ah hell not the beast really I don't give a fuck
Well since you already bleedin' that mean I don't get to cut
Ay look I'm already fienin' so just let me slide thru
Tell your homegirl relax and let me get inside you
Because that booty mad thick behind your juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi in this bougie ass chick
The only reason that I put up with this moody ass bitch
Is... you

[Hook]
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather
Rather be, (Now baby its... you) rather
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah
She said I love you she talks tellin' me to kiss her up
But when her friend visits I doesn't get it much
Its soo-woo season and shawty dick teasin' now for that reason
Now my shit is like a crip sneaker
Listen love of my life, I'm tryin' to get some, a-
-ttention. You don't gotta listen just give a fuck
Your mouth, I don't need, your legs, you can keep
Just tryin' to get up in your jeans re-sew your seams
And your pussy was the cameo but stole the scene
So I got my camera on your cameltoe say cheese
Two lips blowin' kisses, muah to my mistress
Goodbye to my girl when I'm in it
I'll take you out shorty but let me know its mine
I'll paint you with my tongue and stay in those bikini lines
See it's a part of you I gotta be a part of
But every other part of you make me wanna depart and
Baby look at what you started, why am I working for it
Why are we still conversing when I'm sure you've heard the chorus
I'm sure you get the point and I prefer you throw it urgent
Your mind can say no but she can't control the urges
Because your booty mad thick behind them juicy ass lips
Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm through with that shit
The only reason why I put up with this stupid ass bitch
Is because of you

[Hook]
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Uh, and how I wish I would've met you first
Never had a chance to try
Cause your overprotective friend saw the lust in my eyes
So you she would hide cause she thought of me as a typical guy
Which you know I'm different, right
You listenin' to her is leaving you with empty nights
Recognize shawty, be real with ya'self
Mama feelin' herself literally
And I wondering if her mission is to get rid of me
Cause every time you come by to kick it
And I open up the door you bring her cranky ass with you
Influencing your decisions I can't even get a minute
Without her making attempts to garner all of my attention
She talk and I don't listen, I'm just picturin' me stickin'
And movin' you moanin', music on the counter in the kitchen
Spitta be that nigga bitches reachin' for my zipper
Cause they figure that's the way to my digits I beg to differ
Lifted like the research group, I so get it
She know you'll never be the same if I hit it
You know you longing for the stroke so you drippin'
She smoking and that'll be the scapegoat for slippin'
Oooo your booty so thick behind them juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm thru with that shit
The only reason that I put up with this bougie ass bitch
Is... you

[Outro]
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather beee with youuuuuu




1. J.Cole first off I loved Born Sinner! My question is why did you create the website stream for the album before it even came out?

Cole - so fans didn't feel so bad for listening early
2. What did your homie who was disappointed your first Dead Presidents freestyle think of the second one?

Cole - he was silenced forever. wasn't my homie, knew him through somebody else. but he's on Mute now
3. If there was one thing you could've done differently music-wise, what would it have been?

Cole - sell Friday night lights
4. What is one musician you love that most people would not expect you to listen to?

Cole - Eric Clapton
5. Hearing that you're a big Outkast fan i'll ask you this; ATLiens or Aquemini?

Cole - DAMN. That's tough. But Aquemini
6. Can you speak on your favorite track on Born Sinner?
Can you speak on your production process you took on Born Sinner?

Cole - First answer! Favorite song is too hard to decide. But I will say Runaway is definitely in the running. The verses!
Production process is an easier question to answer for me. I just let it FLOW. Normally I start out by finding drum sounds and patterns that make me move. for instance, Runaway started by flipping a real dirty drum loop, then adding a harder kick on top. Once i get drums that Move me and excite me, I look to add music (samples or something i'm playing) that make the marriage complete
Born sinner plays with a lot of Double time tempo's. Shit like power trip, that moves your head as if it's fast paced. but in reality, its technically a SLOW beat. The breakdown on LAnd of the Snakes another example. Or rich niggas
Thanks for the question
7. What internet sites do you frequent, non-music related?

Cole - can i be honest? without getting killed off by Reddit community. I go to Digg a lot. I know Reddit ethered Digg a while ago, because of the amazing COMMUNITY experience of reddit. But I still rock with them
Don't taze me bro
8. Why wasn't the beat that was used in the first Born Sinner uStream used on the album?

Cole - Didn't like the verses on it! they were hard but sometimes a beat is so good it's overpowering and intimidating. that beat is like that
9. What did you have for lunch today?
Also, what's your favourite music video?
Yo i got another one, what's your favourite kind of booze?

Cole - haven't eaten yet today. you just reminded me that i need to eat
10. Have you received any feedback (positive/negative) about your “Faggot” bars on Villuminati?

Cole - yes. i'm a communications major, studied PR. I knew what I was getting into. The comment I gave to Huffington Post was genuine and the reason why I wrote those bars. The line even makes me uncomfortable, but it's worth it for the sake of the conversation
11.  What was the most meaningful song on Born Sinner?
To me it felt like you poured your heart out and went all in on this album. Love the work. Keep it coming, you're for real, man. Changing the game..

Cole - There is a lot of MEANING on the album. so most meaningful is hard. But I really love the title track "Born Sinner." Because even though there's lots of pitfalls, temptations, dangers, and tribulations on the album, it ends in a hopeful place with "i'm a born sinner, but i'll die BETTER than that" listen to those verses for more clarity. plus i touch on the things that are really important to me. relationship (got her life in my grip), family (she hate the way she raised me but she loved what she raised), friends (if i died today my nigga was it business, was it personal?)
Thank you
12. Kid Cudi self-produced the whole album, Indicud, like you did on Born Sinner. What is you personal opinion on INDICUD?

Cole - I haven't heard INDICUD because I was working on my album. But I'm really mad at myself for not finishing a verse for that album in time. Got in the studio with Cudi and he was cool as shit. Good dude. I never did my verse and the joint was harddd
13. One thing that I think everyone here wants to ask: Can you tell us anything new about your upcoming album with Kendrick Lamar? I really love Born Sinner by the way, can't wait to see where you go next, but I want to emphasize how good what you're doing right now is. And thanks for doing this AMA!

Cole - Thank you. This question will be asked a lot so I'll just answer it here. We have some really good songs in the stash, but haven't had a chance to properly work on a project. An album will come in the future, but probably not this year. I'm just happy for my niggaaa
14. How did it feel when you heard Nas on Let Nas Down Remix?

Cole - Surreal. Today is my first day off in a LONG TIME (other than this. but this isn't WORK) I plan on soaking in that moment tonight and really reflecting on how amazing that is
15. What made you want to work with James Fauntleroy? He is incredible

Cole - This is weird. You asked me a question. And then answered your own question
16. did you have a fan base before you you got signed?

Cole - yes. i called them friends
That was it really. few hundred people had heard The Come Up, and School Daze was popping on my myspace page. No buzz though. Just skeelz
17. Favorite nba team?

Cole - no real team loyalty. just follow players now. Looking for a home. my last favorite team was the KNICKS because Penny Hardaway's last real playing years were there (and i just happened to be in NYC for college). Before that it was the Magic, then the Suns. NEVER FAVORITE A TEAM BECAUSE OF A PLAYER, when he leaves you're gonna be lost in the world
18. So....have you met Jay Electronica? How's he like?
Who's your favorite celebrity that you've met/would like to meet?

Cole - jay electronica has the most phone numbers out of anybody i ever met. He changes his number every 16 hours
19. How did you celebrate the release of born sinner?
Cole world

Cole - got twisted tuesday night with friends and fam in NYC while feeling really grateful and relieved and blessed and happy
20. COLE I HOOKED YOU UP WITH THAT GIANT BORN SINNER PIC BY YOUR NAME, PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE YA BOY'S EXISTENCE

Cole - acknowledged
21. Congratulations on Nas's remix to your joint Cole!
Listening to your songs I often get chills. Songs such as God's Gift, Return of Simba, See it to Believe it and too many songs off of Born Sinner! Has there ever been a song you've heard whether it be from Nas or someone else that has blown your mind and influenced your style greatly?

Cole - Nas- Undying Love Eminem- Stan just mind blowing concepts tons more of course from more than just those rappers
22. Why Did you try and compete with Kanye on the 18th? Wouldn't it make more sense to have your album release on a day with less competition?

Cole - Just followed my instincts. I was confident in the album I had. Didn't know what he had, but didn't care. Wanted to start the conversation. I've had a #1 album before. It's cool. But I wouldn't have been able to live with myself wondering "what if I would have moved my date?"
23. Hi J. Cole. I have a few questions for you but first off I would like to say thank you for taking time out of your day to do an AMA here on HipHopHeads. I've been a big fan of yours ever since my friend at school introduced me to some of your songs last year. I really wanted to come to your Atlanta show a couple of days ago and support you and buy some merchandise but I found out that there was an age limit, and I am only 15
What are your favorite things to do outside of rapping?
What job would you like to have if you didn't rap?
What has been the hardest part of your rapping career so far?
Do you think of yourself as "famous" now that you have had two successful albums?
Are you going to be releasing any winter merchandise for Born Sinner? I would really like to have a hoody with the album art on it and wear it all around my campus
Thanks again for doing this AMA, I am looking foward to future album and mixtape releases

Cole - If I didn't rap I have no clue what I would want to do. Would take a lot of self re-evaluating to figure that out. Too much passion for music to think of something else right now
Hardest part of my rap career so far was finding the balance. How to become a mainstream artist without losing myself. Took a lot of experimenting, trying things, sometimes failing. But I found it
Born Sinner CROWN Hoodies on the way
24. What did yourself and Drake do with all those copies of the album you bought?
What was your first feeling when the album leaked so far in advance?

Cole - I don't even know what happened to those copies. Hopefully they gave them out to the people
My first feeling when the album leaked 12 DAYS IN ADVANCE. was "oh fuck"
25. Thank you for doing this AMA J. Cole, to see my favorite rapper come to my favorite online community is really something special
3 days before Sideline Story dropped I was at your concert in Tampa, and you shouted me out at the end while doing Farewell, I was the white kid wearing a Dreamville shirt, here's a picture of me from that night http://imgur.com/dtNJLZ1 When you have your next concert in Tampa, or the closest other venue, I plan on wearing a shirt that says "Produce with J. Cole or Die Trying" I would really just like to get some advice on producing, it's become something I love to do, and you are amazing at it
Anyways, my question for you is how does it feel to have your idol, Nas, rap over your own song, saying that he is proud of you?
Thank you once again, I've been a fan since The Warm Up, and your music has gotten me through some very hard times. Sorry for fan girling, but I've seen in interviews how you've talked about how much you liked Nas as a kid where it felt like you knew him, and that's exactly how I feel about you. Keep making amazing music, and thank you for helping bring back the real

Cole - thank you. i'm going to do a real tour in the fall
I answered the Nas question. Really just wanted to say thank you for listening. And I just heard we beat Edward Snowden for #1 on Reddit. AND I AIN'T HAVE TO BETRAY THE US GOVERNMENT!!! jk jk jk jk (does anyone still use jk.. felt like a 12 year old girl typing that)
26. What are your favorite shows on TV? (More importantly, do you watch Breaking Bad?) lol

Cole - Newsroom is my favorite show. House of Cards too. Breaking Bad is incredible, I only saw the first 2 episodes and planned on watching every episode of every season to catch up. But never had time. So NO, I don't watch it but wish I could
27. Hey Cole. Born sinner is easily the best album that came out on June 18th and your production and rapping was on point. I got two questions for you
1) Why did you decide to not have any guest features spit a verse on Born sinner?
2) When can we expect your collab album with Kendrick?
Thanks for doing this ama Cole!

Cole - Thank you! By the time I was wrapping up the album, I started doing interviews and getting questions about features. I didn't have any rap features, and I felt pressure to ADD some, but quickly realized that I had already said what I wanted to say on this album. The mentality was "who says you HAVE to have other people rapping on your album?"

2) Don't want to put a date on it
28. If you could, would you have done Born Sinner differently?

Cole - nope




[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It’s ya nigga, deep thinker, big drinker
Late night, with ya wife in ya crib sneaker
When you out of town, and you not around
Turn your ass over like a nigga stepped out of bounds
Crowd around young’n
I got ammo and a lot of rounds coming
Up in the streets where you not allowed, runnin’
Got the songs bitches ride around hummin’
And the niggas stay thumpin’
And the hater’s hate pumpin’
Got the 808′s bumpin’
So the trunks stay thumpin’
And the nigga get high only on occasion and
My mind too wild
Damn thought weed supposed to calm you down
But I’m so high I could palm two clouds
Boy look, these niggas quote my lines like the Lord’s book
You niggas less rhymes more hooks
More bucks but less love
You hear them drums, Questlove
No Roots, I’m so truth
I used to rock sidelines like a coach suit
Had to look at all them loafers, yeah them boat shoes
Now I’m in the game but I won't boast to you dummy
Remember niggas had short jokes for my money
Toast to the honeys, money and the liquor
And bitch I don’t sound like any other nigga
With my finger on the trigger
I burn rappers like Henny on the liver
Grant death wishes like a genie I’m a killer
Lord giveth and he taketh like an Indian giver
Hard to keep jimmy in zipper
When you got them bad Aunt Vivians with ya
Remy and weed, I got em on Pluto
I prefer Henny but the hoes like Nuvo

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Check, every time a nigga roll
Old school whips and it’s sitting on vogues
Hoes on me when I enter the door
If a nigga wanna trip, good grip on the chrome
Empty out a clip from the fifth then I’m gone
Twist up a spliff, get a fifth of Patron
Hate a chick who just talk shit on the phone
Baby I’m tryna stick, give ya dicks to ya dome, shit
If I was you nigga I would hate him
Hot August nights I’m out there in Vegas
Stuntin' til time, had that patience
Now it’s big faces, fly vacations
Alias Shawn Stacks
Miss shows, never call back
Blowin’ Dro sippin' tall cats
On the low had to crawl back
Niggas wonder if it’s all raps
Or it’s all facts

[Verse 3: Omen]
As I step in the door like Fe fi foe
With the heat like flow and the beat typo
Better rewrite yo, get your rhyming straight
Get murked plus 8 like Jon and Kate
I mean it’s time for the face off
Hit the corner like an 8 ball
Man I concentrate like Adolf
No time for a hater, get a day job
Me on the mind you ain't even on the radar
Love her brain but I never been a fiend for her silly ways
So I’m tryna get the cream til I’m silly paid
Couldn’t put her on the team, every week another reason
To scheme like Billy Mays
Gotta grind gotta focus
Gotta shine through the minds of the blind, lot of hopeless
Never confined to the rhymes that I’ve chosen
Omen, a sign of the times, gotta quote this



[Chorus: JID]
You don't give a damn, then we don’t give a fuck
On God, I been waitin' for one of y'all pussy niggas to buck
Still starving, ribs touching
Touch the team and you get touched like homescreen buttons
Hoes scream loud, Jennifer Hudson when them thangs start bustin’
Alright

[Verse 1: JID]
Shit talk and slick talk
Pissed off, stick talk
Diss track, get mad
Rap niggas big trash
Your squad, my squad
Mismatched, pissants
Cheese chase, gym rats
Picture paint, Rembrandts
Tree trunk, thin branch
I leave, come back
This fall, diss all y'all niggas I came up with
My, what a bit of a change up
These niggas lame, we in minimal danger
I got the banger, just give me the next
My nigga put me in the game and I'm ready to flame, I'm anxious
Put the motherfuckin' bank on it

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Big nuts hangin', big bucks bringin', fuck 'em all
No slut shamin’, money in the Cayman, I’m appalled
Niggas swear they bangin', feds got ’em singin' on the squad
Crack rock slangin' on blacktop pavement, tryna ball
Line 'em up on the wall, three deep, final call
Knee-deep, squeeze three, beep beep, Tylenol
Pulled up, one deep, no squad, just me
Just God, no prob’, real niggas tend to fuck wit' me
No jewelry, no stunt for me
Just a Bentley truck, and an empty cup of whatever that is
You too concerned 'bout how clever that is
Me, I'm concerned how much bread that it is
Or lettuce that it is
I been got my mama, I'll get off of this
I'm fucking the game, you niggas is lame
You won't even get a little head out of this
Bet I'ma miss, you niggas is dense, my hits goin' over the fence
How is you niggas so rich? I'm not so convinced, my wrist costin' more than your whip
And I don't wear that no more, that shit there look tacky
Yeah, I'm the G.O.A.T., no nigga, don't at me
Put on your coat, the world gon' get colder
This is my year, don't say I ain't told you, nigga

[Chorus: JID]
You don't give a damn, then we don't give a fuck
On God, I been waitin' for one of y'all pussy niggas to buck
Still starving, ribs touching
Touch the team and you get touched like homescreen buttons
Hoes scream loud, Jennifer Hudson when them thangs start bustin'

[Interlude: Vince Staples]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, ayy, ayy
Ayy, yo, uh-uh
Ayy, yo
Ayy, ain't this that, um...
Ayy, ain't this the Dreamville shit? This the, um...

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
I had a dream, I had a Glock, I had a beam, run it back
I had a dream, she in Celine, I'm in Supreme, run it back
Y'all had the dream, I had the guap, I hit the green, run it back
Ready to go, ready to score, ready for war, run it back
I'm finna bring the summer back
I'm finna bring the Hummer back
Snuck my gun in the function
I bust, he not coming back
Dummy racks, hundred stacks
Police killed 'bout a hundred blacks
Don't get killed tryna run a lap
Nigga don't get killed tryna run a...



[Melodic Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yo, yeah yeah, yo yo

[Verse 1 - Demonic Thug]
Yeah yeah, I know you love me, you created me, so you must be above me, uh
But I also want to be free, want to be me, feel trapped in a coma, please just let me be
You tell me that you mean the best, yet I feel compressed, I hate to be bitter but I'm a bit depressed
I love you but I hate you at the same time, feeling like everything I do is a crime

I know you want to prepare me, cause you care for me, but the future looks grim and it scares me
My friends very compelled, my actions swelled, I'm losing sleep then I wake up in this hell
I feel like a child, restricted to the point where it's beyond mild, yet the real world is gonna be wild, so please treat me like a human, my stress is adding up and it's about to be piled

[Hook - Demonic Thug]
I care for you so much that I'm fucking hurtin, I'm seeing through your eyes your vision perverted
You say you love me yet it feels like you hate me, hate that I'm an individual, and it hurts me
I know you created me, I'm under your grip, but I'm about tired of your bullshit
I really hope that we can repair this, repair this Restricted Relationship

[Verse 2 - Rapping Dito]
Yeah, you trying to control me, I know you own me, but I patrol me, that's just how it is
Spending money in the club shots of patron, I make my own decisions I am no longer a kid
I want to repair what we once had, please listen to dad, I'm tired of feeling like a fucking undergrad
I love you but I hate you at the same time, enjoying myself feels like a goddamn crime

I know you hate my friends, try to make ammends, yet you're so judgmental, and I really hopes it ends
They're not so bad, you give very little chances, I really hope you don't make anymore advances
I really feel like I've been living a lie, I still keep going I have no clue why
I really know you aren't perfect and neither am I
But please listen to my words whenever I cry

[Hook - Demonic Thug]
I care for you so much that I'm fucking hurtin, I'm seeing through your eyes your vision perverted
You say you love me yet it feels like you hate me, hate that I'm an individual, and it hurts me
I know you created me, I'm under your grip, but I'm about tired of your bullshit
I really hope that we can repair this, repair this Restricted Relationship

[Verse 3 - Spicy G]
Beyond every tunnel, there is always light, I don't want to fight, but I just want to make things right
You raised me, you made me, and I appreciate it, I just don't want to make you feel underappreciated
But you've done lots to prevent me, from reaching my potential, and that's where I draw the fucking line
I don't say this cause I hate you, it's the opposite, I just want to take this burden off my plate ooh

I hope you please just fucking listen to me. Is it too much to ask? Hopefully you agree
I imagine how it feels like to freely breathe, just to be free, envision yourself in me
Please put yourself in my place, would you really want this grim future to be your fate
So let's just leave this behind, I love but I fucking hate you at the same time

[Hook - Demonic Thug]
I care for you so much that I'm fucking hurtin, I'm seeing through your eyes your vision perverted
You say you love me yet it feels like you hate me, hate that I'm an individual, and it hurts me
I know you created me, I'm under your grip, but I'm about tired of your bullshit
I really hope that we can repair this, repair this Restricted Relationship



[Intro: Simba & Dad]
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here, and will rise upon you as the new king
And this will all be mine?
EVERYTHING
Everything the light touches

[Intro]
In my freshest J's, I ain’t slept in days
Girl, you gonna make me late undressing me
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”

Bitch, I’m the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch
Bitch, I’m the man of the year

[Verse]
What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blinding
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said “I gotta get my weight up”
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed with my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”
Being good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you’ll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it
18 and under, that’s prolly gonna take a minute
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years ’til I know 30
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo’
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starin’ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
With dessert to take, with dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime
Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds



[Verse 1]
Me and Disaster drawn together
I swear I need an eraser
I'm tryna chase the paper, I swear that shit is evasive
Stress has settled in, I'm tryna stick to my objectives
But stuck on anti-depressants
Escaping my adolescence...
And I'm screaming why me
Ain't no stickers on my stitchin, still niggas gon try me
If I ran I wonder if you niggas finna find me
My team is behind me
Or just me and Wiley...
I'm still runnin til I'm seein green
I'm a fiend of that fuckin Irene
By the time I get clean, I'mma be a fuckin great
Big ups if you with the team, and nigga fuck you if you ain't
Make no mistake nigga
I'm a boss of trades
Got my teeth grimy on the grind, we can floss for days
Real niggas listenin' strictly from recognition
Aw shit, you ain't a fan? You lookin' awful strange
I'mma be a king, that's something I had knew at birth
And now I'm tryna get some dollars 'fore the dollar lose it's worth
I might risk losin my mind, cause I ain't tryna lose the earth
We should be tryna make a change, we just tryna do shit first
Been here, but I'm back, crucified with heavy nails
10 year time lapse, Veggie Tales to reggie sales
Robbed for my bud out a transformers backpack
And now I'm in a wave of hella niggas bringin rap back
My pure determination, muhfuckas can't match that
The speed of my drive, muhfuckas can't catch that
Scratch that
Boy I'm in a new league of elitists
Black tees, jeans and some new Jeremy Scott Adidas
Slavin for my freedom, shit is so oxy moronic
Rather work for my goals then be workin at a Sonic's
Put this on a record bitch
And bleep out all the explitives
I thought I was in heaven, well
I guess it's all relative



[Intro]
Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out

[Hook]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

[Verse 2]
War stories, got tour stories
Pop-four-whores-on-the-top-floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick—that's my ex-bitch, homie—in fact, I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slammin' but her eggs get runny—funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow-up dolls, 'cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!

[Hook]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga



[Intro]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah, ayo, ah
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan; I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Outro]
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"



[Chorus]
Rise above, rise above
And you’ve got to
Rise above, rise above

[Verse 1]
She had a little daughter with her, it was cold out
She said “ah, I hate this motherfucker,” then she rolled out
He ain’t answering his phone, she yells “what the fuck?!”
Then told her daughter “buckle up, yeah, that’s for safety”
See she been stressin’ lately
‘Cause this nigga she done been with for the past two years
Is now the current reason for her last few tears
She text, he don’t text back
When she see him she be tryna sex, he don’t sex back
His heart be on jet black
She call, he don’t call back, all he say is “fall back”
A nigga just need his space, so she headed to his place
Cause she just got a call from her homegirl Rhonda
Who said he been creepin’, he been fuckin’ with Yolanda
“Yolanda? Yeah girl, Yolanda”
“Told you he ain’t shit but you ain’t listen, I was tryna” –
“Click” – hmmm, hung up that phone and hopped right up in that Honda
Headed to his crib, she said she fed up with this shit
“Thought this time this was the one, thought I got better at this shit”
“Pickin’ out Mr. Right, stick it out through the fights”
“And long nights, for what? These niggas is all alike”
She gon’ set it off, her daughter gon’ witness it all tonight, damn

[Chorus]
Rise above, rise above
And you’ve got to
Rise above, rise above

[Verse 2]
She said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition
Now she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference
Aye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they don’t listen
A ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?
I’m fuckin’ with you, but for real, she say they hopeless
A class full of jokesters, creating all the obstacles, impossible to focus
Little niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need
And they don’t even try, one little boy, he caught her eye
‘Cause he look just like her brother, she be havin’ to call his mother
But she act like she don’t care – what father? He ain’t here
Now she frustrated, thinkin’ that she just made the mistake of her life
Underpaid, be havin’ to waitress at night
Six years of college down the drain, drinkin’, tryna drown her pain
Party with her girls, feeling sorry for the world
‘Cause ain’t no hope for the youth, well ain’t that the truth
When all your role models either rappin’ or they hoop, damn

[Chorus]
Rise above, rise above
And you’ve got to
Rise above, rise above



[Intro: Jay-Z]
There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between eating the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot
I'mma find him though, I'mma sign him..
I don't want no problems

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
Took my time, crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine, Cole World
Same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't gotta mimic
'Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow, the niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars, it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets, nigga, I don't rhyme, I shoot, bang!

[Hook]
Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 2]
Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life taper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
I hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina, "Shut up, Cole!"
This is for my niggas back home, homes, what up, bo?
This is for the bitches that played me, what up, ho?
Nah I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
Is Cole still at it? Y'all be talkin' about the same shit
That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole's planning funerals, you might fit the coffin

[Hook]
Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 3]
Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
But if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna, hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no

[Outro]
If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take



(Chorus)
The good days are gone
I fucked up, I coulda been someone...
(Rivercity was us!)
I got nuthin but love for my crew
It's still my city, no matter where I move, and
Though the well done run dry
I fill my cup;
Cuz I'm still someone...
(Rivercity was us!)
I got nuthin but love for my crew
It's still my city, no matter what
Ohhh

(Verse 1)
I was nobody prior to rap
Pliable - liable to act prideful
When I was, in fact, trying to hide from
My past rivals
I lied to myself, 13: punk rock was my end-all
No genre compared; Barbie without a Ken doll
Dead Kennedys/Minor Threat/Ramones/Rancid
I loved the Misifts - but only with Glenn Danzig
Black Flag; and who could forget the Sex Pistols?
Subscribed to Hit Parader
Read every fresh issue
I never guessed what I'd least expect to get into
Would nest in me
Dressed to impress, and press into
My flesh and sinew...
Turns out, not all hip-hop's less than simple:
It can be complex and sinful
Let's continue...
June of '01, I met Colmes
And we became best bros, he showed me the light
Showed me the mic...
Showed me how to hone what I write
And transform my foreign form from my former device
Into more than a bored chorus
Four-score from the mic
From a spore that absorbs orbs for supportin' new life
And before this, I felt sure rap was a horrible type
Of abnormal recital, like a sort of porno you write
Like a form of informal advice
A portal to forewarn Mormons and all men alike
Of the force in the night...
Colmes schooled me on a few thangs
First lesson was "Wu-Tang"
Second lesson: "Learn the new slang"
"Ebonics" by Big L was a big help...
Third lesson was all culture;
The four elements
How to tell homies from vultures
He told me that real rappers are freestylers
So meanwhile, just practice for adversaries
Unwraveling capilleries
Adamant-actin', adapting to habitats is scary
And very combative, so stack up a mad vocabulary
He introduced me to Jarrod Thomas from Barker's Point
Back then, he was 'Klassick'
He asked if I wanna spark a joint
Years later, names changed and Monark had joined
Our crew; called ourselves "E-Sential"
The hardest boyz
Reppin' the North Side...
Sabotage on my tail
But Jarrod was barely involved in the songs that we spilled
Cuz he was also a member of "Ill Logic" as well;
At first, I came across as a novice with obvious help
I don't think he really thought a lot of me til
I recorded my song "Criminology", and, well...
I could tell he noticed a spark in me: Cracka can rhyme
That was at 16, big dreams, back of the line
Remember when we met Swollen Members and Project Wyze?
Tannery full of buses...fans fussin' in line
Moka tried to get us inside the Upper Deck
But we was underage, so we stayed on their bus, eatin chips
Prevail was real, but Mad Child was a dick
Moka Only was our homie, gave us Heineken sips
Jelleestone and the Rascalz...
Gettin' high with the gods
K-os was the bomb, and Kardinal Offishall...
Freestylin' with everything, tryna make an impression
So these celebrity legends always remembered Fredericton
I still got the photos...me dressed like I'm dead
I wanted Ecko that xmas: I got Exco instead
Writing words on the paper 'til nothing's left in my head...
New semester, attending FHS with no friends
It was here I met Kaleb; he took all the attention
Asking people "Where can I find a good, quality kitten?"
I just thought he was kiddin'
Later on, I witnessed him at the mall
Flittin' along, and his collar was twitchin':
It was a small little furball, squallin' relentless
He said "Nobody'd be bitchin if we ALL had a kitten..."
Yeah, I saw he was different: fairly gregarious
Spare me the alias of this Australian alien
Scared the episcopalian's failing the processors
Lepers with hot peppers
A leopard to spot-checkers
Hip-hop is chess, not checkers; poison every emcee
I bodied Casper live on '95.7 The Beat'
I was never this free; sparrin' mano-e-mano
Juliano the Godfather, Corrado Soprano
Fredericton was the scene
"Freddy Beach" was too shitty; we needed a
Name with a dream; someone said "Rivercity"
We was young, we was kingz...
So we started a crew
By '05, we was comprised of like 1-dozen dudes:
Nemesis, Juliano, Monark, Tubby D
Symphintry, KC...Great Dane RIP
TalkSick and Envy: Gorilla Militants
Skillfully spillin' millions of syllables full of sillyness
Heinous speech entertainers
J-names rolling deep, rolling dangerous;
Jeremy, Jody, Jarrod and Jason
Jeff, Justin, Josh, Joey, Jed and then Jacob
Just a justification for jumbled alliteration
It seemed that figures of speech were a way to our dreams...
Save the day and then fade away with a bag full'a weed
'Rivercity Kingz': what a great name for the team
Stake claims to break waves with our ways and our means
Fake life-wreckers; remember Late Nite Records?
Twenty4seveN brakelights make life hectic
In '05, I could repay the biscuits
Rap battles at the DJ Olympics
We played to win, then Phakt repayed the interest
I'ma decay these bitches; first victim, I iced
This rich kid with a mic, some lil' bitch named "White"
Seventeen and supreme
Makin' dreams out of reams
Churnin' cream in our teens
We freezed knees in capris
Medellin? Never been...
IED: smithereens -
Like Fedeyeen for Marines, Freddy's breezy for sheez
Now, my talent's surpassin':
Student schoolin his master
All on my own, anglophone /slash/ microphone grasper
That was back when we ate mushrooms in Jarrod's attic
And "I Gotcha Back" by Monark & Symph
Hadn't been scrapped yet
And they ain't scrapped yet;
Still best homies from knee-high
Til Joey and Jarrod's woman Toni boned, it was peacetime
There just never had been a time when
They never was friends
Now its 2017, and STILL: never again
Light a candle for Mikey...
Light a candle for Branscombe...
Leeferd jammin on his left-handed banjo at random
Tubby D and D-ZEL, out scramblin' fences
Ramblin, breakin' n enterin, scammin' n fencin'
Goddammit, when I said it, I meant it;
We was family, Rivercity calamity: damage relentless
"You Know Me" was '03
"Life Is War" was '04
"North Side" was '05...
...then a whole lotta more
Every Fredericton venue, I performed at em all
The Tannery, The Playhouse, Sweetwaters for sure
Wednesdays at The Cap; Nicky Zees, 20/20...
Leo Hayes at the Caf - stole every show like it's money
Student Union, from students at UNB and STU
To the truly stupid duffuses who used
To be me, now they're you
Terry Thomas/Apaustrophe is now called "NFP";
"Socially Exceptable" - that's him partnered with Ceeb
Rockin' apocalypse-causing, jaw-dropping releases
So fiber-optic only the top optometrists see them
The Elks Club: Bonshah be demolishing beats
Droppin bombs on the strong
Righting wrongs for the weak
Loc helped us record songs for our LP
But we abandoned it way before
We could master the bastard..
But we did a few shows...
(mostly I improvised; Red as drunk as a skunk
Me as high as the sky)
Free lines from the guys: E, coke, or whatever;
Sniff it, smoke it, I ain't jokin
I was hopeless as ever
Music dropped into second
Drugs hopped into 1st place
In the past decade, I might recall one or two birthdays
What the fuck can I say...
Best Days of my Life
But now they're gone, cuz I'm dead:
Bring me into the light

(Chorus)
The good days are gone
I fucked up, I coulda been someone...
(Rivercity was us!)
I got nuthin but love for my crew
It's still my city, no matter where I move, and
Though the well done run dry
I fill my cup;
Cuz I'm still someone...
(Rivercity was us!)
I got nuthin but love for my crew
It's still my city, no matter what
Ohhh



Just got off the phone with my nigga Smitty
Shit too real back home boi..
For real..

[J Cole]
This for my nigga Ced, hold ya head
I know shit rough, but nigga we don't give up
We don't get mad, nigga, we just get tough
We just get right, nigga, we don't get left
Fuck what they said, cause what we learned coming up
You can't teach that shit. Life deal a nigga blows
But we eat that shit
This one here's for my brother, we gon beat that shit now
I say my prayers, I got too many people in my head right now
So many that's in jail or they're dead right now
One time for my nigga Craig right now
He in the feds - damn, the times change
And these stupid niggas talking about "crime pays"
You can keep that shit: I just made a million
Call me when you reached that shit
Ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight
And the young boy from a show down in Hampton
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer
Ain't know what to say, I just froze
Little too deep, I suppose..
But after a year of review, I figured out it wasn't me, it was you nigga
Congratulations..



[Intro]
Yeah, this is the... warm up

[Verse 1]
Okay, I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up, had a hole up in my pocket, now it's sewed up
They feinin' for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it, better load up, I hang my coat up
Aye, I'm gon' be here for a while so I smile, haters
I'm on that green like a flower, like an alligator
Now or later, I'm serving niggas; I'm a sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how I cater, dog what you afraid of? Nothing
They talking gangsta without no data, they fronting
Jackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting
I wish a nigga would say something
I'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back
Piggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat
And I'mma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at
And I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques
Shoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Yea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick
They say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit
And I tote my horns. A star when I was born
My name ain't James, my word is bond
Yea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99
Damn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past
You're listening to the future
The flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool
I said I got a girl, she told me, "Me too! "
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it

[Break]

Yea and this is only "The Warm Up" yea



[Intro: Mike Epps (Sampled)]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they? You see 'em with their wife, "What's up Tony?" "Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright." You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?" "Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!"

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Verse 2]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?"
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit, like, "What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more"
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is whack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on



[Intro: Johnny Venus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
That nigga back from the dead, yeah
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Nigga almost lost his head, yeah
Gotta run, gotta fly, gotta float
Channels on top of the dresser
Baby, you down, need to bless up
Gotta watch how you address us
Playing no games, no dress-up
I got an idea
'Less you wildin' out in my hood, dawg ain't right here
Caption me as world nominated before I miss, yeah
Let the AK spray straight before I'm finished, yeah
As a monologue, talking to the fog, fuck a ho and miss, yeah

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
Cutthroat, rabbit's toe, I suppose
Maybe that's what life is

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Ayy, man, caveman
Two drink, cave in
Two blunt, ease up
Booyah, leaves up
Who care? Who there?
Do what? Wake up
The hell, happened
We want, hands up
Pay you, dare you
Motherfuck, motherfuck
Sister fucked, granny fucked
System, get some
Yeah, you, day two
Yeah, you, you, you
You a van, through the van
Stripper, good Lord
Top chi, not me
Boy, please, whatever
You next, to death
To go, ooh, oh
Who's that? Ring ring
Your number, bang bang
Callin' up, talk it up
Move over

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
Cutthroat, rabbit's toe, I suppose

[Verse 3: Smino]
Shit lookin' all red from the North with the pole
It ain't Santa Claus
Brought my gifts to Atlanta, I'm Atlanta Claus
I can smell you pussy with the panties off, I
Been gettin' to the bread, tryna keep this shit low
But it ain't workin', my
Circle on fire like a circus now
Around the same niggas I been around, so
Of course I (Of course I), endorse my (Endorse my)
Ratchet ass nigga from the North Side (North Side)
It's astigmatism, you got poor sight (Poor sight)
Let the bitches forget it, I do it Alzheim'
Of course I (Of course I), gotta voice my (Voice my)
Opinion on that ass when you walk past
(On bro, that shit groovy, ayy)
Niggas pull strings like a guitar, guitar
G-Star jeans on my sneakers
I'm a real soulful nigga, collard greens inside your speakers (Yeah, yeah)
Ferguson days on Castro, wasn't no cash flow
But I'm good for the arch, I'm Dr. Scholl's
I'm good for your heart, let me snatch your soul, soul, soul

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Bloody sacrifices

[Verse 4: Saba]
Yeah, ayy
Look at what a motherfucker do for the cash intake
They'll be right across your head like it's Ash Wednesday
You got to just get off your ass like your ass is fake
You can't sit, and if we ain't siblings, then I can't relate
To they shit, I'm Asic, I run shit, I got it jumpin' like pump fake
I don't need nothing but one take
I'm from the part of the city where young nigga keep him a nine like one plus eight
Our politician a fuckface
Corrupt like a Dogg Pound Gangsta
We duel like a small town wager
How I'm the dropout major
Success stories, I favor
Used to cover my scars, out here tryna cover The Fader
Yeah, Pro Tools, knobs, and the faders
Tell pigs as-salamu alaykum
You ain't 'bout static like AM radio, ain't even play him
I put my heart and my all in my art, I'm alternate
All of them are the same, it's harder to tell 'em apart some days
I thought I'd call 'em out altogether
Rather than waste the amount of bars it'll take for me to call 'em out by name
Caught a glimpse of the alternate world I've introduced to you
Via the studio, got 'em studying our mixtapes
I'm from the hood like my mama, put that on my mama
I lay the law down like parliament, all just with a pen and page

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
You can't be everything to everybody
I wanna be your lover, your best friend
Your Batman, Spider-Man
Fighter pilot shooting down your rivals and
I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up
I wanna be the one that feel you up
On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up
I wanna be the one to build you up
A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah
And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder
Pull you under
Toss my hopes out, Royal Rumble
We done moved out to the boondocks
Built a big house, there he wonders
How somewhere along the way
He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler
I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant
When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you
Say something crazy, they won't interject
Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you
Dangerous when it's nobody to check you
I be havin' to check myself
Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty
I be havin' to spread my wealth
I used to be at the crib myself
7 years old, off of Bragg Boulevard
Where they bag up the raw
They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls
And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws
Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up north on the path of a star
And I ran into you like I met you before
Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing

[Verse 6: J. Cole]
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day
I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay
She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day
She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay
She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way
She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay
I'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey

[Refrain: J. Cole]
And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to
And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices



[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better

[Bridge]
We should go and make a baby
You been patient, you deserve me on the daily
You ain't really with the beggin'
You know better than be talkin' to me crazy
We should go and make a baby
You been patient, you deserve me on the daily
You ain't really with the beggin'
You know better than be talkin' to me crazy

[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better

[Verse]
'Cause you know this, yeah you know this
I ain't one for being bogus
Got this weight up on my shoulders
Girl you treat me like a bogey
I've been stressed out, keep me stress free
You've been waitin' for me so long
Couple days I had to prolong, hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better

What the hell wrong with us?
Well known hustlers
Climbed up from the tailbone
Where the world don't want us
Plus your niggas be dumpin'

[Intro]
Yeah...
Take ya'll back... to them school days, yeah
Fayettenam, what up, man?

[Verse 1]
We came a long way from stick and move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape
All late to class with fake passes
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Dame Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak
It's all good, I'll probably have a new ex by next week
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that
But what I wouldn't give to go back

[Hook]
Yeah, back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish

[Verse 2]
Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh
Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low
Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flo'
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts
Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'
But some of my niggas will probably never make it
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor
Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up
Momma cut the light on, time to get up
Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out
At the time I thought this shit was so whack
But what I wouldn't give to go back
Yeah, hey

[Hook]
Yeah, back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish

[Verse 3]
I'm a little grown, but still reminisce
Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?
Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss
After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim
You forgot your school I.D? Fuck, nigga, you ain't gettin' in
In the hallways acting like some hoodlums
See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones
Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say
Twenty people on the phone cause everybody did three-way
Man we played them girls for the fools, but
Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools
Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick
She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn
Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone
I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone
Pardon me ya'll I'm just flipping through some Kodaks
Sitting, wishing I could go back

[Hook]
Yeah, back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish

[Outro]
Yeah, this shit is dedicated to all my niggas man
R.J., Mike Shaw, Jim Brown, yeah
B. Nasty, Big Joe, Smitty, what's good? Yeah
Terry Sanford High School, E. Smith
Class of 2003, that's me
I know y'all remember this



[Verse 1]
The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip
Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one
Ain't nobody else I’d rather be, not even Oprah’s son
Momma’s youngest gettin' paper like the oldest one
We livin' better, guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggas in hoopty
But we still bag hoes and them
These niggas give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we dovin' them
Ass fat so when pinch ‘em like a Doberman
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What’s your name
Where ya from
Ya got a dream
I’ll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey and don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got

[Refrain]
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
And don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

[Verse 2]
There’s so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I’m blessed nigga, I’m blessed
When I’m all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn ‘em into poems, they worship, I’m the best
And though I’m takin' long
They fuck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleepin'
I put you niggas to rest
The only one sayin' shit is like a nigga got tourettes
Unimpressed with you niggas
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey, dont stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it



[Sample]
This is Shaniya Davis, last seen wearing a blue sleep shirt and pink underwear. The search for the little girl is now entering its 11th hour in Fayetville, and there’s some disturbing new details

[Intro]
Yeah, hey
Fayettenam nigga
Dreamville nigga
J. Cole
Hey, ah
I ain't ready yet
Yeah, I ain't ready yet
Yeah, hey

[Verse 1]
Gettin' higher than the soul of little Shaniya
And to the ones that killed her, hope you burn in fire
I’m burnin' tires on the strip, tryna get a grip
Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip
6 shots of Hennessey, I’m still goin' strong
Please numb me from the bullshit that’s goin' on
That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered
And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of
You fuckin' coward, ain’t gotta tell em’ go to Hell
'Cause that’s the shit that make them other niggas sick in jail;
So you gon’ feel it
Travel the world reppin' this city, know I’m gon' kill it
But yet a nigga ain’t got a clue..
How I’m gon' deal with all the bullshit
Niggas sendin' shots my way
You put a hit out on me, think that I’m gon' stop? No way
Gon' have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin' so filthy
Young, black, and wealthy, nigga for that I’m guilty
Still see all the fake shit, it’s funny somehow
Thought the money could erase it, no matter how
Much dough you got you gotta face it, and to my niggas gone
Hope you in a better place, if I make it I’ll holla…

[Chorus]
See world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good

[Verse 2]
Uh, I got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget
The industry overlook me, for that I be holding grudges
Wouldn’t take a chance on me, suddenly it's, oh you love it
Let's get a Cole feature, that's gon' put you over budget, now
Picture being broke without no pot to piss in
And then suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like God to me, slowly losing my religion
As these notes from my composition turn to competitions, then
Put it out and hope the world sing
We sippin’ liquor for the pain that the world bring
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole
Just to find out that our heroes were some assholes, y’all don't hear me
Maybe I had the world figured out wrong
When these niggas go from singing our songs and waiting on you
'Bout a year later the same ones be hatin’ on you
Every other record these rappers be faking on you
Dog, we sing your songs but we know that ain’t you
We know you gotta make the people pay you
'Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you
And be that broke muthafucker talkin' 'bout “I stayed true”

[Chorus]
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good

[Sample]
By candlelight, they stood as one, numb with shock and disbelief. A little girl's body, found Monday, is believed to be five-year-old Shaniya Davis, missing since last Tuesday. Davis has been charged with the unthinkable; prostituting her five year old daughter. Security camera’s spotted a man carrying Shaniya into a hotel last Tuesday. This man, police said, is now charged with Shaniya’s kidnapping. Search parties found the girl’s body yesterday a 100 feet off-road, wearing only a t-shirt

[Chorus]
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good



[Verse 1]
Whoever thought a Carolina nigga would've been the greatest
We strong cause the hard times made us into men
Hold up I gotta say that shit again
I said the hard times made us into men
See a man gonna stand with the world as a weight
But the boy gonna break, only so much he could take
See I traveled outta state and I ain't know a soul
Told my momma I'd be back when I had a million sold
Million flows million stories I done told
Shed tears when they cut me from the team couldn't wait till next year
Then I told the best player look
"Though I ain't as tall as y'all niggas
Next year I'mma be better then all ya'll niggas"
Ay this is for the Ville shout to all ya'll niggas
I pray you never pass like them ballhog niggas
And at all cost nigga I'mma shine
They gon' remember my name like it's tatted on they mind
J. Cole J. Cole
Ay, fresher than a day old newborn, bitches blowing kisses
That's the same ho that you on
I knew her back in high-school, but heard she failed college
She blew me like she blew her nail polish
That's knowledge if I ever seen it
Say I'mma call her, but don't ever mean it
See I'm preoccupied, watch how my stock arise
She want the time and that's just something I cannot provide
Cause time is money and I, I ain't no dummy and I
I'm trying get paid, man I gotta stay brave Atlanta
I let your misses sip me, I ain't talking David Banner, ain't a planner
So if it's random then it's naturally
Name a motherfucker out here matching me

[Outro]
Nigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good
Nigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good
Nigga I'm feeling good



[Intro: Ari Lennox]
Ooh
Hold it, need it, need it, yeah
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow

[Verse 1: Ari Lennox]
Touch me, take me, kiss me
Love me, impress me
Pull up, black truck, ganja
Wrist so blinding, heart so timeless
Wishing, you could meet me, see me, freak me

[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
You lost in the shape of my hips
Hope there is a move
If you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hope there is a move (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can

[Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You crossed my mind a thousand times
The cost was fine, I draw the line
I'm back, relapse, I'm fiending
Yes, what's that? In fact, I'm dreaming
Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
I got a shot at you, you wouldn't reach
Cop that, cock back, trigger release
Pop that top, take a sip of your holiest water
I know I'm a part of your flow now
Tell me you cut her
Don't matter you love her or not, you got part of her soul now
I ain't know then, but I know now
Apologies due, to one of the few
The ones I ran through, but never loved you
I pray you found peace and you whole now
I'm doin' better, I got me a chocolate bar
Climbin' on top of the bar
Think of the shape, and I lick in the places you only gon' lick when you rock with her forever

[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
You lost in the shape of my hips
Hope there is a move
And if you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hope there is a move (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love

[Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)
Shea Butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)



[Intro: J. Cole & Amber Coffman (Sampled)]
She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I’ve never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I’m gonna run run away (oh I), run run away, run away (oh I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (well all right)
Run run away, run run away (oh I), run away (oh I-I-I)
Show ‘em that your color is black (well all right)

[Verse 1]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch in his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can’t be what you want from me, well all right

[Verse 2]
Damned if I do (shit)
Damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can’t be what you want from me, well all right

[Bridge 1]
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)

[Bridge 2]
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie

[Refrain]

[Intro]
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time



[Intro]
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

[Bridge]
For you I drop the tough guy shit, on this bus I sit
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you

[Verse 1]
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

[Bridge]
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift? (Am I strong enough to lift?)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)

[Verse 2]
Ib gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit, hey mama look what God made
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

[Outro]
There is a God, it is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Life make a nigga wanna yell out
Change for that fame, how some niggas turn sell out
Too old for my mama crib, I'm tryin to get the hell out
Stayin' out these cells but we working on that bailout
Help out, please. Sure is hard livin without cheese
Ain't shit in my pocket only these house keys
They pray for a nigga but yet they doubt me
That's why I'm out getting higher than balconies
But no I won't jump, being broke is childish and boy I'm grown up
My money runnin' late tho so boy I won't front
When my paper finally make you should know I'm gonna stunt
So, hard

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My God, my life is such turmoil
Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me don't let my guard down
I gotta get it my nigga

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Never believe what they say
Man, I gotta get paid
Dawg it's so damn amazing
How I'mma shock the World
I'mma shock the World
Hell naw I ain't lying
Yea, I gotta get mine
Dawg it’s about time
So I'mma shock the world
So I'mma shock the world

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar, system hopin' I soak up
Enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was closer to my dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said you owe us
Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and then a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
And you could see it even when I'm Sleep
My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson
Or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin' on his grind
This the life of a Compton nigga
I know the vanities of the world like the promise niggas
That's why we crooked, in yo bushes where you find us nigga
You better scramble before you fold like an omelet nigga
This ain't insomnic nigga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me
So when I catch a fade they know to put more than one on me
Fear no evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up
Niggas tuck like a baby in fetal, position
If you listen you can hear the city needs you
That's what my mind said
But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a black Beatle
Until my number is called and someone yell bingo
A shadow in the dark, park the coupe
Then recoup with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar



[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, look how I came up
Yeah, ayy, look how I came up, nigga
Ayy, look

[Verse]
Momma I came up
Cold as hell in New York but I flame up
Straight up out that dirty type of shit you cannot clean up
A dollar and a dream the only things I had to bring up
Now any nigga out there gunning for me gotta aim up
Say what, niggas ask me what the Ville be like
Just tell em that it's real, hoping that they me feel me, right
I'm so bright I close my eyes and I can still see light
I'm so live you motherfuckers gotta kill me twice
Man, I promise I'm murdering classics, paying my homage
The fifteenth of the month and I'm just now paying Mohammed
Said the rent's due on the first, but he don't know the shit
I been through and it hurts, can't wait to blow
Yeah, I think about heaven sometimes, can't wait to go
If it's real will I even get in, I ain't fo' sure
'Cause I've been sinning
Getting bent it's been a minute since I been
Up in a church
Only time is when my friend up in a hearse
Lord, I'm praying for me my Momma
I just went up in her purse
Not to steal
All I saw was some bills and not a dollar
In sight
It’s time she lived a more desirable life
I'm chasing money
And dreams only God got the means to take em from me
I scheme while I'm riding through Queens
I ain't no dummy
A Fayettenam repper 'til the day that I'm gone
Nigga get your weight up all the way up if you hating on me
Cause boy I might pray but ain't no preying on me
I'm hot like Satan just laying on me
So when you get to hell you can say you know me
I said I might pray but ain't no preying on me
So when you get to hell, you can say you know me

But lord please protect my family cause if they graze
Niggas is loading up that ammi and them A-K's

And so I'm asking you if you can hold me down lord
Be my umbrella-ella-ella in this downpour
I know you never ever ever let me drown or
Won't let that devil ever ever win this round naw
And though I stray for you, you know that my heart is good

Niggas congratulate me I just tell them God is good
God is good

[Hook]

Okay I told motherfuckers I was sicker than rickets
Quick rising up like I'm blood that's iron deficient
Imma get off, spit hot until I'm blue in theface
So when I get off stage I don't have to listen to crickets

I switch flows with a flick of the wrist
Talking in two directions call it lickety-split
Y'all sound unsound that's some rickety spit
My sound make crowd pound ground when they listen

Man it sound like a battle cry from the back to the front
I'm passing a blunt they don't bat an eye 'cause I'm classic as fuck
Got a bag and a cup never satisfied, never passing the buck
I'm stacking 'em up on a salary I'm a samurai in the cut

I don't kill nothing, always suicide or sepukku
Nobody wants the hands so they'll probably decide to voodoo
Nobody understands in the circumstance what would you do
No need to answer, just know people counting on me like Duku

It's episodic I'm snapping my neck like I'm epileptic
I step inside of my mind and eject an entire lexicon
I ain't flexing Im flaccid and still impressing 'em passive
Y'all pressing pills in the passenger seat to push at the festival

Rest of 'em rest in peace, drop a bomb on abomination
JAGA uncommon the combination, why he so raw and so patient?
I got a dream in the lowest common denomination on paper
I'm like cocaine traces on my proliferation

I put the wreck in recreation
Man I'm the manifestation of requiem for a dreamer
That's stuck in the stands of the stadium
Made it a plan to slay 'em like ritual lambs
In the hands of the able and willing

I'm Cain to Abel, I'm capable, stable, still and I'm killing 'em
In the valley of shadows we battle to shine brilliant
Fabled I'm rarer than one in a million squared
This feeling's so unfamiliar never been so prepared

It's really unfair, I'm kind of embarrassed, my cheeks cherry
You cannot compare, cause I'm leaving here in a chariot
They take your body and bury it, say it was you
Now the candlelight feels nefarious, smoke is filling the air

'Cause I'm burning an effigy of my enemies while I sleepwalk
It's every night I'm just probably gon' turn the heat off
We move in silence like under my feet was peat moss
Keeping the tension high 'til you break the edge of your seat off

'Til you
'Til you break the edge of your seat off
JAGA
Jump

Okay I told motherfuckers I was sicker than sickle cell
Rain trickle and fell down the window pane of my cell
I'm a prisoner of my mind
I been doing time and breaking bricks
Hammer fist
And I kinda like it call me masochist

Never flexing machismo
Rather show you what it is or what it isn't
I ain't pissing my time away airing out business
I couldn't care less what you're getting into
I'm just breaking new ground, Earth is splitting in two

Let the fissure open up, force of nuclear fission
They wanna know the vision, the mission, the move
Like gimme a pot to piss in or imma piss in your kitchen
Maybe I'm fucked up, but not as fucked as your food

I'm sick
No two ways to skin it
SIck
Probably how the news gonna spin it
Sick
Ya know it's kinda funny innit?
The healthiest flow coming from the sickest
So grab a shovel you dig it

Like six feet, by 77 inches
And six deep
I formulated a dream at 16
I fucked off and did things, a mixed bag
But fuck that I'm
Back and ready to get it

Like half a dozen or six, it dont matter which way you split it
It really don't make a difference
Man you don't want what I'm spitting I'm sick
Making shit crawl under skin then I'm sick
Like your favorite "hold me when you're scared" type flick
But I don't know a one who can compare like shit
So lemme put a blunt up in the air right quick
Like a nickname might stick, I'll be household
Big things coming 'fore my story outro hit

Cause I'm sick
JAGA sick
JAGA (JAGA)
JAGA sick
(JAGA JAGA JAGA)
JAGA!

Okay
Okay I told motherfuckers I was sicker than rickets
Quick rising up like I'm blood that's iron deficient
Imma get off, spit hot until I'm blue in theface
So when I get off stage I don't have to listen to shit, man



[Verse 1]
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short—fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains—Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer—hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World—it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now—couldn't be more here-er
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 2]
Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', "how did he manage?"
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?!"
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 3]
I made it to the rock, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start
My life’s like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Intro]
But uh, yeah, man, I mean
Basically, I'm just, tired of all this shit and what-not
I’m 'bout to give you shit from my perspective
Shit how I feel through a, the daily basis
And um, shit I wouldn't want up changing, in general
Shit that I feel people should know
I mean, I ain’t get this microphone for no reason, my nigga
You know
I'ma just explain to you some shit, whatever (I mean)
If you feel like you in the sideline then, this song's for you, basically
Ha, and shit, but uh, hear me out

[Verse 1]
Huh, fuck it
My flow is lyrically homicide, to get the case
A smile on my face as I get to the nine to five
I get this rap shit on my life
Fuck yo' favorite rapper
Give me the mic' and dim the lights
I'll explain my story, show my rise to glory
Shit, I'm still on that road
Just to let you know, I tried to blow like Hiroshima
Get it cleaner up on my screen-er
Walkin' like a mobster, eatin’ lobsters
Quite a shock to the fantasy
I show no love to reality as I gradually
Grab the Presidents from the resurrection
Came up wit’ two suggestions
It's do whatever to make the cheddar
For the worse or for the better
As I long as I don’t sell my soul
I'll try to make this cash forever
However, niggas try to break yo' fall
I mean, yeah, you got rhymes
But trust me, that ain't it at all
They try to crack yo’ jaw wit' that [?]-it shit
What is this serious lyrical business they witness?
So, they tend not to sleep
Do whatever to get you bread and make yourself eat

[Break 1]
Look, I said um
I said it like this
Ha!

[Chorus]
See, I'ma put myself on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
See a lil' nigga put the bank on me
Cause I could bet you anytime, it won't be free
See, these niggas really wanna sleep on me
Oh, Lord
I wonder why I would't be so sure
But, I wish somebody had a guideline
On how to get up out the sideline
(Side-line, sideline, yeah
I said, ha, sideline
Where ever we go, sideline
Yeah, sideline nigga)

[Verse 2]
Look, throughout the pain
Sufferin' and the rain
I stayed the same learnin' the game of life
Only you can get cut off at any given sight
Maybe, I might become so tight wit' the mic'
Kickin' knowledge, while bumpin' The Chronic
I find it ironic
On how the theories of the world get through people
Knowin' they put fear in yo' heart just to make you evil
Please don't fall for the traps
Perhaps we can look at it from a slower perspective
And when it gets hectic, look for yo' savior
And no one's prayed for the wicked
I get lifted, I feel like I have the courage yet
They consider me gifted
I try to reach in yo' heart to spark a rage
But in a good way, we need change
Shit ain't the same
Why don't people care at all?
The Government is fuckin' us up
While in the court they ball
Killuminati rollin' through yo' body like a 12 gauge shotty
Oh, I see, I respect none of these fake niggas
Who would figure yo' idol won't admit that you're in danger?
Them riches turn bitches inside strangers
Ha, how can I live now?
When I never cried later
I say fuck the others who gon' become haters
15 year-old rebel, I write 'til I die, wit' my pride in my hand
Understand as a man, I tried to do the best as I can
But only you can control yourself
So what will it be?
Are you down for life, or just for fake wealth?
Pain equals passion, passion equals pain
Yeah, I tried to lend an open hand but niggas don't act the same

[Break 2]
And, yeah, but, alright
Look, I said um
Ha, look

[Verse 3]
You would figure life can never get any better
For standin' under the bad weather, wit' a sad song
You actin' wrong 'bout all the bullshit they say
Man, I'm tryin' to negotiate wit' deaths on my casket
That shit can get put on delay
Never gave a fuck about a bitch, but I sure love a ho
Bust a nut and then she goes
Pass the cup and now we movin' slow
Walkin' high up on my toes
Livin' life carefree, shit, nigga, I don't know
I express my emotions through the drugs
And fuck for the love of the sweet sex
Never being cautious, so I never use a Latex
But in any words, I touch myself to old V.H.S. porn
Brainstorm about the future, fuck the past
Roll the blunt and get the grass
See my eyes go to white and to an instant red flash
What the fuck I got to live for?
This song is for all the girls who's been called a whore
A song for all the niggas who didn't have the balls
To talk to that fine bitch next door
I always wanted to be that popular kid
Instead, I'm that kid wonderin' where my real Pops is
It's like the older I get, the more I regret
Puttin' my feelin's into women
I should've thought about all the pussies that I could be swimmin' in
See, sex isn't good until you're high as fuck
Sloppy drunk up on the pavement
Screamin', "What the? Fuck it!"
When I talk about my Step-Dad
I swear to God, I understand my Mom's pain
'Cause bitches play the same game
You can't forget about the popular kids
The ones wit' the Cement 3's
Nike S.B.'s, Gucci backpacks, Louis, Versace
Always the type of person to wish that I was exactly like them
Too bad, when they heard my name
They said "What the fuck? I don't like him."
For only if they knew the real me
See, being our normal to the world isn't cool
And they wonder why I say, "Fuck school! That shit's a hell-hole."
Want to put me back on my ex, "Oh, hell no!"
I feel like I'm in hell though
See, everyone knows Isaiah
But they don't know Izzy wit' his evil thoughts and his smart remarks

[Outro]
Yeah



[Intro: Fifth Business]

[Verse 1: Fifth Business]

I just want to get it right, and live life in a nice crib
With white skinned girls walking right in, I might man
But until then I hope my mind stay bright
Cause I like to keep the lights dim with a girl in my right hand
I know we taking off this the flight plan
My girl ain't talking back I heard she looking for the right man
Hah, so this what I'm saying
You told me you was faithful but that's not what other guys claim
But I was wrong to dwell in my pain cause obviously
I'm the one who wronged you when the time came
And I'm sorry for repeating myself
Opportunities preceeded the need for feeding my self
I was couch surfing, street sleeping, bullshit I was knee deep in
Always had them kicks to throw my motherfuckin' feet in
Meaning, that's just another reason
For y'all to duck when I'm leaping, giving daps then I'm peacing
My demeanour's never leaving not even for a weekend or a holiday
I've just been working for a solid pay
Trynna get these dollars raised before I start my scholar phase
Where all my people holler Jay and it's safe to ball away
But hey, I ain't coming home yet, man
I still got the summer, sun is never go'n set, hey
I called my man up like who you running from yet
Man my city is greedy but it can stomach your debts
Cause from here? You can rise or you can plummet instead
I was homeless so it led to me just fuckin' for beds
But I guess in retrospect I was stuck in a sense
Cause all I wanted was love but I was loving the sex
Then regrets would follow, followed by blatant disrespect
Cause I was hatin' my decisions like incisions to the neck
Just, fishing for a cheque, wishing I was set
But after a year of misery imprisonment was next
Then I was, bailed out and shipped off to rehab
And it was seemingly eating at my disease that was
Slowly killing my soul my old life wasn't appealing no more
Still the feelings are drawn but Jordan stayed and Tanner is gone
Bitch!



[Verse]
Straight out The Ville and I made it
Like a villain I'm hated
I see 'em grillin', I ate it though
Finna blow inflatable, that's undebatable, uh
I'm givin' niggas food for thought, the flow is catered, yo
I'm never faded though
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the dough related, ho
It's like my only son, where I go, he come
Niggas dumb to be braggin' bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin' like the light-skin version
Of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised
That's word to everything
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin'
You sucka niggas lie in everything that ya sayin'
Shame on y;all, you tryna ball with the game on pause
A nigga pull the thing on y'all, y'all stain y'all draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on y'all
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale, I excel in this rap shit
Cause y'all spittin' that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin' bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats that made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin' for the freaks and the dimes
And I shine like a mothafuckin' diamond
You shine like a mothafuckin' dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin' on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin' hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate
I grew up with nothin', it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huxtable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzle for
Look how the buzz will grow
Ballin' 'til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin' funny, fuck a joke
I'm gettin' money til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga: young simba



[Verse 1: J.I.D]
My girl booty soft and it's shaped like a skrawberry
Her pussy bald with a tat like Stephon Marbury
Carry all my dirt to the grave, I'm the pallbearer
Bury all of my sins, staring out of the Benz
Gone off weed, gone off Hen', gone with the wind
Gone with the pretty long hair is with the fairest skin
Yelling in her face, and she repeat like a parrot and
Apparently she gone keep yelling at me, I'ma never win
Where your ass was at when I was sleeping on the couch
And in the whip?
Probably with another nigga, on another nigga dick
I'm on another tip, my skin so tint, strength on strength
One on ten against me, I won't break, I don't bend
Watch your statements, guard your chin
Guard your heart, guard your light
Find your zen, mind your lightness
You doing without cause you ain’t looking within
But if you ever in doubt give this a spin

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Check, look, cool
I mean shawty had relations that we never could speak about
You get mad, I'm mad, we sleep it out
And then she had a man who used to beat her
So she told me she wanted out
Got a couple abortions, now that pussy's a haunted house
Now her heart cold, Antartica, Siberia
Had it planned out, curriculum, criteria
Change, she feel pain, strain, built up anger
From dealing with a dickhead, putting her life in danger
I understand, it's times that you go through your women things
And sometimes can't gauge clearly on what you be thinking
I swear I got your back and got the tab on what you drinking
You ain't gotta move a finger or pinky when we linking
Whatever keeps your boat afloat or ship sinking
From loose lips of side women stepping out of position
Breaking out of a system, prison
Parallelogram, shaping the prism, stop signs never stopped I
Let's be realistic, I been trying to get in touch with my senses
And be better to my sisters
But niggas think that you feminine when you sensitive
My home girl rap, and she feminist
Hold it down for the women, I call her "Feminem"
Tell 'em how you really feel headass
Cause ass shots are dead ass and fake tits been around, we gas it
Girl you perfect without that make up or the plastic surgery
I'ma tell you how it is like Ron Burgundy

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down



[Verse 1]
I got dreams of gleaming wings and Beamers
Cream so obscene
Ain't gotta clean my sneakers no mo'
A closet full of Polo
A pocket full of mo' dough
I'm knocking in the fo' door
Never stopping for the popo
I can't forget to send my momma to the Acapulco
You laugh what, can't a nigga dream big
A swimming pool, big screen, mint-green Benz
Me and Christina Milian with sixteen kids
Yeah, I joke but a nigga mean biz'
Lemme tell you how it is, nigga
I got this feeling man, a nigga finna hit the ceiling fan
Fayettevillain killing, fishing for that scrilla, reelin' in
I'm leaning
That mean I'm chilling
I'm feeling like Gilligan
Nigga what is this a barbecue?
So why the fuck you grilling then

[Verse 2]
If I'm back in the 'Ville, haters smack in they grills
Ladies like 'em; got that '80s Michael Jackson appeal
Homie curiosity, all these cats getting killed
Niggas caps gettin' peeled, for that cash niggas
Will run up on yo' ass in that mask flash and the steel
Niggas laugh when they steal
I just brag cause I'm real
Motherfucker I'm the shit
I pass gas when I feel
Shit is trash bag, it's all about the last laugh
Mad I got yo' girl turned over like a bad pass
She know I rap, so I ain't even have to bag that
Cash that? Probably not how I design rhymes
The dick got 'em singin'
I could get yo' dime signed
A Don Juan type armed with a strong pipe
I even put it on dykes
I'm smashing like it's Prom Night, bitch

[Verse 3]
You niggas must've got your marijuana laced
I know some magicians make you disappear without a trace
Out-of-state speedin' through New York with Carolina plates
I'm the God mother fucker, and how dare y'all try to hate
You'll never shine like me, you could wear your hottest Bapes
I'ma show y'all how to cake
I can tell your Prada's fake
I understand you think fly
But nigga you ain't got a cape
I understand you think you gangsta
Nigga you ain't shot a thing
Them niggas bring it to you point-blank range, ain't gotta aim
Yeah, you see some players shooting, but this shit is not a game
Badda boom, badda bang
Lot of goons, lot of lames
Old groupie-ass niggas like the clan
Tryna hang, yeah
By the way, since ninety-seven I been nice
I'm finna get it crackin' like fat niggas on thin ice, wooh



[Intro]
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began

[Verse 1]
Yeah, no Zack and Kelly but tell me and to The Max we go
And treat these verses like Margarito and Pacquiao
Teachers thought I’d never come out my shell and well
Now I hop on beats and go pistachio
They’ll never steal my dreams like Leo DiCaprio
So before the madness grow, I speak what they have to know
In a town that was small, I crashed in the lawn
The effect that I met was like a splash in the pond
See I, rap for my mom in the back of the car she said
Boy, you crazy, Momma’s little baby
I always told her I would drop a project one day
Now I’m takin' off, my project's on the runway
From suburbs of young nerds to projects that see gun play
To models on the runway, it’ll reach ‘em all in some way
They hit my brother with ten years, he said don’t leave
I said, there’s no weave baby brother I’ve been here

[Refrain]
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
So this is my beginning
I look to the sky, with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky, is the limit
But I don’t know why, and when I finally fly
I'm gonna show em all, this is my beginning
I look to the sky with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky is the limit
But I don’t know why, but I don’t know why

[Verse 2]
July baby but cooler than an October boy
With more lines than a zebra wearin' corduroys
On my high horse, I should go to Troy
Set my flight course, as my wings deploy
Postcards and Polaroids
But not enough time to buy a stamp and show my boys
In Japan eatin' fish that's coy with little soy
Then I’m off to London watchin' this bridge that we built destroy
Don’t take advantage of the simple joys
My Ma text all the time but I miss her voice
And I know you wish you caught me before I flew off
But I was runnin' red lights like Rudolph
Just so I can zoom off, like takin' Nike shoes off
Hit the stage that I grace to amuse y’all
Wanna be a pilot, you gotta learn to fly
And you wanna be a star, your home in the sky
That's why

[Refrain]
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
So this is my beginning
I look to the sky, with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky, is the limit
But I don’t know why, and when I finally fly
I'm gonna show em all, this is my beginning
I look to the sky with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky is the limit
But I don’t know why, but I don’t know why

[Verse 3]
Look, my RCA blast and some jewels that I cut like Cartier
Soon as I stepped outta the chamber like the RZA
Bobbin' to my Digital shit
Plan to lash at all the haters with this physical whip
My lyrics flow like, how much more can lyrical get
When all I try to do is put they soul on spiritual lift
The pastor tell it, I’m abusin' my miracle gift
When I just do like him and use it just to get me some chips
So if the rappin' this male do, just happen to help you
And fell through the cracks, and it happen to fit
Watch it connect your soul, my hustle like Russell
I just hope my grind connects with the globe
And then bring some more label reps to my home
Then I can pass the cake to the next nigga on
Fly maneuvers, Metropolis is on
I say bye to, but I will never be gone

[Refrain]
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
So this is my beginning
I look to the sky, with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky, is the limit
But I don’t know why, and when I finally fly
I'm gonna show em all, this is my beginning
I look to the sky with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky is the limit
But I don’t know why, but I don’t know why



[Intro: J. Cole and Rihanna]
I like it, like it
I like it, like it
I like it, like it
I, I like it, like it
I like it, like it
I like it, like it
I like it, like it
Na na na come on (I like it, like it)
Na na na, come on (I, I like it, like it)
Na na na na come on (I like it, like it)
Na na na, come on, come on, come on
Na na na na na

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
'Cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling, leaves me wanting more

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Hook: Rihanna and J. Cole]
Na na na, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn it up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped?
Do you like rough sex? Hit 'em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet?
Le-le-let's go, you rockin' with Cole, it's the best flow
Put the game on lock while those lame-os watch
I'm on fire, they are not, I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch, I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you gone bad, you only got badder
Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me
Just one night full of sin
Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your time to hurt me yeah
If I'm bad tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
'Cause the pain is my pleasure, nothing comes better
Yeah

[Chorus: J. Cole]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Hook: Rihanna and J. Cole]
Na na na, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what, I've been yearning for give it to me strong

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah
I like it, like it

[Chorus: J.Cole]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Chorus: Rihanna and J. Cole]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Intro: J. Cole]
Aba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current
Is fightin' against me and I'm so tired, I'm floatin' now
Oh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power
Of learnin' to let go, and just let God
Enjoy the ride

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, look
Born into pain, alcoholic veins
Over-analytical brain a product of the shame
And runnin' from a past, that's checkered like the game
Somewhere 'long the way somebody snatched my peace and main
Maybe that's the reason I spent decades seekin' fame
And fortune hopin' that a proper portion would contain
The sadness in my eyes, remember when I came
In this music business, all their questions was insane
"Why you never smile in your pictures?" I refrain
From givin' you the answer 'cause that answer wasn't plain
Enough for me to see 'cause at the time I knew my name
But didn't know myself, and so I dealt with shit the same
As a fugitive, but running from the truth and shit
I shoot the shit with niggas, but they never knew the shit that's hidden deep
Within the crevices like ever since I was a child
Seen my mama with the pistol pointed at her dome and how
In the fuck do you expect for me to ever be the best lil' me
That I can be, when trauma's deep inside of me, like I.V. fluid Pumpin' through the blood of wifey, while she's givin' birth
To my child, I know my thoughts are runnin' wild
Bear with my style, this just a trial run
Just heard these kids don't know 'bout Malcolm
And I'm sort of heartbroken 'cause the elders lost hope in our youth
And here I sit dead in the middle, not a little boy no more
But not quite old yet, wakin' up in cold sweats
Scared that I'm too disconnected from the kids' perspective
The world ain't got no patience for some shit that's introspective So where in the fuck that leave me? Irrelevant, I guess
Went from Heaven-sent to hella bent, intelligent but stressed, damn

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current
Is fightin' against me and I'm so tired, I'm floatin' now
Oh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power
Of learnin' to let go, and just let God
Enjoy the ride

[Bridge: Rapsody]
One more time
Swim good, enjoy the ride (Yeah)
Every day I rise, thank God that I am alive (Yeah)
Yeah, swim good, enjoy the ride (Yeah)
Every day I rise, thank God that I am alive (Uh)

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Permanent vacation for forever
Some things you gotta leave behind, some people just like weather
And seasons, for that reason, I know I'll always have a leg up
Weatherman forecast me dead last, think I'm just another nigga
Maybe, I'll be the next Black Beatle like Swae Lee
Yeah, I know my worth, these colonizers got to pay me
Yeah, I had to go first 'cause the rest would never last
I had to show the positives for those that couldn't add
Lookin' at the ads, they only love us if our ass
Out and so I'm out, I got an Audi and it's bad
I said that line 'cause niggas only respect you if you brag
It don't work on me the same, don't give a fuck 'bout what you have
Everybody claimin' boss, none of you niggas got no staff
It don't measure up the same, what's a quarter to a half?
Of a whole lot of problems, nigga, who taught you to add?
Where I'm from, we don't recognize that it's good math
If you don't teach the ones that's comin' up to multiply their cash
Think for themselves, think beyond sales
Everything with worth don't come with some whistles and some bells
The ones I gotta leave behind, the ones you gotta bail
Meek Mill, I'm workin' hard, ain't too far from a meek mil'
To keep it real, the realest niggas I know always kept it real
And I'ma tell you, Black-on-Black murder been whack
9th, turn me up so they can hear me in the back
Yeah, and that's pretty hard for me
But you see hopeful niggas and where they all ought to be
Scared to grow wings, Birdman with a bunch of Carter beef
That's old news, look, nigga, you talkin' to modern me
Smarter, we had better conversations sittin' with barbers
Puttin' hearts and heads in niggas who don't think ahead, who taught you?
School y'all, school y'all, welcome to the schoolyard
Teach you how to make moves without needin' a UHAUL
I was on you all when I was growin' up
Now it's you all that's all on these nuts
I'm ballin', havin' a ball and I got the balls to say it
Who needs inspiration where you know when you can play it?
Carolina to the heart, nobody here gon' play us
The day that we expire, Carolina's where they'll lay us
I woke up feelin' like Aaliyah, yeah, a million and one bucks
Told these niggas I don't give a single million and one fuck, Rap

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current
Is fightin' against me and I'm so tired, I'm floatin' now
Oh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power
Of learnin' to let go, and just let God
Enjoy the ride



[Verse 1]
Aye baby tell me have you ever seen a nigga chasin' dreams
Leavin' everything he love behind to make this cream
Kisses his momma on the cheek, say, don't worry I'll be back
I gotta get you out this shit, I'm a hurry, I'll speed back
You see, that's the type of shit the boy be thinkin' when he dreamin'
And he don't pay no mind to them niggas that's disagreein'
Sayin', nigga, is you crazy
Them same ones that's talkin' be the same ones not doin' shit
Aye, nigga is you lazy
Or is you scared to follow dreams
I know you gotta have one
The opportunities be in yo' face
You gotta grab one nigga
But while you're bullshittin'
I'll be woodgrippin' gettin' wealthy
On the road to riches, God help me
I'll holla at ya'll niggas when I see you, wouldn't wanna be you
Cause you fear what I don't, see this here is what I want
So I'm a get it poppin', I'm rockin' despite the obstacles
Look, my nigga what you call impossible is possible

[Refrain]
Aye, tell my niggas to keep they heads up
We made it too damn far just to give it up
And we way too strong
This is a song for the Ville
Yeah, yeah
And baby don't cry, you know I'm comin' back
I did it for the city, gotta get up on the map
And I know we gon' shine
This is a song for the Ville, yeah

[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressin', I know it's temporary
Starin' at my granny obituary
She almost made it to eighty before they buried
Damn, can't even tell you I'm sure I'll to make it to 30
Cause you never know, sometimes life takes a turn for the worst
Is you holdin' on to will, or did you let it go
Heaven knows I'm tryna hold on
So every night I pray and hope my life is prolonged
The journey seemed so long but hold up
Don't take me up
I got big dreams nigga, ya'll can't wake me up
Life's a bitch but death don't break me up, I got too much to live for
It seems too many niggas die with way too much potential
Gotta get up out this trap even if I got to scrap
I'll lay a nigga down flat before I'll let him hold me back
Ya see I ain't afraid of obstacles
But what you niggas call impossible is possible
Yeah, so aye

[Refrain]

Aye, some niggas take they life for granted, wastin' time
Time is money my nigga, I cannot waste a dime
Or a minute, too much business to handle to be sleepin'
Too much spinach to eat for niggas beefin'
So I'm out here trick or treatin', can my niggas comprehend
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, motherfucker let me in
Stop hatin' that's a sin, why these niggas so sinful
I guess they hate to love a nigga, yes it's that simple
As I ride through the city, feelin' lucky to be breathin'
I know a couple peers that didn't make it to the season, pour it out
See I believe that things happen for a reason, no doubt
Strange times, as I watch these niggas throw they gang signs, and they strapped
Crips or Blood, nigga we all black
From the same city, the same schools we was taught at
Aye fuck the drawbacks and obstacles
Man what them teachers call impossible is possible nigga, yeah

[Hook]
Our love (love) our love, Our love (love)
Love the sound of love, love the sound of love
Playing in my mind, playing when I find you

[Verse 1: Voli]
Uh, yeah, uh, baby, uh
Do you hear the sound of love? I can take you higher than the clouds above
Let me do you well, I can make you wet like a fountain does
How much sin can you live with? Unwrap you like a gift on Christmas
Tornado, let me twist ya like licorice, distasteful but so delicious
Oh my, I feel ya I'm getting nearer, stand up hold on to the mirror
Make you come again, ahem, couldn't hear ya
Uh, let me feel you breathe, I can't leave till I feel you came
Mmm, my ears will bleed, sound of love, can I hear you scream?

[Pre-Hook]
I turn the lights off and turn you on, oh oh
And turn the music down just to hear you moan
Go down low, turn the volume up
Listen close, can you hear the sound of love?

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Yeah, uh
Took my time before I hit that, yeah, treated it like a free throw
Now this the moment I been thinking of, what I been waitin‚ all week for
Where your bad side hide at, huh? I know you got a little freak, though
You sing a song when you ride that, but you a little off beat though
But, girl don't you hold back, say what you feel
Just take your cool off, this is for real
Before we take these clothes off, lets make a deal
You make me say, oh and uh, I'll make you squeal

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Voli]
Yah, let me breathe you in, floor's good enough don't need no bed
You don't gotta take you clothes off for me, I rip them off like I owe
Them money
Bad girl, good lord, rodeo I'mma get you off
Time bomb, let me set you off, after that come get some more

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and  J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave a note
Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this song
Thought they knew me well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
But happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Bridge: Jhené Aiko]
Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can’t forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It’ll get better

[Hook: Jhené Aiko]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly

[Intro]
Yeah, hahaha
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
Real niggas can relate, yeah
Hahaha, Ville niggas can relate, man
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I see you looking at me hard shawty, what it's gonna be?
But you right next to your man, don't let him run up on me
'Cause I see him tryna grill, better take his ass home
Before I lay his ass out, then I take ya ass home
I even gon' front man a nigga tryna cut
I ain't tryna take his place, I just want to hit you up
When that nigga ain't around I just want to pick you up
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up
Then I give you a massage, get you wet, get you up
Then I give you what you want, if it's clean I lick it up
Now you can do me, if it's right my shit is up
Face down on your stomach, take that ass and lift it up

[Chorus]
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
'Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up

[Verse 2]
I be that nigga on the side when you feel you want to creep
When you in the bed alone why ya man run the street
All you got to do is dial, let the phone ring twice
Baby girl I love your style, I won't even think twice
I ain't even gonna front, man a nigga tryna beat
I ain't tryna wife you up, though you is a dime piece
I just love the way you ride like a certified freak
How you throw it right back, got a niggas thighs weak
So just hit me when you want it, you know how to find me
Got no times for no games, you know how the grind be
But-I'm a make the time if you bout' it dial me
I'm a make you say my name like a caller ID

[Chorus]
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
'Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up

[Verse 3]
Give you money to get ya hair did-he can do that!
Pay for dinner and a movie-yea he can do that!
Work you out in the bed-maybe he can do that
But I know you much rather call me to do that
And girl I'm with it! Haha, yea
I'm so with it, babygirl I'm so with it!
So let me hit it!

[Chorus]
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
'Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up



[Verse 1]
You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I skate town, catch a Greyhound
Change my name right, catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know they’ll lock me if I stay
But where I’mma run to
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and yet I’d love to
But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to
Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you
That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay

[Hook]
Stay

[Verse 2]
Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step
I’m gettin’ grown now
And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes around
Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay
Although I love it here
I’ll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother here
Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that
Let’s show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay

[Hook]



[Refrain]

[Verse 1:Nas]
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas
Family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone
Kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse
She fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first
Can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona
I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one
That's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer
Licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son
She got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex
So I guess I'mma just stay

[Refrain]

[Verse 2:Nas]
Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you
Don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you
I might kill you but do I got love for you
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time
Want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love
What a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me
I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer
Pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to stay


[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear

[Intro]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right

[Hook]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right

[Verse 1]
Took off my work badge, realize I'm back in the hood
Like what's good, my cousin called, told me he coming through
Like "Yo what up, why you back bruh?
See you should be laying tracks with J. Cole and who knows
Maybe he sign yo ass
See I don't know just how this rap thing go
From the looks of it you closer than most niggas that I know
Please explain, way I see it bruh, you paving lanes
What you don't believe cause boy your songs did some things for me
Had me thinking we was trapped, but Lute you set us free
Niggas stay focused, when it's right for you, it's meant to be
Every time I play a song you gain a fan
Nigga you the man, drop a song, what you waiting  on?
You in high demand and that's life
Only one time to get it right
Take a flight, view this world from a different height
See this hood still the same, no matter how you view it
You got dreams, I just rather you pursue it
Just promise you never change, I don't care just how you do it
Fuck them niggas you ain't gotta prove shit
And see this hood still the same, no matter what you doing
So for you I empty out a whole clip"

[Hook]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right

[Verse 2]
As I let the Chevy skate, like Tradewinds back in the day
Wish upon these stars like "God, show me that way"
Cause ain't no looking back
Been in the trap so long, I'm tired of shooting back
Keep your eyes peeled, don't let the steel hit you
Envy be that bitch that fuck the niggas that chill with you
That's why I can never trust these niggas
Trigger finger itchin', contemplating should I pull it
Lost more friends to bullshit than a bullet
Brother Pooh called me up, he told me stay consistent
"The fact that you yourself what make you different
Like fuck the gold chains, diamond rings
Keep your eyes on the prize, that don't make a difference
Cause you're still a young king without the bling
Keep your eyes on the prize, shine on these niggas"

[Hook]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right

[Outro]
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right



[J. Cole]
Uhh, what if somebody from the ville that was ill
Got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn’t talkin bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Can’t you see I’m putting it down
Look this is the Roc bitch
The new Roc bitch
They had it locked well I just copped a new lock bitch
Look how I hit em up I’m on some 2Pac shit
We take it to a higher level two octaves
Cole, nigga I’m vicious with the flow
Don’t take no cristal ball to predict that I would blow so quick
Get on your current events
Oh you ain't heard of that quit
No endurance, no insurance
You should be so embarrassed
Nigga you could have signed me
Now you little artist is garbage running behind me so
You wanna drop a man, your litter too much
Now get back to rap you niggas twitter too much
But I keep it hood I could fit in Ku Klux
I ain't bitter with you pitiful fuck niggas
Couldn’t tie my tennis shoes
Couldn’t reach this high if you hit a few blunts
Sound like who, ahh bitches you nuts please
I run circles round these rap urkels
And if he act Hercules then he could smack purple
Relax this is the Roc and guess who stuntin for us
And yeah I run my own show nigga Martin Lawrence

[Young Chris]
Young Boy outta Philly who was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
And way before he put together words
Them niggas was selling birds
Guess who puttin it down
This is the Roc trick that old Roc shit
I got it locked, I supply the whole block bitch
Gimme the loot listen to that old BIG shit
And we dont care about no vest’s get your wig hit
See that boy vicious on the mic
Flow tighter than a girdle on bitches on a flight
Tight, pray for a bright day visions of a night
Good weed, little liquor pretty bitches get me right
Baby I’m a baller, I was born in March Madness
Whats the clarity its a little bit flaw in your carrots
Silly rabbits little bastards nigga all of y’all average
I be the youngest Jackson with the glove I’m the baddest
Get the baddest whore’s dime a dozen on tour
Box em out in the paint, d-cousins on boards
Hip hop deserve more for the strength of what we saw
Give an encore for Biggie smalls shakur
Big L and Pun, rest in peace to Pimp
The way they paved the way I could never be content
Give it up to underdog, highly underrated
And this ones dedicated to the ones appreciated
Good look…
[End]



Now I know that you been waiting
And I thank you for your patience
I'm sorry for the wait
I had a lot up on my plate
And I ain't talking a buffet
They say
I had a shot and I just took a pump fake

But wait, who ever gave you the crystal ball?
You barely read at all and now you think you reading palms?
I had enough of being what you people sleeping on
I can't be comfortable with being someone's comforter

I'm finna be the bomb, you don't see the fuse?
I promise when this tape drop you gon feel the boom!
But I guess once again it's time to prove it
I told you on Illusions that I ain't never losing
So don't ever think I've lose love for the craft
Dark clouds turn to blue sky's on this path

Where you never smell the stench of a lost
Cause success is my cologne,you can smell what I got on
When I walk into a room, cause baby I'm a winner
My writtens resemble kennels or a prison cause spittin

A money driven nigga
So for the cash, I be in that Kardashin' like I'm Bruce Jenner
Before Kris took his last name
Lost in my thoughts and still looking for that damn train

I ain't never quitting
I seen my Mom work a job that she hated just so I could have some dinner
Raising a son and two girls with no father figure
And stayed strong so the world's what I gotta give her

And Momma we was meant to win
I make it big you ain't never paying rent again
You whack rappers need to take heed
Who force feed people bullshit and mislead

But nigga I ain't buying the lies
So you betta keep the receipts for all that deceit
Look this shit is like riding a bike and right now
I know I'm on that ten speed

They can't believe that, but this ain't Ripley's
I'm spittin' the naked truth making bad bitches strip tease

Man this industry is full of shark
And they're attracted to the flow cause they know I let the pen bleed
It's time to make the top of the charts
And that shit ain't never been walk in the park

Especially when you bring light to the dark
Man been hella dope from the start
So you don't need a stethoscope to know
That everything you hearings coming straight from the heart

And this is straight for the art and the craft
Man I'm tryna take ya thoughts out the trash
Before you crash
So I show you to a path that you never thought that you had

In my mind, its get rich time
I know you see it in the air like a crip sign
But I ain't never banged a gang
I'm just taking about my reign as I change the game

[Verse 1]
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (Maybe I'll stay)
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

[Spoken Interlude]

Y'all feeling alright man, make some motherfuckin' noise one time
This shit crazy, man y'all don't even realize this shit is like
This shit is unreal man lemme- lemme talk to y'all for a second
I want to talk to y'all- because
It's cool for me to come out here tonight
It's just an honor to be able to fuckin' sell out the Crown and shit and come back home and this shit is retarded in itself I appreciate y'all, thank you man
But it's one thing for me to come out here tonight and just perform the whole album for y'all, that's already amazing, thank y'all for letting me do that shit, you know what I mean that's already crazy
Niggas don't do that type of shit, perform they whole albums
But it's one thing to just come and do the songs, that's cool, I love doing that I do that every day of my life
But, me personally, I like to use the shows as an opportunity that I don't ever really get like that
But I love to do it
And that's the opportunity to come here and speak directly to y'all and have y'all feel every word that I'm fuckin' saying to you that's what I like to do
So right now, I want to talk to y'all about- this song right here that I just did
The name of that song is called St. Tropez right, that's the name of that song, St. Tropez
But if I'm being honest with y'all
If I'm keeping it funky
If I'm being real
If I'm keeping it a hunnid
Or if I'm keeping it fo' hunnid how my nigga YG fo' hunnid be fuckin' saying
He love YG, look at him (laughs) aight'
If I'm being real, then the truth is
Nigga, I don't even know where the fuck St. Tropez is at
I don't know it's at
I don't give a fuck (laughs)
When I talk about St. Tropez in the song-
What I do know about St. Tropez is, it seems like the type of place that really rich people go to when they got a lot of fuckin' money and they wanna vacation and be on a yacht with champagne glasses and bikinis- it seem like that type of place
But when I talk about it on this song it's just a metaphor
What this song is about, and y'all gon' feel me, y'all gon' feel me cause I'm home, and y'all gon' feel me
What this song is about, and a lot of people don't understand this cause I be doing shows in New York, Los Angeles, you know fuckin' Chicago, big ass cities
So they don't feel me, they don't know what it's like to be somebody that's from a small town, a place like Fayetteville you know what I mean they don't know what it's like
They can't really relate to that shit, so what I'm trying to explain to them is
When I'm talking about St. Tropez on this song it's just a metaphor
We grow up our whole- our whole lives watching TV, looking at the movies, seeing places like what- like Paris, London England, St. Tropez, New York City, Chicago, L.A. right?
And as a kid from Fayetteville what do we tell ourselves?
"Man one day I'ma go there, one day I'ma go there" right?
What ends up happening?
A lot of times because we come from a small town what happens?
We suffer from what we call a small-town mentality now what does that mean?
That means we grow up our whole lives seeing these places, and we tell ourselves we gon' go
But as we grow up we get way too comfortable in our comfort zone, right?
And we too afraid to leave, right?
That's why so many people- ain't really stepping out the city like that, they too afraid to go right?
So what I'm talking about on this song is tryna give y'all insight to the mentality that I had to overcome
If you know anything about my story you know when I turned 18 I said "fuck this shit" I moved all the way to New York City I ain't know nobody in fucking New York- but I left
I left the Ville and I went to New York I took a leap of faith
Fast forward the rest is history
Right now- listen
I want to take a break from all this album shit
And I want to perform a song that only- only those people that's been fucking with me from day one is gon' fuck with
I don't know how many people in here that been fucking with me

[Intro: J. Cole]
Pyrex whipper
Niggas want smoke, mmh
Niggas want smoke, I want it too, mmh
Niggas want, mmh, niggas want, mmh
CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
2-6 god, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slippin', Cinderell-ayy
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
I wanna pop my shit
I wanna cop my whip in cash
On that note, pull up on them folks
In an all black Ghost like Christmas Past
Vicious ass
Low-key rich with the same outfit that I did just have
Pardon the smoke, that's just my staff
Quik Stop, never seen this much gas, nigga
I got a story to tell you to speak for the niggas that never could speak for theyself
I was off Cumberland Road when a couple of niggas mistook me for somebody else
I put the pedal to metal when I seen the muzzle, I couldn't help but think to myself
Boy, keep your ass in the house, the city is bad for your health

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
2-6 god, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slippin', Cinderell-ayy
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga

[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
(Y'all really with the shit)
Pull up on your block, ain't no hesitation (Skrrt, yeah)
Hit you with the stick, try to run, you ain't gon' make it (Huh?)
Whole lot of money on your head, gotta take it (Yeah, I do)
Roll through your hood like some dice, we gon' shake it (We gon' shake it)
Bitch turned up in the spot booty shakin', yeah (Nasty)
I like this bitch gettin' naked, yeah (Yeah, bitch)
Fuck for the money, she crazy, huh (Yeah, bitch)
Paradise East, from the bricks, yeah, they made me
Nigga wanna hate, gettin' money, say I'm crazy (Okay)
Shit bankroll, ain't nothin' but big faces
Spread it in your face, make a motherfucker hate me
Whole lot of money, make me wanna come take it
I'm in the hood where this shit ain't safe
It's okay, got a Glock, AK
Niggas try to play, I'ma hit 'em in the face

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
2-6 god, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slippin', Cinderell-ayy
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga



[Verse 1]
Ay
All this fightin' shit I kinda love it
Them tears, at least you're feelin' somethin'
For a minute I felt you're goin' numb
No calls, did you get forget my number?

[Chorus]
I, used to love you
Love you, love you, love you like you never been loved before
Now it's just fuck you
Fuck you fuck me like I ain't fucked up enough
Told me he hurt you before
I tried to be better, oh
Damn I got issues with hoes
In different area codes
With this good dick on they mind
But I'm supposed to be yours
Good God why can't I supply
Luh

[Verse 2]
Ay
All this fightin' shit I know you hate
All the points you make, I got debates
And we can end this if you want to
And I just say that shit to hurt you

[Chorus]
And I, used to love you
Love you, love you, love you like you never been loved before
Now it's just fuck you
Fuck you fuck me like I ain't fucked up enough
Told me he hurt you before
I tried to be better, oh
Damn I got issues with hoes
In different area codes
With this good dick on they mind
But I'm supposed to be yours
Good God why can't I supply
Love



[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, yo, niggas don't want drama (nah)
See they talk proper, but when it comes time to spark
They all tryna catch alzheimers
You all talking no wack shit
You outta get smacked faggot
I seen harder niggas in drag
I'm bigger than that
So test me, don't even ask about it
Do the math and count it
You ain't got half the talent
Niggas laugh and doubt it
But only 'till my cash is sprouted
Put up your best track, I'll run laps around it
Yo, I'm coming for death, you running for life
Fuck a gun or a knife
My numbers is right
Enough of this hype
Let's get to it
Nigga you sick, prove it
Your style's transparent
Mr. Magoo could look through it
And it's true I'm not a thug, but I handle mines
And grammar wise you analyze, I vandalize
Which man standing trying to get branded with death
Falling off stage with a mic stand on your chest
Yo, take a number
Cause all these niggas thinking they can rumble with the rapist
Suffer from some sort of brain disorder
The rain is pouring now
Nigga check the brain storm
Won't stop until my name is embroidered on the gravestone

[Hook: ?]
The therapist boy you like collab
A pair of fist lefty
Mr. do right have's
And there's your [?]
Embarrassment, how bad too delicate for carelessness
You out your element
Syrhenz (×4)
You out your element
Syrhenz (×4)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Loose cannon, when I shoot amateurs
Truth [?]
Ain't a crew standing can do damage
This shit is rock solid
Niggas bark harder than rottweilers
I rock polish, I spit top notch
You rock bottom
Assed out, my raps similar to a crack house
So dope these niggas take two puffs then pass out
Relax now, never back down
When the bells rung, cause I serve beef raw but well done
You can tell hell where I hail from
The reigning champ, main event rhyming
Y'all still in training camp
Fucking with me so you gotta be nice
But you got better odds trying to hit the lottery twice
Nucka, stop the nonsense or get knocked unconscious
The rhymes I'm designing is monstrous
My arsenal bomb shit
Got the haters loving it now
Watch my shit hit the ceiling
'Till it's covered in brown

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
The therapist leading the pack
Type of cat to ball
You call without asking, no bringing it back
I'm made checking
Place your wages and bets
The stakes is raising
If you ain't gotcha money on me, you brain's defecting
Pains ejecting, whenever my name is mentioned
The games is lynching, hang and hitch me
This natural instinct
More than half you faggots against me
Now watch as I turn this beat to minced meat
Case closed, snap souls along with pesos
My entire camp play cold, below the waist blows
Never take no for responses, I'm word boxing
You [?] watch as I flip and take the world hostage

[Bridge: J. Cole]
The therapist niggas
Yo, you out your element
What the fuck niggas thinking 'bout
Yo, check it, yo
You out your element
Yeah niggas, yo you out your element
What the fuck ya'll niggas thinking 'bout

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Tears for ODB, drug-induced poetry
What’s the use? Strung-out from that drug abuse, woe is me
80's baby, so I know my pops was gettin’ high
In the 90's, me and mama barely gettin’ by
2000's I was concentratin’ more on gettin’ fly
Gettin’ bitches, gettin’ rich to get the shit I couldn’t buy
You know the story, you know my allegory
I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they’d better warn y’all
I’m here for more than just to kick some witty metaphors, dawg
This more of the type of shit you spit to set a war off
‘Cause niggas be poor, get money and still don’t know
Why the fuck they can’t cop a house, the system meant to lock us out
But I’m knockin’ down the door, strapped up with a four-four
Robin Hood, shit and yeah, I’m ‘hood rich
That’s good enough to stay in new kicks and a good whip
Get good head from a good bitch, I give two shits, I’mma tell you straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch

[Verse 2]
Lord have mercy on my soul, what I’ve done and what I’ve seen
My life has tumbled into that which only you could intervene
I put my heart in senseless things: money, bitches and street shit
Fascinated by beef, sad to say I won’t be shit
Grew up in this bitch without a pot to piss in, no toilet
How ironic, I took a lot of shit, like a bottom bitch
Or a model chick, high off coke
They lockin’ sons up for less, I don’t care how y’all cope
But yet I still peddle this dope and these pills
I’ll never know how sittin’ comfy on that Oprah seat feels
More than likely be on Most Wanted posters, we still
Holdin’ on to old dreams of bein’ Hova, be real
We the forgotten souls, bottom of the totem poles
Left for dead, some niggas fled, people said they sold their souls
I just think they found a better way, Lord knows I never pray
But sometimes I be wishin’ I could levitate, I’ll take it straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch

[Outro]



Tröim vom Tell ire Winternacht

[Intro: JaVonte,  J. Cole]
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, often I'm caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gena face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly
Look, shawty, ain't no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don' seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell 'em "please refrain."
I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame
Cause tonight, I got you calling out Jesus name, hey

[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Often I'm caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
To try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, I'm ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devil's song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that I'm a pyro
Maniac, I said "Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best."
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then "ding ding," the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
I'm starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say, yo?

[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

[Outro: J. Cole]
I'm losing temptation

[Verse 1: King Mez]
What the name of my team be
Fresh Heirs believe me
Only kings in my circle boy
Instrumental they feed me
Women from your television trying be where my seed be
We be like pardon, but no hoes in the garden
TV watered from the rain that I started when I departed
I left the average niggas who wondering where they heart is
Equivalent to none like one minus one
Or the Catholic women who skin don't see sun
Yeah, I could have been arrogant, but I was humble by my tears
Always was bright, but now my candle chandeliers
I was supposed to get degrees, live life as an engineer
But surpassing all of my peers, got my mind on Damier, yeah
Elegant women and they friends, in my 700 Benz
They wondering what I spend, I'm wondering 'bout my spins
They said I get my rank up when I'm adding onto my sins
But I really don't see the stripes like the bottom of my 10's
But then when I think again, I won't be caught up in this trance
But how do I know for sure, it's different when you see them ends
My nigga go for broke, only got one life to live
I mean I know you got your girl but now every city it's some tens
In every hotel lobby, who know your name and probably came
So you can get 'em naughty
And beat it up til' it may weather, no Arturo Gatti
I mean it's tempting, these are the fruits of my labor
But I contradict, telling her respect the body
But about that quick, baby girl that fit, but my mind on my paper
Margiela killer, Louis, Louboutin all in my favour
But my girl better have some J's, it be that or the Vapors
Bonnie & Clyde type stride, committing our capers
Infrared lasers at this evil minded enterprise
Princess says only into guys prince is only in her thighs
To all the ignorant entertainers that's helping our demise
Even when a fool hold his peace he considered wise
Ain't no need to flow nigga, rain says the weatherman
Leave that job to me pimping, flash flood veteran
Never ride with niggas only trip with who they better than
Imagining the crowns on my sisters and my brethren
I'm looking up in the night sky, trying to find my stars
Passing by them dealerships, trying to find my cars
But now I see you artists and question your moral targets
I won't judge you but I sentence you rappers behind my bars
And that's life dog, somebody in my city won't make it through the night dog
And I'm supposed to be throwing money, that's right dog?
I mean, alright dog

[Outro: Drey Skonie]
I walk into the corner shop
Somewhere I never been before
I ain't tryina die no more
And right now I
Like it's never been before
I'm ready I'm sure
See the allure



[Intro]
Just turn the beat down just a little bit

[Verse 1]
They say anythings possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can ho
They try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas ass no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Simply had to approach, "what's up young blood?"
Ain't it strange, a year ago today, my nigga, I was counting change
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city
Though I gotta thank God, cause if you weren’t with me
Then I surely woulda died, you can throw the fork in me
This my New Years resolution, dawg
No more Pork in me, uh, I ain't no Muslim though
Caron Butler I’m a wizard if ya doesn't know
Its young Simba, I’m ballin’ 'til the buzzer blow
You try and kick the shit I kick now you gon stub your toe
Boy thats just how tough I go, see this is my light work
This shit you callin' classic, I be like that might work
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dyke work
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst

[Break 1]
Not tonight nigga
Not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Man, man, hey

[Verse 2]
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma, momma who don’t like me
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me
I hit her till she snooze, like the news nigga nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
Now she bitter with this nigga cause he ain't quite me
One things for certain babygirl, you are a wifey, two things for fucking sure
I am not the husband though, so run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah thats a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interupt something real, damn
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn’t say that you a ho, just made a ho decision
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibition
We both know thats what you wanted girl
I know you listening

[Break 2]
Hey
Girl, I know you listening
Uh, I know you listening
Hey, yeah

[Verse 3]
Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online tryna find my shit
And to the niggas listening but won't buy my shit
And catch me in the street and wanna ride my dick
Y’all niggas is the worst, see me like
“J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD”
Nigga please, an album ten dollars
You act like it’s ten g’s
This food for thought cost the same as 2 number three’s
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel ya pain, therefore I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh shit
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and a whole lot more shit
That got richer and still rapping like I’m poor shit
You niggas think you know shit, man you don’t know shit

[Outro]
Ho bitch
Yeah, Cole Bitch
J Cole nigga
Hey



[Produced by J Cole]

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Yea, keep following me, keep calling me
Yea, yea, yea

Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed
The beauty of life, the pain never last
The rain always past, the sun don’t always shine
When its gone I'm lonely, but when its there Im fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think Im a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
Its funny, 100 years ago I woulda called this nigga master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say Im easily distracted I think the problem is Im easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following

[Verse 2: Omen]
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard
Nights with no progress
Mane im thinking like I'll probably find a Loch Ness
In the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping Im reaching for closeness
Feel like the devil keep following me
Feel like the devil keep following me, uh



[Verse]

Okay, I told rap niggas I was sick as a bitch
They ain't believe it, ain't nobody sicker than this
I'm pistol whipping ya chick with my platinum dick
I'm gifted, walking on water, you slipping on piss
Nigga I'm flipping the script, hitting the switch, hit em with this
Hit or a miss, I kill it with a flick of the wrist
Been in it since the internet had little effect
Adrenaline was kicking in and shit was getting intense, hold up

Above par, a large part of the parcel
Park your mouth 'fore you get it parked in a hospital
Or right next to a parked Benz, or a park bench, uhh
Alliteration is far fetched

I gotta pour me a tall glass
And murder a session, them niggas hoping I fall back
Did for a second and I forgot I was all that
Wait a minute
Why's everybody in all black?

I'm having - visions of me and my niggas just killing it
It's vivid, I'm feeling like we in the middle of everything they feeling it
And we drilling it, into the system
You niggas listening?
Hop in the booth, will I make a killing?
Will I be relevant or underrated until I quit it?
Will I rise above all the limits?
And show the critics that killing is a given for me
The talent given to me is limitless, admittedly
One of the realest, the metaphysical epitome of excellence
Depicted in a sense that eases residents
I've embraced the melanin I've been given to live with
And in a sense I am livid my people have not been lifted
Look, I think you getting too deep nigga
They been sleeping on us counting sheep nigga
Know how many times that I ain't sleep in those high school weeks nigga?
Don't you ever call me weak nigga



[Verse 1]
I'm on The Come Up
Chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga, finna rise and shine like the sun up
My mind on that paper, I ain't trying to wife the slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't trying to wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up
Uh, don't shed a tear if a nigga might get done up
But, just say a prayer if a nigga might confront us
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the 'Ville? You need to get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, Cobain a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flame, baking soda and water
And if you feel that then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggas like a nigga was still a baby
Carolina nigga shout-out to the 'Ville that raised me
So many hoes whipped, you would've thought we still in slavery
And niggas still sleepin' they feelin' lazy
Uh, a killer maybe, you make me I will
Cheat me on my scrilla, I send you to meet Dilla
From them NC streets where the beef they deliver
And the clip is on E cause your chest got a fill up
While a nigga like me is just getting head like a pillow
Bread like gorillas getting bred
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed
Fuck what a nigga said, man, I'm Fayettenam bombing
Cause hatred is flattery you bitch niggas is charmin'
Who the fuck you harmin'? Boy, ya'll niggas is charmin'
And I'm armed and waiting for a target
You fucking with the best like Carmen
Aw shit, pardon a nigga for departing
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden
A nigga finna blow while you niggas is false alarmin'
And just think, man, I was raised on ramen -- chicken noodle soup
Now I'm filet mignon-in'
I promised my momma I was coming to make this money
And I swear I'm going to kill the nigga that try to take it from me

[Outro]
Yeah, that's real talk, nigga
It's J. Cole, nigga
Therapist whatever the fuck you wanna call him, it don't matter
You know, I'll make y'all niggas understand man
I know you can't believe yourself right now
You thinkin' this niggas from the south, hahaha
He can't spit, how the fuck is he so good?
Open your eyes motherfucker, can you see? Niggas on top
Yup, we on top



[Intro]
Cole World, the new Nat King
If I ain't the illest nigga, I'm his new vaccine
Really more like poison when his New Jack Swing
And my bed is like a deck of cards - two black queens
A nigga don't like me, he just a fucking hater
What you made last week, I just tipped the fucking waiter
What that feel like? Tell me what that feel like?
Nigga fuck your Twitter, bitches follow me in real life

[Interlude]
Welcome back, ladies and gentleman, to a brand new season. Dreamville, Cole World. So much has happened in our time apart
I can’t wait to share it with you all in due time. Did you miss me?
I know I missed you. Can’t believe these niggas ain’t rap on this shit man...

[Verse 1]
Heard niggas got beef
Then they see me on the street, and don't speak
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak
Yeah, I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips
Meanwhile I’m on the strip, putt puttin’ wit ya bitch
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160
Bitch don’t fuck with me, trust nigga I’m sick
Can’t tag me, fuck nigga I’m it—watch this
With my heart on my sleeve I bleed pardon my greed
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity
How can it be I blew up singlehandedly
Nobody handed me shit
Granted though, I planned to be rich
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly
On cameras but won’t holla at family only randomly
After a few drinks come our realest convos
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo’s
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I’m still mulatto
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said “hell if I know,” shit
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming
Name should be Abe Lincoln ‘cause I cannot tell a lie though
All facts in fact, been all that
Before Kenan and Kel swallow the key to my cell
Which means, I got an impossible lock to pick
And if you want my spot, you gotta go through lots of shit
Nigga, Cole the truth, you the opposite
I be tryna figure out why I cannot commit
With who I’ve known for years, is it hoes or fear
Meanwhile she wonder if the one she chose is pure
No cure for the cold, rather Cole the cure
Them last lines was more honest than your whole career
Nigga, you a phony, only got few homies
I prefer lonely, you rap niggas don’t know me
Staying to myself, not concerned ‘bout my health
I’m a mothafucka and yo baby mother is a milf
Couple years ago they had a nigga sitting on the shelf
Now they tell me “man you like the realest shit I ever smelt”
They say, “Boy you got the belt"
"Plus you better than so-and-so!”
I keep it modest but inside I already know it though
Yea thanks my nigga, yea thanks my nigga
I deserve but nah this ain’t Tank my nigga
Leave the party like I just robbed a bank my nigga
Bag full of money, fuck yo debate my nigga
‘Cause two years ago and I ain’t make it, I was pissed
But you care a little less about a list when you rich, nigga
When you rich nigga...

[Interlude]
But that’s not what we came here for. We didn’t come here to brag; we didn’t come here to boast, to stunt. We just came here to flex. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your patience. I assure you, it’ll be well worth the wait. In the meantime, if I can get right back into it though. Check it...

[Verse 2]
How many Kanye beats do a nigga gotta murder
To prove my mind’s further, hater nigga converter
Took kids to Carowinds which I’m sure you never heard of
‘Cause I didn’t tell the news or the Fayetteville Observer
I don’t do it for the press, I’m blessed, I made it out
Sitting on this plane, my biggest thing to complain about
Somewhere between yesterday and now
I done lost my jewelry, Rollies, chains, almost lost my cool
But see, I just left kids who ain’t got a fucking thing
‘Cept a lot of fucking problems and a lot of fucking pain
And here I go bitching ‘cause my Jesus piece missing
Got a feeling housekeeping finally caught a nigga slipping
Eyes wide open, they just found a pot of gold
Now lil’ Julio is somewhere shining on you hoes
But that’s how it goes, fuck it I’m still breathing
Like my lil’ nigga Jaheim, we here for a reason

[Outro]
That’s my lil’ man Jaheim. He said, “Cole, can you shout me out on a song?” I was like, “I don’t know man,” but in my mind I knew I would shout him out though, you know—Fayettenam, 2-6. Dreamville. We from a different world. Cole World...



Relax nigga
We Gon make it, if you keep spitting on these tracks nigga
I don't have a choice, being I'm just a black nigga
Coming out the ghetto or sewer just like a rat nigga
Mama told me, I'm bout to blow in a couple months
I thought I'd never see support till I'm in the front
Of the people that gotta hand over a Grammy
I'm just forever dreaming until I'm chillin in Miami
On the beach, with bad women around me
Good vibes, for another hood guy puttin on my hood guys
Got a couple people intimidated, I'm guaranteed to make it
Or like a bully in school, I'm guaranteed to take it
Ha, my grandmother don't approve of the shit I do
I'm rappin just to make her smile and she don't have a clue
She prolly think that I'm doing it just because it's cool
But I was better off rapping, then tryna go to school
See. Her credit jacked
And my credit jacked
And my mother credit...
Yeah her credit jacked
So what's a better stat?
With our credit jacked...
Make a bigger debt
Or making hella tracks
Making hella tracks, could turn to hella stacks
And with them hella stacks, we'll bring our credit back
That's only words, until I make it to verbs
I'm just rappin. Out these lyrical blurbs
My brother told me to chill with all that bad mouthin
Dissin all these other rappers cause they not about it
I'm never showing no hate, it's just these people doubtin
And when it come to this music, nigga I'm bout it, bout it
It ain't no limit
Im Percy miller in 95
Got a crew full of soldiers and they down to ride
Made mistakes that put me over in 2nd place
But I ain't trippin cause slow and steady will win the race
My only occupation isnt just a spitter, but a winner, you niggas beginners
I'm keeping my head up to the sky, yet I'm still a sinner
But that man above understand the world I'm in
Just to survive in this cold world you gotta sin
I'm only 21, Tryna find a way
I know I'm living better than many, I'm smiling every day
Give a bum a dollar every time I can
I could be in the same position, forgetting who I am
Never Hollywood, tryna get to Hollywood
It sound good and relaxing like a Molly would
If I ain't have this job, man I prolly would
Pop a couple and put on a front like tommy would
That's Martin tho, I need Martin dough
But I ain't willing to go the route that Martin go
Cause when niggas think ya funny
They thinkin that it's okay and they can play with ya money, nah
A lil this, a lil that, I be working voodoo
Warming up to eat a track, like some ramen noodles
Rome told me not to black and that's all I could do
Cause my brother said that's what a rapper should do
...if he good or whatever
A million rappers in the world pick a letter
Put him up against me, he ain't better
He just started rappin for  cheese, a mouse for the cheddar
But then again that's what we all want
I love music, but money....shit I can't front
Whatever is to happen
I'm hoping that my future is filled with satisfaction



[Intro: kiLL edward]
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Yeah

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology
I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily "Why you not with me?"
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

[Pre-Chorus: kiLL edward]
Time will tell who is on my side
(Time will tell just who is on my side)
I mean well but I can't stop my pride
(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Bridge: kiLL edward]
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: kiLL edward]
Time will tell who is on my side
(Time will tell just who is on my side)
I mean well but I can't stop my pride
(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know



[Intro]
Yo I don't even know man
Maybe I'm the only one who sees how wack this nigga is
Like the rest of these niggas like this nigga or something you know
Fucking 33 years old trying to get respect nigga
Get a life, feed your family man god damn

[Verse]
Why the fuck would you jump to step to
A motherfucker such as myself nigga i deck you
Lay you out beat the shit out you until you confess to
Being the weakest nigga out homosexual, shit
You jock me and talk shit cause you not me
I'm cocky this faggots riding my dick, a jockey
Try me, nigga your shit's jokes you Cosby
I'm Ali, bitch I'm the king you Rodney (Get it)
How dare you try compare yourself to me
Coming at mines you embarrass yourself
So please ease off my dick, worry bout your own shit
I got the skills to pay the bills bitch you homeless
On this microphone it's no joke I'm focused
So, you provoke get throat choked and toasted
You shit is not hot man, god damn yo
You tied for the wackest nigga alive besides Van Gogh
And you hate, how i get props and u can't
Trying to rap at age 48 it's too late
You think you can fuck around but you wait
You great, son you must but slow as a Screw tape
Whats wrong with you, you all bent of shape
Sobbing like your moms whipped you cause i wouldn't do a song with you
Poor slut, washed up, still rapping
How can I call you a has been, you never have been
The most wanted, most boasts but don't want it
The flows rugged, please know I'm cold blooded
This ho done it about to get his dome crushed in
With these words I'm sick, you ain't even got a nose running
Pussy ass artificial [?]
Trying to brag you some kind of fucking central [?]
But, you don't really think that I'm impressed with that do you
I win your wack ass title and give it back to you
Cause it's nothing you still hitting me given me praise
You face me wait, nigga is your weed laced
You too old for this dawg you's a freed slave
You album and Shyne Po got the same release date
You loosing it, I'm bruising lips with this music shit
You gotta get used to it
And now I'm abusing this fucking stupid trick from Houston
Excuse my french but you's a bitch
You's predictable, you joke that I'm half white (Yeah, yeah)
That's nice still don't change the fact that you rap like
You back on the crack pipe, faggots a sad sight
Fag type, sticking flashlights up your ass pipe
You wanted beef so I'm dishing it out son
Before the bout's beginning I'm predicting the outcome
Step in the ring nigga with or without gloves
You be throwing the towel the beginning of round one
And I ain't got no sympathy for you neither
This battles a time out, I'm getting a breather
You easier than 1, 2, 3 your fucking weak raps
Just like my girlfriend, i know i can beat that

[Outro]
What Nigga?
Your whole sets blown
I fuck around and put you in a rest home
I'm professional, this shit is boot camp
I'm a 100 dollar bill you's a food stamp
Ravenous the faggot, the senior citizen with a bad back
A massive limp from his plastic hip
You never could be as nice
This nigga used to have a rap group with Jesus Christ



[Intro: Spoken]
Yo, I don't even know man
Maybe I’m the only one that sees how whack this nigga is
You know what I’m sayin’?
Like the rest of these niggas, like this nigga or something
You know?
Fucking 33 years old, tryin’ to get respect
Nigga get a life, feed your family man
Goddamn

[Verse 1:]
Yo, yo
Why the fuck would you jump, to step to a motherfucker such as myself?
Nigga I Tec you, lay you out
Beat the shit out of you, til’ you confess to being the weakest nigga out
And homosexual shit, you jock me, and talk shit ‘cause you not me
I’m cocky, this faggot's riding my dick, a jockey
Try me, nigga, your shits jokes, you Cosby, I’m Ali
Bitch, I’m the king you Rodney, you get it?
How dare you try comparing yourself to me?
Coming in mines you embarrassing yourself
So please, ease off my dick, worry ‘bout your own shit
I got skills to pay the bills, bitch, you homeless
On this microphone, its no joke, I’m focused
So, you provoke and throat choke, then toasted
Your shit is not hot man, goddamn yo
You tied for the whackest nigga alive, besides Van Gogh
And you hate, how I get props and you can’t
Tryna rap at age 48, it’s too late
And you fake, you can fuck around, but you ain’t
You cray, son you must be slow as a screwtape
Whats wrong wit’ you? You all been out of shape
Sopping like your moms wit’ you
‘Cause I wouldn’t do a song wit’ you? Poor slut
More stuff, still rapping
How can I call you a has been, you never have been?
The most wanted, most boast, but don’t want it
The flows rugged, please know I’m cold blooded



[Verse 1]
Allow me to set the scene first
This little nigga no older than seventeen in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walkin' down the mean murk, where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt’ll find a nigga
Even if you tryna' get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smirk, he smiled back
He remembered this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialed back
How niggas do, he kept it movin', couldn’t wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn’t wait to get shown
Straight A’s as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he’d get her out for good
That made him smile
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn’t wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn’t wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon' save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he’s fading out, the favorite child
He’s fading out (the favorite child)



[Verse]
Imma blow up on you niggas
I just wish it would happen quicker I figured
When I get richer then I'll be the winner
Shoutout to my believers imma deliver
I got a couple things I wanna get off my chest
I care too much of what you think of me
I write these rhymes in secrecy
Cause niggas never hear when I’m rapping at a new frequency
It puts me in a deep ravine
I promise half the niggas already skipped this track cause they wanna listen to machinery
They programmed to be trapping
They programmed to be rapping about nothing other than smoking dope and busting and capping
And I swear that imma do something about it when I blow
I got so many rhymes like this that I done wrote
Most of em deleted now cause they wasn't lit enough for the crowd they wasn't about smoking loud
No shooting niggas for the clout
RIP to x I would make a song about em but there’s nothing that I can fix ain't big enough imma kick back
And relax and stick to the script
And do whatever I can to get some more clicks
I swear that one day imma change the game
I refuse to die before our music ain't the same
Niggas had a voice in rap that was our biggest hope
And now the crackers transformed it into a hole of dope and guns they focus on the negative now the hope is gone I hope this song will reach you
I put my heart and soul in this track I'm hoping you hear me
I put my heart and soul in this track I'm hoping you hear me
I put my heart and soul in this track I'm hoping you hear me
I put my heart and soul in this track and none of you hear me



[Intro]
Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas (Live forever)
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point, game tight)
There we go yeah, turn me up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of Hip-Hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derrière
Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heaven's stairs
Or walk inside Hell's dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga that thought Good Kid gon' flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
Y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we ain't have it all
Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
And I'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick
Thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
This is my life and I look at it like its my last
And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don't even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I don't even drink like I used too, and I don't even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab
Lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won't say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dump'n out the roof



[Intro]
(Coast to Coast Instrumentals)
I don't know what the hell that is
Should have just called Puff for the fucking instrumental
Fuck it, no time for that boy!
Cole World

[Verse 1]
They say we living in troubled times
Aye, do you see the trouble signs?
Aye, lifes a bitch, and I'm cuffing mines
My dough in flipmode, what up to Busta Rhymes
I used to never see green, I was colorblind
Now I get my hustle on
Pay dues like a hair salon
My way like a Usher song
Higher power where these verses from
You niggas hoes, put your purses on
Church, get your worship on
Born alone, work alone, die alone
Hot fire like Dylan
Bitches get their dial on
Fake niggas get dial tones
I ain't no Viacom nigga
I'm a fire arm, nigga
Look how I alarm niggas
Watch my dope pile on
'Til it's like a mile long
Niggas couldn't fill my shoes
Couldn't even try 'em on
Showed your lil' ass look
That's how you take it
Two-facing niggas, couldn't tie my shoe laces, boy!

[Verse 2]
That was the warm up, this is the blow up
Now if you ain't talking no bread boy, ain't no need to show up
Man they say I'm repping the Ville too much, but fuck it, so what?
When my niggas carrying toys like they don't wanna grow up
When my sisters drinking like fishes and won't even throw up
Let's po' up, get to' up, know the police gon' show up
I slow up
Some niggas ain't got no luck
Some niggas can't get no love
Some of 'em can't get no bucks
So tell me what do a nigga do if he can't get a job?
My brother got him an interview, but he can't get a ride
What's up God?
No this ain't no Wu-Tang shit
This is my lil' fire drill, just some routine shit
Just to shoot fiends with
And hold 'em off a lil' longer
Every verse I write I swear I'm only getting stronger
Can you ponder?
Imagine what my shit gon' sound like
If I told you that The Warm Up was just a sound bite
Damn right, believe I put it down right
And I'll be sure to tell you lil' niggas what that crown like
I showed you love, I brought you through
I gave you pounds right?
Aye, in my face, you knew your place
And so you smile right?
So why I'm here, and now you talking like a little girl?
You sound like Whitley, nigga
Me? I'm from a different world
Your shit is garbage
If I drop you, I'm a litterbug
Busy getting money
I ain't fucking with that Twitter, girl
Fuck what they say, wishing me harm and sorrow
They here today, bet they be gone tomorrow
They catching Z's on me, aye we gon' call 'em Zorro
I'll let you sleep today, but it's on tomorrow
Yeah, I said it's on tomorrow
I'm coming for the game
And I ain't talking loan or borrow
Pray for the days I get cash, checks and never weary
This the last stretch, I'm a half step from legendary



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah
Oh
(You good, T-Minus?)
Oh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I’ll run through
Two texts, no reply, that’s when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like 11 birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I’ll run through
Two texts, no reply, that’s when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)
Up north, down south, Bankhead to Rachel Walk (Ayy)
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal cord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter (Let's go)
I'ma run the compound (Yeah)
I supply the cigarettes and bread (Woo)
I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb, so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Did your mama tell you when something on fire
Stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start
And we leave them on the cement (Grra, grra)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I’ll run through
Two texts, no reply, that’s when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I, crash down, we get money (Hey)
For the full town (Woah, when you won't play, I)
I decided, for the full side (Hoes will say)
And they know, I might (And fly, I...)
Get down, might (Don't play)
See the whole town every time, I... (Oh, every day)
Yeah, they know what's up (Folks will say)



[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
Ain't no bad time when you run one (Yeah)
It'd make bank if you undo
Better break it down to find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
Hand it down, hit me when you undo
Hand it back, hit it when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)

2003, came to this Earth, to take the crown
I know was destined for this, since all I listened to
Was Eminem, Nas, and Pac, in my old house
After all the shit I've been through one thing I've tried
To figure out, is the game, something I should be in?
Should I want to destroy niggas, for dissing me
On the gram, when they still at home spitting freestyles
While doing dishes, but I just look like a hypocrite
Don't I, that's what every nigga said
That I'm stealing niggas flows, and I'm making it my own
When I birthed my own style, from ICP, and Cypress Hill
And Eminem, Tech N9ne, Twista, Twisted Insane
Fuck the fame, I think I've explained how good I am
In this game, but let me discuss something
This game is like a pornstar getting fucked
Cause as soon as a rappers song on the board
The bullshit will come, and they bragging and screaming
How they have many songs on it, when I have never seen
This nigga spit something that's not having to do
With screaming and bragging, and I know fans
Get mad, because they favorite rapper be trash
And I just give a opinion, but they majority blocks it out
But when I'm trying to explain to these rappers
That yes, they suck, they wanna go
And make diss records, and go viral, the fuck
This game is fulled of missing puzzles for real
That or a piece of these rappers brains, got eaten by eels
At this point, these rappers are either retarded or dumb
If 4 mil on a house, don't show you, then you really be done
You made it out ya momma house, from slanging rocks
Near the black top, when in reality, you didn't sell shit
You just talk about it for clout stocks, and fuck clout
This generation is some queers, honestly I have the balls
To make these rappers disappear, for real
But I noticed something about this year
It only took a year for Soundcloud rap, to be on radio
For everyone to hear, but I'm not impressed
By how they really going about fame, taking it
And claiming at as there game, for they own gain
But the bread you collecting, ain't bringing nothing to ya name
But beef that you can't settle, and fighting with jewelers
Over chains, so you yell over the gram, staple of the evil
Doing the dumbest shit, while claiming that "I kill people!"
I know one thing niggas will have a question about
Who this going against, what's the anger about?
Since last year, I've thought about it, and ended up thinking
That these rappers might as well pay me
Cause all of em, are some bitches, fuck rap!

[Outro]
This game sucks
Fuck it...
Welcome to Xcalibur, I'm a take you on a ride



[Produced by Nervous Reck]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
At the stop sign, I looked both ways, pumpin' Ojays
My pops put me on that, catchin' a contact
And weed blew from the backseat, two niggas I just met
A month ago, I'm starin' in the rearview, suspect
I catch a screwface from one of them two-faced niggas
I'm wonderin' how these two snakes ever snuck in my crew
Wait, they knew Filthy, now these clowns in the back of my ride
But I ain't mention Nervous on the passenger side
He tipsy yellin', "Yo my 10 G's in the trunk plus yours
I know you young but this the most dough you've seen thus far"
I tried to smile but barely did, I glanced in the backseat
Feelin' like these cats got plans to attack me
But maybe that's weed smoke makin' me  so
Paranoid of some snakes, Nervous asked me was I straight
Said it's written on my face, what was up?
Eyes motioned to the back, I said "nothin' much"
I turned the CD up, a coincidence, Ojays, backstabbers
I laughed at the irony, them niggas still eyein' me
It must have been the alcohol cause suddenly I shouted
"Y'all know this is your favorite song, what the fuck you poutin' for?"
Nervous told me chill out, them niggas just smiled
One turned to his man, started whisperin' loud
I couldn't tell what he was sayin' though
I turned around and said "You got somethin' to say, then say it, ho"
And before I knew it, mad movement, both them niggas popped out gats
Reply "pull the fuck over, nigga, how 'bout that?"
Fuck man I knew these niggas was some fake ass vests
Couldn't trust as far as I could smell their stank ass breath
I pulled over to the side, looked at Nervous
I guess he sobered up, they told us open the trunk and get out slowly
Said "let me see your hands, show me
And if you make a move for your weapon, it's over, homie"
I wished we had one but wasn't packin'
Bad mistake as this nigga pistol whipped my face and I ate pavement
Grabbed the cash out the trunk, hopped in the front
Me and Nervous helpless as [?]
We just stood there, shocked, pride hurt, plus our pockets
Told Nervous, "Time to mobilize", he looked at me and nodded
Yeah, pride hurt, plus our pockets
Told Nervous, "Time to mobilize", he looked at me and nodded

[Verse 2: Nervous Reck]
Fuck it, yo, that 20 ain't shit, are you aiight?
Wipe that blood off, here's a handkerchief, you livin' the life
Of a criminal now, I should have never brought you 'round
I should have never let you drive the car, I should have held you down
Cause I know you got a temper, you say what's on your mind
They was blowin' smoke up in your face, plus they tried to pry
Up in our business, I can't believe it totally went wrong
But I ain't tryna blame you, I know this shit's my fault
See that 20 up in the trunk, it wasn't from a show
I lied, I was supposed to off these cats on the low
And I was gonna tell you but I ain't want you to know
Cause in order to do it right, we had to get close
So I figured the best way, take 'em out to get tipsy
Let 'em smoke somethin', I thought takin' you with me would
Give you a hands on look at my profession
It's the underworld, the only way that I relieve aggression
And you told me before that you was interested in it
Been a minute, I've been watchin' you grow into a menace
I know you mad lost, don't mean to speak like this
That bastard must have found a heat tucked underneath my shit
And when he saw the opportunity he couldn't let it pass
Fuck, I can't blame him, yo he caught me slippin' bad
But we 'bout to get it back and I'ma tell you how
Call Bobby, tell him meet us right now, it's goin' down
See I left the tank on E, they ain't gettin' more than 5 to 10 miles
Up the street, so tell 'em bring the heat
Drove off in that direction, 5 minutes later
Seen 'em stalled past the intersection, what a relief
It all happened, we made it look like a car jackin'
Grabbed the bags out the back and you don't want beef
It all happened, we made it look like a car jackin'
Grabbed the bags out the back and you don't want beef



[Hook]
La la la la laaah
They ain't got nothing on me
Hey hey
La la la la la la la
They ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 1]
The lil engine that could
This lil nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good
Cause homie I’ve been ill
Since Hilfiger was hood (ha-ha remember that? Hilfiger cargoes’)
Won't admit it but if you was a real nigga you would
And now I got your chick nigga
She'll get out the hood
And no I would peck her but she peck on my wood
And she do it so good
I gotta thank her
I got her ass clapping that’s how I congratulate her
She like to roll the dro up in the bed go higher
Pepsi cola Michael Jackson and her head so fire
I love this lil redbone Maya
She be getting louder than a set of Dr Dre head phones try her
If you ever need her
She got a man that don't never see her
And when his phone ring he looking like "this better be her"
This unrelated but I wish I could have met Aaliyah
And when I get to heaven, homie I better see her
But what you think it's really like behind the pearly gates
No murder rates all the bad shit we heard of race
And can we still do the fun shit we did love and if so
Then do you think some angels work in strip clubs
Well if so I be trying to get my dick rubbed
Make it rain filling up their tip cups
Throwing ones...

[Bridge]
Yeah nigga I'm the one
(Hey hey)
Say I’m the one
Yeah boy I'm the one
Hey yeah
Now I'm the one thus meaning no one must try
No two no three no four, no why?
Cause I'm the one
Yeah nigga I'm the one

[Verse 2]
Now every nigga keep talking keep walking
This the Ville where the real killers don’t speak often
But leave you leaking on the concrete police talking
My flow Nieman Marcus
You're so flea market so don't be starting cause Cole retarded
I be shitting on my niggas and my dough be farting
They won’t even say excuse me
Usually the groupies don't amuse me
Just wanna say I rate the tape my paper my loosely(?)
But can I take a lil dip in your Jacuzzi
Now I ain't Biggie but I got you feeling +Juicy+
Ohh she feeling like she never before
I bet she never forget me like an elephant won't
And yeah my name J.Cole I got a hell of a flow
I guarantee I'm gon sell em if you ever been poor
Or if you're trying to be rich
And this economy shhh if anything making money man
It’s probably this
Boy I'm the one...

[Bridge]
[Hook]

[Third Verse]
The lil engine that could
This lil nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good
A couple of yall ain't took a field trip to the hood
Ay me I'm Fresh Prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood Baby!
Ain't sayin names but we not the same
All that money and the fame don’t change the fact that u lame
Might wanna grab you a chain wanna tip up your hat
Might wanna purchase some game homie your shit is so wack!!!
I got my finger on the trigger tell that nigga hold datt
Boy I’m picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I’m young black get to live my life on the run!
Bet ya bottom dollar before I’m done
They say that I’m the one
Yeah nigga I’m the one HA!!

[Bridge]



[Intro: Jerry Seinfeld & George Costanza]
Oh so there's still hope?
I don't want hope, hope is killing me
My dream is to become hopeless
When you're hopeless, you don't care
And when you don't care, that indifference
It makes you attractive

[Verse 1: Wale]
Uh, a nigga feelin' hopeless
Uh, who am I to change perception?
If a nigga kill a nigga he's another statistic
If his skin's a little different, they gon' say it was self-defense
Nigga feelin' hopeless
Uh, starin' at the idiot box, riddle me this
If a killer was a nigga would niggas still really care
Cause niggas worser than Zimmerman livin' life everywhere
Niggas hopeless
Small niggas with big tools
Couldn't get to Harvard, hard work, he hard whipped
Cause them hardy har's and hard nights are hard to live through
When you hopeless
What we gotta do to be winnin'? Cause all the schools gettin' closed
Dribble a little, coach shootin' at a foe
Cause they chargin' them to hoop at community center
My nigga hopeless
25 bands he was shootin', not a damn givin'
Cousin threw a couple grand at some dancers
Throwin' back their fat ass, is my glasses confused?
We're the hopeless
America's dream and nightmare in the same being
Even when being polite here
Niggas try to bring me down, the life of a pioneer
Lightyears worth of hopeless
Celebrity celebrating disgusts me
The cerebellum invaded with all these fresh things on
Watchin' "Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta" as we speak
Nigga we hopeless
Okay, the Steebie show is on
And so my broad rollin' weed now she's mad at me
Cause she seen a scene with Rasheeda baby father
Said, "You niggas all hopeless"

[Hook: J. Cole]
Got a pocket full of lint again but it make no difference to me
Fallin' out with my friends again but it make no difference to me
Goddamn I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Aw man, I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Got no gas in my tank again but it make no difference to me
Overdraft at the bank again but it make no difference to me
Goddamn I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Lord knows I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, still I pray

[Verse 2: Wale]
Nigga feelin' hopeless
Like a penny with a hole in it
We as empty as a corazón of a widow
From a soul that she don't know when he's comin' home
He don't got no limit, hopeless
What's a purple heart to a hurt head?
He done done 12 years, he was told 6
Prolly go back in a minute, ain't shit here
Nigga so hopeless
Thoughts are ravaging in the whole crib
Now he post-traumatic and always on the edge
On the pills, some bills, two kids, one leg
Nigga so hopeless
A lot of black cops always clap back
And some foul white cops always on deck
Playin' race card, guarantee you'll make a blackjack
Nigga so hopeless
Cause we ain't 'posed to never have shit
And we ain't vocalise rap
Niggas cause we don't promote unless we drop hits
Nigga hopeless
Look, look at what I go through to show you
Niggas respect money, money respect power
And power, we never given unless a nigga catch, shoot or dribble
We are hopeless
Nah, you ain't out here for the culture
You finna riot, without a purpose
You ain't a mothafuckin' rider, you a fuckin' token, posin'
Nigga hopeless, of course not literal
But why complain about The Man when a nigga want my skin?
The same problems with them I had is out there killin' niggas too
Eat your food, nigga...
A nigga feeling hopeless

[Hook: J. Cole]
Got a pocket full of lint again but it make no difference to me
Fallin' out with my friends again but it make no difference to me
Goddamn I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Aw man, I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Got no gas in my tank again but it make no difference to me
Overdraft at the bank again but it make no difference to me
Goddamn I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Lord knows I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, still I pray



[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Verse 1]
Feel like I lived for this moment
I see it in their eyes, them other guys don't want it
My style they can crown it, but can't dethrone it
I was aiming for the top and now I I I'm on it
What a powerful performance
I was in my zone, send flowers for opponents
Tell 'em "Get well soon"
Cause I ain't in the mood
So if you read that word backwards then it should spell 'doom'
I'm on fire, y'all can inhale fumes, as I zoom by ya
As you thinking, 'Who's higher?'
Fueled by a desire you should admire
That's why I'm what they aspire to be 'fore they retire
A livin' legend, with God givin' blessings
And game so cold they probably watching this in Heaven
Expecting the incredible, so baby watch me do that
And make the Angels say 'Lord, how he do that?'

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try

One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Verse 2]
A champion's mentality
And so I'm scoring, ignoring the fact you're fouling me
And one, where I go you can't come
I was schooling your father boy, that make you my grandson
I've been around the block twice, now my shot nice
No referee but best believe out here I got stripes
Now that they finally consider me a legit scorer
Would you believe I started off as a bench-warmer?
Have me feelin' like Master Splinter
Now the haters and commentators say 'there's a winner'
Hey, hard work pay off, now I don't take a day off
I rest not, I guess that's why your best shot? Way off
These are the things that dreams are made of
The sweep, no time for sleep, when you're elite
If what you reap is what you sow, then what was you expecting?
Expect to come in second
While I become a legend

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Outro]
Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here
I guess I'll see you when you get here

Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here
I guess I'll see you when you get here

[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply



[Intro: J Cole.]
Yeah yeah yeah. Therapist, uh yeah, check it yo. What's the reasons? Yeah, hey, yo listen. Not yet, yeah yeah. Fayettnam forever, listen yo yo yo hey

[Verse 1: J Cole}
I lean back like the incense and relax
Well try to relax, but gotta be ready to react
To anything, many things, anyone
When it comes to drama i done seen plenty dawg ain't even 21
Remember counting pennies up as a bright kid
Now I'm dreaming to put my mother up in a nice crib
But we all on this wild goose chase for big checks
You hate and disrespect, and I ain't even rich yet
Imagine when I'll be there, beware
For these nigga's that so broke, that there's no hope for repair
And prepare for these stares, iced grills don't ever be scared
They breathe air just like you, gotta see clear cause
Money will blind you shit in front of your eyes
You will see it all, until you ain't breathing dawg
Cause then it's too late, i must say, im trying to stay on earth
I pray to god, he told me "Yo you gotta stay alert to stay alive"

[Outro:Bobwire]
Yo you best believe we out here grinding motherfuckers
This ain't no joke, save the party and bullshit for later
Right now we trying to make this paper
Chicago PA, DT, BA, Maryland and DC
Niggas out here trying to hussle and all terrains gonna eat



My man Shawn
From around the way



[Verse 1]
My man, Shawn, from around the way, son, been down from day one
Never been known for mistakes but was bound to make one
Her name was Nina, see he was all about the cash flow
Til she came and had this man pussy whipped to the max yo
A true dime piece describin her, brown eyes
Caramel skin, thick thighs, goes beyond speech
But besides looks her mind's lost
Known for kickin cats to the curb, leaving their hearts on the sidewalk
Shawn was one of them, she said she was lovin him
But only fucked him because he had some funds comin in
He couldn't see it though
She was cheating and he didn't even know
He even bought a crib with this schemin ho
In the ride, mad jewels, mad clothes, mad shoes
And to show his commitment he got her name tattooed
I gotta hand it to her, she had the stuff planned out
But watch what happened when her luck ran out

[Hook]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm
[x2]

[Verse 2]
Time passes, Shawn is thinking about wedding rings
But he knows the signs of cheating and doesn't wanna believe them
He disregards them, goes out for diamond ring shopping
Now the big question is when is he gonna pop it
Waiting for the right time
Meanwhile Nina's the same ho
Like a snare drum but bangs way more
For Shawn up to this point shit's going well
Til one day his homeboy hit him on his cell, like
"Yo son you won't believe this, I just seen your chick." ("Where?")
"In the mall with this cat, he was palming her ass
I swear to God son. Need me to run up on him and drop him?"
"Nah, chill I got this, I'll hit you back if it's poppin"
He hung up, I called Nina, "Where you at? What you doing?"
"At the mall with some friends buying new Timbs."
Somethin sounded funny
She was lying for sure
But Shawn had a little plot of his own
Check it

[Hook x2]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm

[Verse 3]
I missed you (Aw)
Missed you so bad I followed you (What, where?)
Followed you all the way to your boyfriend's rendevouz (What?)
Yeah bitch you caught now
So don't even try to give me that shit you thought how it wasn't you who I saw now (No it wasn't)
You trifling ho, I gave my whole life to you yo
And now you basically shove a knife in my throat (It's not like that)
But it's alright though, the same cat you was fucking with then
Is currently laying dead in the trunk of my Benz (Oh God)
Yeah get to crying, in a minute you'll be there beside him
And by the time the cops find you I'll be in the islands (No, I'm sorry)
Visualizin what could have been between me and you
It was just just a dream, you fucked up the thing between us two
So now it's speak your peace before you leave this earth bitch (We can work this out)
I hope that shit was worth it
And now I pray that God is merciless
With this said, goodbye to the reason I lived this life (Shawn)
Pointed the gat to her mouth, long kiss goodnight (No)

[Hook x2]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: J Cole]
And you know it don't stop, grindin' 'round that clock
Masterminding my second album, my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down, niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops
And we still duckin' cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot
'Cause that score up on the play clock show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you – ASAP; but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop
Get a grip!

[Pre-Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Chorus: J Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world, twice to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Young Krizzle
Shawty look what we got, my bass beat and it knock
Got the old school in my old school was to post up on yo block
Yo broad chose like she was s'posed to and you up in arms 'cause she bopped
Cole I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin' doors on they drop
Y'all niggas too young to remember how to the south used to be but I'm not
So when it come to snappin', Cadillacs, SpottieOttieDopaliscious, y'all pop
You thought Krit Wuz Here and R4 were the shit? Bitch, wait 'til my album drop

[Pre-Chorus 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Say that's yo new car? Nigga that's my old slab
Say that's yo new bitch? Nigga that's my old stab
Oh that's yo new flow? That shit sound so trash
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Hol' up...but don't forget about Compton, nigga!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row
That means I been 'bout it 'bout it and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh
Bitch I'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me take it
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch ain't no challenge
Ain't it?

[Chorus: J Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world, twice to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah things change, things change
Things change nigga

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Pick up the pen, time to write my sins away
Right my wrongs and then life goes on
Bitches be calling, then mistakenly niggas be falling
I fuck them and I leave them, forever picture me balling
With cash that I never had, I'm trying to stretch a million
Hoping it forever lasts, a fear of going broke
Cause most niggas I know can barely make the car note
Can barely keep the rent paid, so I'm like Da Vinci
Painting pictures to last centuries since like the 10th grade
Carolina nigga with New York plates
My template, switch states and swerve, mixtapes was served
Get cake, absurd, and has big plates, preferred
You heard, my every word
Potentially could free us all, now that's a heavy burden
Sometimes I'd rather get some head and watch my wealth grow
Cause things change, am I the same one you fell for?
One side screaming "hell no" other side holding on for dear life
Lately nigga I feel like, I ain't that young frail nigga that I used to be
Pardon my ways girl, I'm still getting used to me
Cause things change, I'm still getting used to me
I ain't that old shy nigga that I used to be
Bitches watching niggas plotting on me, truthfully
Gotta be careful what you wish for, as you can see
Things change

[Hook: T.S. Desandies, Yolanda Renée (J. Cole)]
Things change, it'll never be the same
I've never been the one to settle, it'll never be the same
(Yeah, things change)
Nothing ever stays the same, it'll never be the same
(Things change)
Nothing ever stays the same

[Verse 2: Omen]
I told you, raindrops do fall
But see, these clouds ain't the same that you saw
My memory banks got some pain to withdraw
I am not afraid, I am not unscathed and
Don't use bandaids but, back in the days I was stressing a grip
The only black in my class wondering, where do I sit?
College campus too fast, now depression exists
Like I'm less than equipped, feeling destined to quit
Then you appeared, made me see myself without a mirror
See, I never shared all the fears of my peers
I'm thinking about this African queen, loved her body
But she's more than just the back of her jeans, she's a magical dream
I felll hard with such a frail heart
She taught me that Allah was just her way to spell God
And she was my American pie, so cultured
Her intelligence ahead of her time, looked at my face
And with a smile called me Elephant Eyes, a secret nickname
Always seems to settle my mind, cause I guess it reminds me of you
Which reminds me of love, which reminds me of truth
Which is all the above, recently liquors in my body, it's all on my tongue
I changed into something they thought I'd  never become
Give you my food for thought, it's more than a plate of soul food
If you wanna change, gotta escape your own rules
Things change nigga

[Hook: T.S. Desandies,Yolanda Renée (J. Cole)]
Things change, it'll never be the same
I've never been the one to settle, it'll never be the same
(Yeah, things change)
Nothing ever stays the same, it'll never be the same
(Things change)
Nothing ever stays the same
(Things change baby)
Hey



[Verse 1: Erica Bryan]
I see your shadow, painted on the walls
I hear your echo down the hall
Our pictures whisper, I hear them callin me
Cryin' out for the ghost of what we used to be

[Chorus: Erica Bryan]
This house is haunted
I can feel you all around
You're all I wanted
And now I can get you out
You keep showin up
Everything that I touch
Has your memory on it
Ooo this house is haunted

[Verse 2: Erica Bryan]
I go to bed, sleepin in your shirt again
I feel you wrapped around my skin
The sweetest kisses, they find me in my sleep
I wake up and I swear I feel you next to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Erica Bryan]
Baby don't you know when you go you never really go
We all leave little pieces of our soul
I bet you know....

[Chorus]



[Verse 1: Melanie Fiona]
If only you knew all the love I had inside
If only I told you
That you were my greatest pride
If only I showed you just how good you made me feel
Maybe I wouldn’t be alone and you would be right here but
I don’t wanna do it over
The first time has gone away
You can’t rewind the past
All I can do is say

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m doing much better
Love you like I never
Ever loved you before
Oh baby, not this time
I’m giving my heart and soul
That I reach out for my love
If you say yes I’ll give you my best
This time

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m gonna be stronger
This time I’ll do it all the way
This time I’ll be a better woman
This time I won’t get in my own way
I could go back you never would have gone
If I knew then what I know now
I’ve told you all that I’ve built for you in my heart
In my head I know what I should’ve said
I know what I shoulda did
But I don’t wanna do it over
The first time is gone away
You can’t revive the past
All I can do is say

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m doing much better
Love you like I never
Ever loved you before
Oh baby, not this time
I’m giving my heart and soul
That I reach out for my love
If you say yes I’ll give you my best
This time

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
If looks kill then Melanie you a felony
We both hot I guess we couldn’t take the jealousy
All in my ear I had my homeboys telling me
How to be a player, we fell off like Bill Bellamy
MTV shhh, we used to watch Law and Order, NBC shh
But now I’m watching solo on some empty seat shit
Thinking of you, I got a lot more drinking to do
Reminiscing, though I seen it coming
Yeah I had a premonition
Right beside each other and somehow it felt distant
Lets rewind back when days sunny like Liston
Smile just glisten, your booty like a cushion
Is this the moment where we making up
And realise we tripping forever breaking up
And then I break you off, put you to sleep
Know its deep when the girl of his dreams is the same one to wake him up

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m doing much better
Love you like I never
Ever loved you before
Oh baby, not this time
I’m giving my heart and soul
That I reach out for my love
If you say yes I’ll give you my best
This time

Instant pancakes in the morning
Aunt Jemima try to Andre Benjamin me
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, but your daughter do dicks
Wouldn't be my old bitch if you taught her new tricks
But she do do the one thing, with her tongue ring
When she bust like a gun range
I had a couple pics, record her out her panties
But, that's just chump change
She the type of bitch that loves to say she's mixed
But when she say the roster she always say "Black last"
You know who you is and you know what it is
I love you with your black ass
You helpless thing, wish you gave me more head
And have way more self esteem
But I wish she gave me way more head
Way more then I ever gave a fuck about your self esteem

I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the Ville
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill
Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third
My shit in every street, like the curb
So bitches wanna meet cause I'm deep with my words
So them niggas wanna peep like a Perv
But peep game
Before they start saying "He changed"
A real nigga can never forget where he came
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train
I throw it up!
Yeah

[Chorus]
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yeah)

Real niggas want the money, so that's where my aim is

Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)
But that's the price when you nice with it
And them ladies gonna like cause you light-skinned
I take advantage of the situation
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania
They catch feelings and I switch next
"I made it clear baby, just sex
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed! "
Even them white girls tryna be my princess
But I only fuck with sisters like incest
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press
I sense death in the air, but it's nothing for me
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that chick
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch
You better hit up homicide, I just killed that shit, boy!

Laying in my bed hope to lay a niggas egg, No- you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign, when it's crime
And the gats flyin up in Gotham, watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop em
Watch 'em better leave 'em alone (Malone) like Stockton, when he retired
Shit your shit is fire boy stop
I don't buy it, boycott, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants-ha!
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up
That's cold blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here you can make if from heaven to hell
I'm just a little nigga strait out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blew, with more rhymes due
Nigga you tryning who?
Sheeit, nigga you tryning me, bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Look, it's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's no time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
It's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch it's no time to chill nigga! Yep



[Verse 1]
I'm try watch my mouth, I already know what it is
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I thinked about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material things I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villians?
Knowing they killin’
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Verse 2]
C.R.E.A.M get the money, dollar dollar billion
Cash rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
Everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money dollar dollar
Look hey
I'mma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I pay dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though I'm never going back
I said I'm never going back No!

[Verse 3]
Look kid, its raining outside boy
F--- an umbrella, man they banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And f--- policing, they killing brothers what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, boy I’ve been real
Westwood I said I've been real



[Intro: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
I don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
(And all in thrilling, new, living sound)
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low damn(take out)
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit? Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claimin' they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day one, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her but she ain't slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow, it's lights out, TKO



Its hilarious
They make me sick, malaria
All up in my area
Bi*ch i ain't scared of ya
Call me weak all you want
Im still way ahead of ya
I will still be around when your freinds thinkin dead of ya
The day i make it
Swear ill forget it all
If i keep on thinkin about it
Itll prolly make me fall
But i won't let that happen
Swear i will have a ball
And if i keep workin hard
One day ill have it all
And i ain't talkin about cash
Not even talkin bout the cash
Not even the case
And i dont want a bad bi*ch
So get the fu*ck out my face
Im trapped in this place
They won give me no space
I try to inhale and breathe
And i start up a chase
Im gettin close to the gates
I can feel it in my soul
So i gots to rebel
And tell em all that its on
Gettin calls from god
I can here the ringtone
But i miseed tht call
And received a text
Sayin its all for the best
So keep on grindin
And be expecting a test
Oh and one more thing never strive for the less
Competition is feirce
But dont shed no tears
Just work for some years
Itl come to your ears
And it will open your eyes
And show you the prize
And i know that you know that i speak no lies
Just listen to me and you will reach the sky

Verse 2
And tonight
I will say goodbye
To anyone that ever hated
Tryna have a goodtime
I will shine
How could i not
Ill reach the top
With all i got chasin my dream
Like a cop chasen kids with marijuana
Yes i am sober but i can get higher than i stoner
Smoken of my bars i hit it hard
Off my gaurd
Oh my lord
Off the charts
Im a star
Must get far
Workin hard
You think you know it all
Boa sit down
Wit ya dumbass ego
Actin like a dumbass clown
You jus arrogant
Thinkin that you run this town
Talkin shit about rappers to make yourself look better
Thats pathetic
Better yet sympathetic
I feel sorry for you
Boa i wish i was a medic
Cus clearly you are sick
Infected with jealousy
Creating your enemies
With ridiculous tendency
Strong than hennessy
I refuse to be shot down
Without a strong quick burn to the stomach
Shoot me all you want i will feel nothin from it
Tulani boa soul rebel
I will never plummet'gun it
I love it
Keep it 100
Keep it dont shun it
Open dont shut it
I feed off of love hate will only make me vomit
They feed off of hate and im wishen they would stop it

[Verse 1]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn’t buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man, that's just life that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with cupid
He beat you and you went back, who's officially stupid?
Oh yeah I understand that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
Cole

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Time to save the world, bearing the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know, so many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes, but I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path, I know my heart will guide me back

[Verse 2]
Yea, man, is this too deep for the intro? If so I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and mothafuckers that hated school
Said "that's for busters," then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy starin' out my blinds
Till I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play, pardon me
Whats your name, don’t mistake me for no lame, no not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, even-tu-ally R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that just how its happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot em down

[Interlude]
Ha, yeah nigga
Hell yeah, I felt that one in my fuckin' soul

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere



[Hook (Mertens)]
Life is way too hard
I can't endure
Let's do this from start
I say no more

[Verse 1 (Mertens)]
When I grow up I want to ball like Jordan and LeBron
They say this is my end but homie I've just begun
You should fight for the things that you're believing in
But sometimes you should accept that things are harder than you think
Soon you're old and you regret missed opportunities
But new chances will appear in new communities
So my advice to everyone is don't ever give up
As soon as you started something you should never stop
One thing you can be sure of is that nothing's ever sure
But when you'll reckon that, life may be easier than before
Majority of the people in your life will come and go
So be careful about what you want to tell and show

[Hook (Mertens)]
Life is way too hard
I can't endure
Let's do this from start
I say no more

[Verse 2 (J. Cole)]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block
Man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way

[Hook (Mertens)]
Life is way too hard
I can't endure
Let's do this from start
I say no more



[Instrumental Refrain]
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute (oh yeah)
Do it
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
First order of business, I gotta fly out my people
Way too many fakes in my face, I can see the evils
Drug addictions, bad bitches
They gotta be chose, see the peacoat
Black slacks, it's R.I.P. clothes, see amigos
Laid back, I cock the nino, game time, gang time
No time to reload, handle mine, take mine
I've gotta deebo, can't waste a minute
Rap Yeats, I master business, but still a menace
Peep my mojo I got together, I'm in my bag
Too many looks, they pocket watchin', gotta hit the gas
Look back, I see the clouds, these niggas doubt
They say a nigga'd never make it, now look at me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hood times, I never cared, I pull up there
Outside your club, I'm at your club (yeah)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
An' I gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
My city never want for nothin' (never want for nothin', ayy)
My city love it when I'm hustlin' (love it when I'm hustlin', ayy)
I flip the merchandise and rotate (I flip the merchandise)
I've been a mogul and I'm heavy (I am an enterprise)
Every time I rep it's with the extras (with the extras)
I be on one, I be zonin', I be flexin' (I be flexin')
This shit gotta be the oil talk (oil talk)
This shit gotta be all your fault (all your fault)
Big body movin' with my name on it (name on it)
Big body, tell me she gon' sing on it (sing on it)
Me, my nigga Hootie, we gon' make a movie (we gon' make a movie)
I got moves to make, officer don't shoot me (officer don't shoot)
California-raised, California-paid, yeah (yeah)
California K's, watch out for the strays, yeah (yeah)
10 toes down, keep it underground, yeah (yeah)
Hoe we ran it then, now we run it now, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Heard niggas got beef
Then they see me on the street, and don't speak
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak
Yeah, I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips
Meanwhile I’m on the strip, putt puttin’ wit ya bitch
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160
Bitch don’t fuck with me, trust nigga I’m sick
Can’t tag me, fuck nigga I’m it—watch this
With my heart on my sleeve I bleed pardon my greed
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity
How can it be I blew up singlehandedly
Nobody handed me shit
Granted though, I planned to be rich
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly
On cameras but won’t holla at family only randomly
After a few drinks come our realest convos
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo’s
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I’m still mulatto
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said “hell if I know,” shit
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming
Name should be Abe Lincoln ‘cause I cannot tell a lie though

[Chorus: Travis Scott]

Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers



[Intro: J. Cole & Bas]
This one's for you
This one's for you
I think I made it

[Chorus: Bas]
I think I made it, I think I made it
'Cause I'm always smiling, and you are the reason now
Girl, I can't explain it
It's all in the timing, I had to get low
I had to get low
I had to get back, I had to report
I had to get facts 'cause you are just that, you that
Girl, you share your truths with me
And I find them true, a muse, you in the booth with me

[Verse 1: Bas]
Can't spend no time on the nickle and dime'n
I got me a girl, she don't want no diamonds
A daily reminder to holla at God
Like "Where did you find her? Good looking, my nigga"
Everything 'round me I took it
Did it with only the niggas I knew
And a few niggas I thought I knew better
There go my bitches, I always do better
But, you're more top echelon
My next probably be a step backwards
Niggas front when they get struck with love
Like the drama majors, be the best actors
I'm done with all that tough acting
John Madden would've saw it happen, and so it happens
My niggas want life's good things, they still dreaming
And you deserve 'em too, I'ma do it just so it happens

[Chorus: Bas]
I think I made it, I think I made it
'Cause I'm always smiling, and you are the reason now
Girl, I can't explain it
It's all in the timing, I had to get low, I had to get low
I had to get back, I had to report
I had to get facts 'cause you are just that, you that
You share your truths with me
And I find them true, a muse, you in the booth with me

[Bridge: J. Cole]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (This one's for you)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (This one's for you)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (I'm hella faded)
La, la, la, la, la (Yeah)
La, la, la, la, la
I'm hella faded, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm hella faded, I'm hella faded
These niggas been hating, I don't know the reason now
Sometimes I feel jaded
They don't see the real me
They only know Cole, they only know Co-ole
I had to get back, I had to resort to turning my back
I'm doing just that, true that
I thought he was through with me, but that wasn't true
The proof? You in the coupe with me
God shuffled the cards, dealt me a hand with impossible odds
Put an obstacle course up
Look, and I conquered them all (Conquered them all)
With minimal effort I'm fresher than sock in your drawer (Fuck)
They spinning my records so heavy, I'm topping the Forbes
Stuck in a rock and a hard place though
Is it true what they say? The higher you go, the longer the fall?
Well, I dropped to the floor, the knock at the door was on cue
Uh, I thought that I saw it all 'til I saw you
Now I call you when the sun shines and the rain dries up
I'm a pit bull, but for you I be on chain tied up (One more time)
In the backyard with a muzzle on tail wagging like Oregon Trail
Waiting on you to come through just like you do, well

[Chorus: Bas & J. Cole]
I think I made it, I think I made it, I think I made it
'Cause I'm always smiling, and you are the reason now
Girl, I can't explain it
It's all in the timing, I had to get low, I had to get low
I had to get back, I had to report
I had to get facts 'cause you are just that, you that
You share your truths with me
And I find them true, a muse, you in the booth with me

[Outro: J. Cole & Bas]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (This one's for you)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (This one's for you)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (This one's for you)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
I think I made it
I think I made it, I think I made it
I think I made it
'Cause I'm always smiling and you are the reason now



[Intro: Rodney Dangerfield & Johnny Carson]
Ah, that's right, doll
But everyone wants love
Love, is the answer, Johnny
Everyone is lookin' for love, deep love
A lifetime of deep love, you know?
I'm lookin' for a shallow half hour, you know?
Don't you have luck with women?
I never had luck with women
I'm no ladies man, I know that, Johnny
And I never got girls when I was a kid in show business either, you know?
One girl told me, "Come on over, there's nobody home"
I went over, there was nobody home!

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You and I will always meet somewhere in between
You and I will always meet somewhere in between
Sweet Trippy, I'm yours for the gettin'
Talkin' foolish at the moon, I was gone, 1800, sippin'
I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it
All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Come meet me in the middle, right there where you always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always be
Come meet me in the middle, right there where we always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always be
Come meet me in the middle (I'll meet you in the middle)
Come meet me in the middle (Somewhere in between)
Come meet me in the middle (You and I will always be)
Right there where we always be (Somewhere in between)

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Without a space I could feel, in the words to define
Pick it up, if you will, heavy weight on my mind
Just a pretty brown thing wit'cho head in the clouds
Why don't you put the round thing in the palm of my hands
Up enough for the thrill, over over you spill
Open up, I could tell
I could see when it's real
And as soon as I grab a hold of ya, I'ma have to let go of ya

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Came down the block, somethin' sick, but it's rented
I don't give a fuck, bitch, either way, I'm in it
I ain't gotta prove to you that I got bread
Niggas talkin' money but be broker than the bed
That I slept on back in Mohammed crib
'Member fuckin' hoes leanin' all to the left?
Don't know why they rock wit' a nigga, but they did
Damn sure wasn't the money, maybe it's the kid?
Used to have a honey that I loved when we was younger but somehow got disconnected before Facebook got so big
I used to search her name hopin' we could reconnect
But if I sent the message, would she still be on my dick?
When I couldn't find her, had me feelin' mad lame
Maybe she got married and she changed her last name
Maybe she just ain't up on the latest of the internet and ain't got into that
But give her time, that'll change
Bingo, what do you know?
Years later, late night after a show we here laid up
Brown skin, love how it glow, your hair tied up
Ask, "Is it cool if I smoke?" Go 'head, light up
High from your fragrance, I love, you smell purrty
Know I got it straight from the mud, my nails dirty
If somehow we both lose touch, I won't lie, ya got me open way too much, I'm gon' find ya

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Sweet trippy, you’re lost in the deep end, like water to a fish scale
Love to watch you swim
I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it
All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Come meet me in the middle, right there where you always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always be
Come meet me in the middle, right there where we always be
Somewhere in between, you and I will always be
Come meet me in the middle (You and I will always be)
Come meet me in the middle (Somewhere in between)
Come meet me in the middle (You and I will always be)
Somewhere in between
You and I will always be

[Refrain]
(I said) Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
(I said) Liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
(I said) Real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
(I said) Gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
(I said)

[Bridge]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Troubles of this, troubles of this world

[Verse 1]
Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say "Live fast, die young," so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard "Can't Get Enough"
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, "The Things Hoes Say"
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

[Hook]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

[Refrain]
Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
(I said) Liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
(I said) Real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
(I said) Gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
(I said)

[Verse 2]
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off of her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like "Don't you know this shit already?
Nigga, ain't you rich already?"
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho
Had a nigga baby, little mans don’t know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
"Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?"
Whoa

[Hook]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

[Refrain]
Set it off on my left, set it off on my right

[Chorus]
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The C.R.E.A.M. is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with

[J. Cole - Verse 1]
Yo, Tasha, a fox but, been round the block cause niggas jock her
The wannabe model she dating mobsters
Been involved with street kids to kingpins
Got a thing for the bad boys
Thats how she meets him, see him is cat named "Black"
Real name Jack James, stacks change
Real big in the crack game
She’s seen that Range and she’s seen that chain
The bling made the dame wanna give up her last name
She was wit, but he was pimp like, just like Ike was
Treated her like it was the Fight Club
Hit her with rights, blood drippin’ on white rug
By the end of the night, they would kiss and she was iced up
Long as he kept her iced up, she piped down
Hit her off with a little pipe to mic bounce
Down south where a nigga wouldn’t return for days or weeks
She was too afraid to cheat
So you ain't even gotta ask
As long as she got a Prada bag
Or an Armani exchange skirt showing a lot of ass
She’s good, living the life, she’s ballin’
Too bad she picked the wrong nigga to get involved with
See the nigga black had problems and enemies
And snake niggas is friends only pretend to be
And cats is out for his head, he caught in some shit
Just watch how Tasha gets tossed in the mix

[Chorus]
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread
The C.R.E.A.M. is better, cake niggas fiend
To get a piece of this American dream
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with

[J. Cole - Verse 2]
Now Black owed money and when it comes to this money, trust me
You can’t tip toe with nobody cause
Niggas will do insane things to get they cream
Won’t even speak, let the bullets explain things
Thats how it is, paybacks a bitch, right?
Especially if you didn’t pay back niggas is sick like
Run up in your crib like “bitch where’s the bread at?”
“You got a week to get it, dont got it, you’ll regret it”
Funny I said it cause Jack’s in the same exact predicament
Got a foot in the grave and still digging it
Owe some niggas money with no intentions of giving it
Them niggas is sending warnings, he isn’t listening
Tomorrow morning they buss in his front door
And a swarm of muthafuckers with guns drawn coming at
On the hunt for Black, Tasha gets smacked
But Jack’s gone a whole week before he gets back but
Niggas is through waiting, they been too patient already
They ain't recieved a fucking penny
So they called a nigga up
Told him if he doesnt get the dough
And give it up n the next 6 hours, his bitch is fucked
But, hold up!
The nigga Black answers with “So What!”
“I gives a fuck, shoot the ho up, still won’t show up”
Hung the phone up, toss it back and she knew
Sorry baby girl, this is what cheddar can do!
(2 silenced gun shots)



؛{قسمت۱:داریوش}؛
باز نور زد تو اتاق صبح شده
مثه اينكه يه شب ديگه گذشت و
داريوش تو روياهاش گم شده
ميزنم صورتمو دستامو آب ميكنم كفشامو پام
سفت ميكنم بندامو ميكنم اخمامو باز
عاشقه يه مسير بيراهه زياد كه پياده توش قدم بزنم
تو روياهام غلت بزنم
انقد به آرزوهام نزديك شم بتونم بشون دست بزنم
و تو روياهام غلت بزنم
بياد اون روزا كه رديفيم پليدى اصلا نبينيم
هرچى مانع جلومون بود پريديم ازش و
همه قوى ايم با تزاى عجيب
يه زندگيه لش و رپى، فقط همين
آره خوب و ساده به راه باشه سور و ساتش
بچه ها باهم جور و با عشق ميخندن
تو يه خونه ى كوچيك و جمع كه هر كسى آرزوشو داره
دور از شلوغيه شهر، دور از ترافيك دور از فساديم
هميشه به راهيم شب سرو راحت رو بالش بزاريم
با لذت بخوابيم، چشه حسودا باشه كور
مايه باشه تو دست، يه همدم واسه شوخياى خركى
خنده هاى الكى پايه باشه اونم، شاهكاره
لم بدم رو چمناى خيس زيره آفتابه داغ
ديگه كسى نگه داريوش يه آشغاله

؛{همخوان}؛
تو روياهام غلت ميزنم
تو روياهام غلت ميزنم
ميبينم روزى كه ميرم بالاتر
ميبينم روزى كه ميرم بالاتر
تو روياهام غلت ميزنم
تو روياهام غلت ميزنم
ميبينم روزى كه ميرم بالاتر
ميبينم روزى كه ميرم بالاتر

؛{قسمت۲: بامداد}؛
جيباى پرم، يه پليسه خوب زمستوناى بلند، روياهاى دورمن
گوره پدره بهشت و فرشته من
اين جهنم و دوس دارم با رخ زشتش
متروهاى پر تا خايه دورم پره آدماى‌ متفاوت
از ديده من اينا باحاله، اين شهر يه چيزايى داره
كه هيچ جاى ديگه توى دنيا نداره
دافا خيلى وقته فقط رفيقه تختمن
از ديده من عشق مسخرس
زندگى به كاره پول اسكناس
طلاى سبز هرچى ميخواى صداش كن، فرقى نداره
من ميگم رويايى كه سير نميشم ازش
وقتى همه صبح پا ميشن اون كه ميخوابه منم
چون يه كارى دارم كه نيمه تموم هميشه
اين يه رويه بامداده كه بيرون هميشه

؛{همخوان}؛

[Intro]
Yeah
Fresh off the mother fucking broadcast
And I'm here, fuego nigga
Yeah, hey, uh, it's happening fast
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
I told niggas on the low, they ain't hear it though
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow
We eating better than we was a few years ago
Sent you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it's mayday
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors
Bill collectors blowing us up, they couldn't fade us
Bitch I made straight A's, go ahead, and try to degrade us, haters
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones
Collecting money, a lesson from me: everybody's got a story dog
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog
With hits like a porno blog
Not hopping out the shower to make ten dollars an hour
Ain't judging though, to each his own
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home
More power to you
But a message to you fuck niggas
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna fuck with you
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new
Same old, fuck it though, what's up with you?
If you made it this far listening without skipping
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?
Yeah that was random man, but so is life
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right
I find myself fiending for a spot to go at night
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life
The unabomber, bitch I'm blowing up overnight (BOOM!)

[Outro]
Hey, yo, it's happening fast
I say it's happening fast
All the drama that I had to get past
Will it last? Or will it pass?
Just as quick as it came
Hoes knowing my name
Dog, welcome to fame
I pray to God we don't change
But even if you don't
Most niggas look at you strange
But I guess I can't complain (Hey)
Hey man it's happening fast
I say it's happening fast
I say it's happening fast



[Verse 1]
They say I'm wicked check the appetite. We ain't half alike
They say that boy Omen a trip. Well I ain't packin' light
I'm somethin' like a raptor like, human sacrifice
When this mic is in my hand, I'm spittin' fire
Got 'em looking like, a candle light
I'm undercover, I'm like Columbo mixed with Sherlock Holmes
That's right, word got home
About your plans and your schemes
Fancy regimes, it's over with
TV full of dumb hoes
And naw I'm not no Overton
So sorry, won't be wife-ing
It seems to me, that only when we dumb is when you love us
Putting us upon your magazine covers
And I know about your history
All about your trickery
Your tendencies
And what your real incentive be
And how you want supremacy
You see I know your number, blow your cover
Detective Omen no problem with being the lonesome gunner
I know you act as if it's blessing you givin'
Food for thought
But I don't really trust this chef in the kitchen

[Hook 1] (2x)
Rolling around the town like a lost Trojan soldier
Appalled at my culture with all this exposure
Tore down our chapels, forbidden fruit and
My teeth in these apples is all on my lawn

[Verse 2]
Yo
Give em poor education
Feed em with degradation
Give em more segregation
That's how we can penetrate them
Condition their mental
This is experimental is far from coincidental
My gun has turned to a pencil
Treat us like a project
So they put us in the projects
Divide and conquer understand
Dissolve this it's to process
Make dumb cool
Then make smart lame
Make em apathetic
Don't matter as long as they entertain
Don't need the KKK
Don't need the CIA
Make em turn on each other
And kill themselves that's how we play
No fingerprints no inconveniences
If they ever trace it back to us then we can plead the fifth
While we eat organic apples
Their neighborhoods is gettin' McDonald's
Forbidden fruit in their stomachs, see it make em unravel
If they're ever keen & aware we make em seem crazy
And it's all going according to plan from what I've seen lately

[Hook] (2x)

[Outro]
On the low, on the low, on the low, did ya know
It's on the low, It's on the low, It's on the low, tell me did ya know
It's on the low, It's on the low, It's on the low, well did ya know
It's on the low, It's on the low, It's on the low, Detective "O"
Yeah



[Intro: DJ Drama]
Baby, I won't tell if you won't tell
I mean, we could keep it on the hush hush
Let me tell you

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I ain't gonna lie, I'm fiending 'cause I need it
And I'm digging you a lot, now you still catching feelings
But I'm feeling on your spots, no kidding when I hit it
I'll be licking on ya spine, playing with your mind
I ain't gonna stop, when I finish I be in it
I be fucking with the lights on, that's the shit that I'm on
Give it all I got, your body and my body

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)

Undercover, cover cover, cover cover
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
One thing you should know about me is I never play to lose, huh
Always aim high and rarely obey the rules
Never tell my business, if I did, it make the news
They say, "Time is like money," you should come and pay your dues
And come kick it, can I get a minute? Maybe an hour, huh
Would you let me peak my head in for a second while you shower? Huh
I bet you got some real good power, if you feel me
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, you know just what's gon' heal me, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover (Undercover shawty)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I said, "Excuse me Mrs. Officer, can you go undercover for me?"
Ain't enough liquor in your cup, the waitress here, then let her pour it up
I'm tryna get you drunk as fuck
Take her to my crib, then I lock her in them handcuffs
Panties off, stupid booty
Ready for war, Call of Duty
She said I got the right to remain silent and
I've got to give it to her rough but I better not get violent, ha
Girl, my chain feel like an anchor
And when I told you to use your head, I ain't want you to be no thinker
And we ain't gon' waste this drink up, these haters sore like cankles
While I'm countin' all this paper and my ears shine like twinkle, twinkle, ha
Big star, get in my car, I don't valet that
You a weak nigga, pussy in the street 'cause you're an alleycat
And I'm loyal to my fans 'cause I love 'em
So girl, if you're a fan, you can meet me undercovers like

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover
Hey shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover, cover cover, cover cover (Undercover shawty)

[Outro: DJ Drama]
DJ Drama. Breezy, Cole World



[Intro: J. Cole]
If you miss me
And you can't find
Me nowhere
I done seen it all, oh my God
Uh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

[Verse 2: Lute]
Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
I reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, "Rip," and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit, nigga)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with



It’s the return of the
“Yeah he sing like a brother
Been flowing like a river
Ever since we can remember

Hitting notes like he Timber
Lake or Prince Rogers Nelson
Turn his ass to a symbol
He only there if we let him”

Never wanted to be any less than a legend
Crush the world in my palm when I’m on
Never forget back to day, Studio A
I was playing my shit for Duro
Demo, Gudwin, and Swivel
Thinkin about them euros

And dreaming of a better life
I swear I’m close enough to taste it
Never waste an opportunity to shine

Cuz when I blow, I swear it’s over
And if I’m on, then best believe that Joe is coming with me
Swear that ya’ll ain’t fuckin with me

I’m screaming Apex for forever and a day
The only competition in this game, just throw the rest away
Can’t even front like this my hardest, locked the best away
Maybe I’ll hit ya’ll on a rainy day

I might not even put this out, yeah I’m just tryna be productive
But even on my B-Sides, I still ain’t nothin to fuck wit
Just wait for all them voicemails, killing everyone you stuck with
I’m coming fast like I bust quick, so keep ya distance cuz you know

The flow impeccable, promise that I’m incredible
Taking your favorite rapper and making sure he regret
The day he ever fuckin touched a mic
And make him pack it up
It’s over homie, wrap it up
I swear I never gave a fuck

And one day you know this gon’ be the anthem
Bumpin all my shit inside the Phantom
Takin all the competition, new edition, old edition
Never miss em, hit em wit, a new beginning
Honda civic, swapped for the Wraith with the windows tinted
God damn

Cole said one day everybody gotta die
But homie, I been feeling so alive
Just wait for the day, that I’m on and killing
I’ve been scheming like a villain, I told ya’ll
Ain’t nobody out that can break my stride
God damn



[Intro: J. Cole]
On that Henny
My tour bus got plenty
I surplus so many
Wanna' serve us so many, Cole
On that Henny
My tour bus got plenty
I surplus so many
Wanna' serve us so many, go

[Verse 1]
Babe, now I do some things I ain't so proud of, wait
Need to get this off my chest so can you stay
But you want me to beg
That ain't playing fair
I won't, won't do that

[Bridge]
Shall we say, I'm still young but grown enough to make mistakes
You're the only one I left in me and my place
If you want an excuse, that's one thing I don't do, no babe

[Hook]
Love you baby, more than my own life
What else can I say if you're not satisfied

[Verse 2]
You be asking me about where I be
Wondering who I see, ain't you here with me
Baby, don't you trip, cause I lost that shit
Fuck them other chicks, but I know you ain't convinced
I tell ya'

[Bridge]
Hey, I'm still young but grown enough to make mistakes
You're the only one I left in me and my place
If you want me excused, that's one thing I don't do, now baby

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, got a vendetta even though I been better
She be out of pocket when her friends wit' her
Disturbing the peace, curse words in the street
Man, shoulda' let the muhfucking Benz hit her
But I chilled though
And peeled off, real slow
Straight face, so she'll know
But damn that thing feels so good, make a nigga do the heel-toe
That's high school shit, baby this a different world
A world where women don't last long
Got so many hoes that I passed on
Leave her heartbroken with a cast on
Learning all the words to the sad songs
I know it seems that my past wrong
And so it seems that I'm past gone
Like one false move and yo ass gone
But you a lil' mo' purty, lil' mo' thick
Lil' mo' smarter, lil' mo' quick
Lil' mo sweeter, lil' mo' slick
Superwoman like Lil' Mo hit
So stop thinking that I'm still gon' dip
I know it might seem weird to you
That sometimes our dreams come true
But sometimes our fears do too

[Hook]

4 inch heels strong
Got three kids
And they dad gone
Pills got the girl
The kill zone
Up in the club
But the kids home
Letting every nigga
Get they feel on
Dollars in the air
State fair
Climbing up a pole like stairs
Slide back down like square
She'on care
In order to use it
She need the music
Momma gave it to her
Her daddy abused it
Eyes wide shut
For the haters
No chaser
No ice
Turn out the lights
This is her life
She already promised
She won't tell nobody
Ain't even for the money
She love everybody
Don't Really like attention
Do it for favor
So even tho it's rains
She don't need ya paper
And that's fucked up
Her mood sucks
And my pockets low
Oh no
It's time to go
Take her to A
B with some friends
Let's see some magic
That all depends
If she want the D
In need for change
She like the ones
I see some 10s
Look at they ass
Really can't pass
What's all the fuss
Come roll with us
I want to touch
This is a rush
Really can't trust
But I need to bust
When I do
Gotta run
Back to getting rich
And please, no phone calls
Stay the fuck off my dick



[Verse]
Hey, to the college kids, no scholarships
Starting your semester
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it’s God bless ya
Life is your professor, know that bitch is gon' test ya
I got some shit I’d like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
And can I spit out my stress?
It’s the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic
He said, "Cole, a lil' birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic”
Nobody touching Nas, nigga it’s more like Villematic
These Fayettenam tales be paying off well
What story is my audio theater gon' tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon' sell?
I guess it’s in God’s hands
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say, "God damn"
That's for your non-believers
I’m the truth only time will teach ya
And fuck the haters, probably never love they mamas neither
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes
With computers on hatin' on the newest song
While you was browsin', I was takin' out them student loans
Trying to do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on
Name a fuckin' song I ain't threw up on
Talk is cheap, it's like y'all grew up in a Jewish home
Pardon the stereotype
But y'all giving me mixed feelings like I married a white woman
One minute I’m overrated, next minute I’m the savior
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
For bullshitting and that nigga Cole spitting that real
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
To Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
Cause now I’m dealing with money I’ve never seen before
And R&B bitches want me, that was just dreams before
Now do I give into the temptation I’m facing
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasing
But I’m just a man, at time’s the timing is wrong
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it’s own
But I’m trying to be strong, remind myself she ain’t about shit
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
Looking for cheese on some mouse shit
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, then go run they mouth quick
Rappers took a vacation I came over to house sit
You want change, this that between the seats in your couch shit
The fuck you thought, I lost it
All that flame on my name would get exhausted
Au contraire my nigga they all ears
Sit back, enjoy the ride it’s finna be a long year, yeah
It’s finna be a long year, yeah

[Outro]
I know you feel that, the tingle in your spine don’t conceal that
Don’t conceal that
This exactly what you thought
Somebody bought the real back



[Hook]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Verse]
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces

[Hook]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Interlude]
My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—
And she say, "clean up"—I say—

[Bridge]
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never

[Hook]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Outro]
I get mad and I slam my door and go in my room—
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"



[Intro: Choir & J. Cole]
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, I swear
It's way darker this time
*Laughs*

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay, faggot?
Uh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch Rap City, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got the game back, and I ain’t ever letting go

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

[Bridge: J. Cole]
My nigga, I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

[Refrain: J. Cole]
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyoncé told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Hey J. Cole, this way, hey
Oh, hey, what's up? What's goin' on with you? Okay
Big smile, man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I

[Bridge: J. Cole, Yolanda DeBerry & Tanikka Myers]
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

[Outro: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner



[Intro]
2-6, Fayettenam
Carolina, Southeast shit
It's a Carolina thing, from the 'Ville to the QC
All my niggas on Bragg, Bunce Road, to The Murk, Greensboro, Bonnie Doone
Eutaw, Winston, Cliffdale, Durham
Cole World

[Verse 1]
Visions of home, the streets that I roam, it’s been awhile
Raise me like the father I never had, I’m still your child
And though I’ve grown in ways that you’ve never known
I’ve ventured into the world, I’ve moved out all on my own
I’m doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone
Seen shit you wouldn’t believe, I write em down in these poems
And put them out for the world, I know you listening too
Heard you saying shit about me I hope the shit isn’t true
Man look at the shit I came from, this narrow point of view
How you hatin’ on a nigga that wanted it more than you?
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too
And just because I ride with you, I scrap with them niggas too
Came back for them niggas too, ain’t no trappin nigga, it’s true
Yet they play me on repeat because I rap for them niggas too
See I started with nothing but passion and then I blew
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view

[Bridge]
Visions of home, visions of home
Visions of home, visions of home

[Verse 2]
Yeah, visions of home, this is my zone
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song
This for my cousin Ricky damn nigga it’s been too long
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin’ but to each his own
Gotta feed yo’ self, smoke a little weed just to ease yourself
Fuck the whole world, I don’t need your help
You’re the reason why momma had those rocks
All my niggas never even had no pops
Remember that? Ya remember that?
If ya don’t, double back
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street
But I’m still where the trouble at, where the trouble at?
That’s ‘cause my folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long, long
My folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long
Visions of home



[Hook: Johnny Venus]
Damn, feeling like the new nigga in my city
So confusing fool, you thought you knew what to do with me, uh
I've been on the rule
I've been out here getting baptized with the wave
It's a new vision, can you dig it?

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
This that juju, this that new new, oh new
Mash the fuck out for my folks who took that exit too soon
Neck still throwing coo coo
Existential Zulu
Call 'em anytime I want, now might pitch through the roof
This that scream and shout, now just like nana used to do
From the bottom so I ain't got much of it to prove
Seal lock my body, soul will not be moved
Lighting bolt through every coat, I stash my fucking move
Might hit Sylvan Rd. for the fuck of it
Searching for some closure, cracking open up a brew
Might hit Simpson Rd. for the fuck of it
Keep an eye on what these block 'ol calling crooks is doing
Catch a mili' while I Etch A Sketch another doodle
Catching feelings for them empty bubbles at the school
Yeah, what's it to you? What's the new [?]
Put my forearm in a sling, pen game Dr. Seuss
This that buy and buy, how'd you get so fucking cool?
Had to heel-toe out my body, girl, to tell the truth
Nigga feeling like I never catch up, that's the fuel
I've been here since the beginning like I promised you

[Hook: Johnny Venus]
Feeling like the new nigga in my city
So conflicting fool, you thought you knew what to do with me, uh
I've been on the rule
I've been out here getting baptized with the wave
It's a new vision, can you dig it?
Feeling like the new nigga in my city
So confusing fool, you thought you knew what to do with me, uh
I've been on the rule
I've been out here getting baptized with the wave
It's a new vision, can you dig it?

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
This is something from the soul, nothing that you used to
Since they got Cosby, hope mom still got that platinum Fubu
This that expert gurus
This that midnight oil scraping by your cup of noodles
Cocker spaniel in your poodle
Word to Gipp, grew up with my OGs bumpin' hella Goodie
Took a sip way too early
Young and horny grabbing booty
Bumping Fela Kuti
You should do your Googles
Scared to find out what this mix of drugs is doing to me
She said "where you at?"
I said "right on track"
JJ Dynamite
KKK outside, they not rocking white
Nah, they dipped in blue
Any sudden move, put you down on sight
Even if you got finger tips in the fucking sky
Then the news make it seem as if you deserved to die
If it wasn't 12 you'd lose your life to somebody you look like
Bow my head, pray and roll one up, Amen when I light
For the fuck of it, ain't no flick, nigga this is life

[Hook: Johnny Venus]
Feeling like the new nigga in my city
So confusing fool, you thought you knew what to do with me, uh
I've been on the rule
I've been out here getting baptized with the wave
It's a new vision, can you dig it?
Feeling like the new nigga in my city
So conflicting fool, you thought you knew what to do with me, uh
I've been on the rule
I've been out here getting baptized with the wave
It's a new vision, can you dig it?
Feeling like the new nigga in my city
So confusing fool, you thought you knew what to do with me, uh
I've been on the rule
I've been out here getting baptized with the wave
It's a new vision, can you dig it?



[Intro]
Hmm
Vhari, vhari
Yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
God is real and he usin' me for a bigger purpose
So fuck the world that would have you think that a nigga worthless
Sometimes I think that these verses can help a person
Way more than the ones they readin' in churches on days of worship
No disrespect to the Lord and Savior, that ain't just ego
I just observe that them words no longer relate to people
'Cause modern times be flooded with dollar signs
And social media stuntin', my niggas just wanna shine
They frame of mind so far removed from the days and times
Of Nazareth
Life these days is a labyrinth, in a maze so elaborate
We barely get through half of it 'fore it's too late
My niggas is felons from sellin' weight in more than two states
.22 in his waist before he could even shoot straight
Quick to draw on you like Aaron McGruder, nigga who fate?
All of that to say maybe the hood need a new faith
A new story about a boy from not too far where you stay

[Chorus]
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, there you go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here you go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here you go



[Hook: Noname]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon

[Verse 1: Noname]
If I was everything I never was
Drugs got me bubbly suddenly mumbling
Simile meant to be for you now
The futile go fishing for moon over roof top
A new style for praying to everything I ever loved
My black boy outer space looking like a rain child
But my body move like the sun
Go run til 'em rainbow we painted it 50 shades of grey
Stones across the lake, the house in the house
Deceptive carnations, our wedding we announced
On Sunday for the holy of it
Solely covet me and you, for you and I
Are blissfully tethered to simple redeeming
When sadness gets worse and we don't know why
Our city is bleeding for crimson
I don't protest, I just dance in my shadows
Hallow be thy empty
When my name don't sing, shallow waters
Under bridges don't forget 'bout me
Who are you to love me and not call me by my name?
I'm sunny, I'm sunny, just like you... Noname

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Like the sun, like the sun
Who are you to tell me I can't love you
The way mothers love daughters?
The way Mary was closest to Joseph
And babies is close to The Father
You don't know me and love got a secret hand shake
And mad inside jokes
I could tell it’s knock knock when my heart beatbox
Use your inside vox
Who are you to tell me I don’t want you
The way flesh wants freedom
The way greed love need, the way kings need kingdoms
You don’t know what I know, what I’m capable of
What I slaved for and traded in favours
And gave up for you what I gave up for love

[Hook: Noname]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You like the flower that I won’t let die
Right before your petals start to wilt
I choose to give you one last try
Fill your vase up with water, refusin’ to neglect you
Like your father, so I promise that it won’t run dry
Good intentions 'cause I wanna see us both fly
But I often put me first and I been wonderin’ why
I know you probably think you’re blessed
To have a wonderful guy
And that’s the truth but at the same time a wonderful lie
Cause to me you’re a dime and I’m still a nickel
And you know niggas say that every coin got two sides
Well if you knew both minds not sure you’d like what you find
I made mistakes, I want to tell you but can’t make up my mind
As I’m writing this I see a red balloon in the sky
And to me that’s a sign tellin’ me that these lines
Were meant to be written, repentin’ in the form of a rhyme
I know the Lord’s a forgiver, hope he’ll forgive me in time

[Hook: Noname]
Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon



They say "Vizzy we just wanna so you go in
Just go in!”
Well
Now watch me go
I Will, Thank you

[Verse 1]
On your mark, get ready, set
Always right I never left
Exhales, exiting hell, thank God for every breath
Shaking the devil wearing a cherry dress
Staying sincere as Nas on his belly shit

(Yes, now watch me go)
Can we get higher, probably, it’s not a thing
Nigga’s still talking ’bout dollars, Obama just wanted change
Decided you want that fire that go straight to your vein
Or do you want that Waka Flocka Flame?

(Now watch me go)
No one dissin’, I’m fine with co-existing
My lines is so intensive, my grind’s like toting pistons
From outta these bars, I shine like Sonny Liston
Now are you listening? Good

(Then Watch me go)
I’m so a Christian, but niggas at home is dissin’
Feeling drunk off of power, I’m bringing back prohibition
Niggas is loading pistols, to bring it to where I’m living
I promised y’all I would win it

(Now watch me go)
Showing it off, knowing I’m raw, oh my voice throwin’ you off?
Well how about I shout it from the same cliff I’m throwin you off?
Ahh, you on my balls, you should hold em, I’ll cough

(Now watch me go)
Still a D list, but at least on the list
Of emcee’s you cannot compete with, got a buzz
Now all a sudden, these honey’s that I could never be with
All hopping on XV dick

(Now watch me go)
You get shelved while movers is moving dressers
To my new house, where my old one? psh, I gave them my successor
And them girls wanna come through so I’m deciding who’s better
Cause they hard to deal with like playing cards glued together
(Watch me go)
With the flow and it’s always getting better
Call me Guinness book murderer, I’m killing every record
Ya’ll got half-assed class, you just a semester,
Spend yo' whole day chasing birds, call yo ass Sylvester

(Watch me go)
The elephant in the room gave me thick skin
Horton heard a "Who," and the labels just pitched in
Who woulda thought, that the way that I clinch pens
Would have me falling in love with the green with a Grinch grin

(Now watch me go)
‘O11 dropping blow up records
Tour bussin’ with bars he's moving
Smoking with J. Crow and captain
Had so many L’s thought we was going 0-11
Now I gotta do a show in a second

(Hold up, now watch me go)
Reaching the final level, my body glow
First it was my hands, then it was my soul
A lot of people loved it, but those that don’t know how a Kansas boy flow

(oh, watch me go)
Yeh, yeh, watch me go
Now watch me go!



[Intro: DJ Green Lantern, DJ Noodles & J. Cole]
I feel like we should just, you know, keep the world in suspense no longer
Yeah
And you know, just put J. Cole on the spot
Wooooo!
Yeah, is there anyway you can turn me up? Yeah, yeah
We got Roc Nation's first artist in here, J. Cole
Yeah, hey
On the spot
Yeah, there's no way to turn me up?
Got that?
If not, it's all good
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

[Verse]
I bet they never seen him comin', like a blind bitch you fuckin' from behind
It's the motherfuckin' dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like Lebron
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip-top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks
Flip flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Half black, other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a Cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me "Nigga stizz-op
You know you is not", wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip-hop, gassed up like a quick stop
They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot
Even if you squatted over volcanoes, niggas your shit not
I'm raw, but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legend
Praise God but I give not to the reverends
Lookin' up to the heavens like
"Where did all my blessings go?" You chase a dream
But then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch, here's an episode, professional
Set to blow any minute now, many women smile
Look the lights and the action, and the cameras be callin'
You niggas got to log in, bitch, you fantasy ballin'
I snuck up like I planned to be, this ain’t random, we called it
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that Twitter shit
Thought I get a deal and head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal I probably can't afford benefits
Medical, dental shit, left but I always came
Back like a rent-a-whip, dirty ass game
Dog, I could run a kennel with all these bitch niggas
Who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me, I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on 'em (hahaha!)
Start talking that beef shit, I turn to kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yeah! And I'll still keep goin', keep flowin'

[Outro: DJ Green Lantern, DJ Noodles & J. Cole]
Woooo! J. Cole! Yeah, J. Cole! Woo!
I don't think he's done, man, we need more
Yeah
I feel like he's not done, (Yeah) I feel like he's not done
He need's more, man



[Intro]
Yeah
Hey
Yeah, hey
Fayettenam, yeah
Bitch

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain
Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind, tryna figure where this 20 G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought, I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Counting days, still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small
Type of chick won't take her shirt off cause her titties too small
I could give a damn, girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that
At the door wit a towel on and nothin' under that
Saying welcome
Hey, yeah
Yeah, welcome
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I let these words flow out like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowd
Cause these words go deep from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hit the souls of all those that I've reached
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane
Man, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends
With the marijuana, wonder will this high ever end?
Swear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome
I tell 'em ain't nothin' wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own

[Outro]
Yeah, I deal with it on my own, nigga
Yeah, oh, welcome



[Verse 1]
Aye nigga I'm the best man
As if my best friend was getting married
Even with my eyes closed I'm something like a visionary
Paint you a perfect picture, nigga this is pictionary
Man they goin' have to put my picture in the dictionary
Right next to real then put your picture right next to fictionary
Claiming that you trill but you want bitches, all you niggas scary
Don't try to hide from it, oh boy we see you
Claim you goin' ride, oh no we don't believe you
Help wanted, classified, you need more people
Hating mind, I'm greater sign, hey we are no equal
My life is like a movie you like 3 or 4 previews
This the city where they glad to see your soul leave you
You're body laid back like neil so evil
Cole world baby 3 below zero
Getcha life snatched and your vehicle repo
I bring it to you live you gon' see it no TiVo

[Hook]
We on (nigga)
We on (cole world)
We on (cole world nigga)
We on
We on

[Verse 2]
Look man I'm tryna count money like a CFO you see us ho
Doing shows with hoes speaking languages that we don't know
Look here man, if love is blind then these bitches can't see no mo'
They fucking with the boy like a pedophile
If she won't go then we goin' roll cause J. Cole got a mean old flow
I looked up to some niggas but they ain't fuckin with me no more
Chip on my shoulder like I just left the casino oh
Nigga I been broke so don't hate me cause you don't see no dough
Hip-Hop was like Santa Claus cause no body believed no more
And then I came around, now nigga watch me paint the town
A lil black, a lil brown, a lil white, we a mess
This is Carolina repping you can check-in, be our guest
Me I'm blessed, shout to Khaled while I'm howlin' we da best
All these corny rap niggas tryna be my BFF
Nigga please, go head with that old bullshit you rhymin'
See this that good music, so we ain't got shit in common nigga

[Hook]

[Intro]
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick!"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"

[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no



[Intro]
This is a song about
This is a song about
When I was trying to get my first piece of pussy
Cole, Cole world
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Hands up, wasn’t nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Hands up, it wasn't nothin’ like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it
If she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin’, thinkin’ that I'm smashin’, but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain’t never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no (Say what?)
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said

And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

And I ain't never did this before, no

[Outro]
Fayetteville make some motherfuckin' noise one time tonight
On some 'ville shit
If you know what I'm talkin' 'bout tonight on some 'ville shit
If you can relate 'cause you had to go through the same shit
When you was a young boy, young girl
I'ma sing this shit, then you sing this shit
I sing then you sing, let's try this out
And it goes like
Said I ain't never did this before, go
I ain't never did this before, no
Said I ain't never did this before, go
I ain't never did this before, no
Said I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
Said I ain't never did this before, go
I ain't never did this before, no



This genesis will commit genocide. Each generated, generic generation of genders left to die
Everybody laughs when I set the parchment ablaze, but just know they won’t be laughin’ when the kid’s garnering fame
And I swear to fuckin’ God homie, I won’t rest ‘til I’m best of all
Dope lyricism I erect, my rapping’s seminal
I’m spittin’ venom in the specific direction of critics, prevent ‘em from opening their jibs on a record
I’m sick, I’m congested
I’ll give ‘em an enema, hit ‘em with hectic hisses and hinder ‘m, headless they’ll be within a second
You cannot spit. So merciless with this noggin
I’ll murder you with the pen like John Wick, aw shit
No escapin’ all of the thoughts and my mental
Make ‘em bleed as if they were popping a vessel
You all are ineffably awful and terrible
Quintessential when I’m on instrumentals
I’ve gone rouge! A relic of real rap ripping tracks
Witless acts are shook, like the hand of a business man
Give yo’ clan a reason to dart with resented art
Feastin’ on the bulky and the feeble we feed to the sharks
Who else do you know who can write like this?
So insane and erudite when they bust rhymes like this?
Who can grind like this?
They getting ensnared, cuz they don’t cut it, like a crazy, radical feminists leg hair
Now I’m vindictively, viciously vivisectin’ for doubtin’ the vision I’m representin’



[The Blessed Choir: Directed by Alvin Fields]
For being a precious friend
I give thanks to you
For holding our spirits high
I do thank you lord
For blessing my life each day
I give thanks to you
For always being there when all is said and done (Wooo)
Unto thee, do we give thanks

[Alvin Fields]
Now hol' on, hol' on, hol' up
Has anybody seen Jermaine? (No)
Jermaine
Where's Jermaine Cole?
He does this all the time...



[Intro: Dutch Masta]
You know, a lot of people out there think I'm doing this for the money
To be famous, to prove something, truth is there is no real reason I do this
Because music is all I know, hip hop just so happened to be the path that I chose
Whether or not the right people recognize my talent is all up to me
My grind determination and constant drive to be better at my craft
Is what seperates me from the boys to the men
From the rappers to the artists
It's what makes me, me
And who am I?

[Hook: Dutch Masta]
My name is Du du du du Dutch Masta
Better watch out cuz my flow is mo mo more faster (repeat 4x)

[Verse 1: Dutch Masta]
Fair weather rappers I have come to attack ya
Take one look at my stature I'm finna bring forth the rapture
Got a pet velociraptor thats my level of swagger
Home boy went to school to be my pilot must be one hell of a rapper
Come through the trap and we trap ya
Hang you by ya toes from the celing
There's no way this white boy raps no faster, these haters kill me
You can hate all fucking day because later on ya girl screaming my name
Dutch Masta! (who?) Dutch Masta (yeah)
But I'm climbing up the game to claim my fame
Trying not to fall but these lames keep yanking on my chain
Time to attack before these boys start shootin me
Even legends shoot feel threatened off what I'm doing B
Because mi famiglia not to violent
But won't hesitate to kill ya to spill blood
To fill up your gut with slugs no we won't show no love
And mercy for the weak
So listen up when I speak or retreat and accept defeat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dutch Masta]
When Dutchy pen hits paper
It's finna be something major
Scribble lyrics from my paper
Write in pen that's no eraser
Flipping the script always changing it up
So strap in ya seats because I'm driving the bus
Been thinking about her she been thinking about us
She showing crew love, yes I'm talking about your girl
Call her Ms Becky cuz her head gamemake my toes curl
My foes hurl make them dizzy when my flow twirls
Circus Circus carousel tongue merry go round my endless bars
And I'll serve you just right adios motherfucker take flight take a hike
Stay the fuck who the fuck what the fuck why the fuck get the fuck
Way the fuck away from me it's plain to see like A-Z
Like one plus 2 is always 3 just don't act to fresh with me
Or all you'll see is that 3 x 3 bang bang who dat? who der? not me
Not dapped in versace No Fear So Cal is who dress me
Snapback flannel aviays I conduct the swagger train
All white G Shock that shit cray, supras nikes and adidas
RIP Jam Master Jay all day I dream about beating beats up
So I freak the freak out of this beat
Feel the bass rumbling in your chest and feet
Every week I eat these beats to remind you that I'm still fucking hungry
Underground or mainstream message not partly cloudy
Got me on my level but I'm not smoking hyrdo
The devel writes my lyrics I call it inspirablo

[Hook}



[Verse 1 - YOMP]
I guess I’m just your worst nightmare
White kid rapping designing for retail
You start trembling like you are scared
They used to think that I was mentally impaired
And now I’m the guy that you aspire to be
Even though it high school I was the kid you bullied
America loves the story of the underdog
But I do it big, so I study abroad
By my clothes, I’m so unofficial
I may be qualified as a UN official
Rappers start asking me if I can do their production
Nah man I only do in-house production
I’m not being rude, I just have no time
So I have judge if you are worth my time
All my crew is super talented
I would like to see you try to challenge it
They say YOMP where’ve you been
I've been here the whole time
You were too busy laughing to know it was my time
They're already asking how are you not signed
I am to my label I don't have a cosign



[Intro]
Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 1]
Hey, who dat, who dat? That nigga you been waiting for
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshitting, fuck it I ain't hating though
Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 2]
Hey, the mind state of a winner
When you thinking about summertime I'm thinking about the winter
When you thinking about breakfast I'm heating up my dinner
I was plotting this moment back when y'all was riding spinners
Yeah I'm a menace, God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me, “Ain't you Roc? But where the fuck your chain at?”
Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to your day job, said you was hot? Well, they lied
Is that your girl? Well, I just G'd her, no A-Rod

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Interlude: Andre 3000]
Now who else want to fuck with Hollywood Cole?

[Verse 3]
The little engine that could, this little nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick, I heal niggas for good
A couple of y'all ain't took a field trip to the hood
And me? I'm fresh prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't saying names but we not the same
All the money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might want to grab you a chain, want to tip up your hat
Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack
I got my finger on the trigger, tell that nigga, “hold that”
Want picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey, so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I'm young, black, gifted, live my life on the run
Bet your bottom dollar before I'm done
They say that I'm the one, ya nigga I'm the one
I got them saying

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?



I'm more country than I come off
Toxic flow, call it industrial run off
Got your girl comin' to the crib for a one off
And if I'm gettin' put on that means you gettin' done off
Big boss nigga, black Corleone
In Beverly Hills gettin' my Ax Foley on
Money too mature, stacks fully grown
Its hash on the bowl so I'm actually stoned
But I'm back in the zone
Like I never left it
I'm better than these nigga I do it with less effort
With every new rapper, I'm feelin' less pressure
They got left over flows, these niggas is less fresher
That's why I'm in it to the finish
Relentless I diminish amateurs with every sentence
Beyond Batman the rap Terry McGuinness
I'm runnin' Hogwarts your the Sorcerer's Apprentice
So just call me yound Dumbledor
Big appetite and success is what I hunger for
I'm tryin to do better than anyone has done before
And I'm about my bottom line like an underscore
You don't want a war
This I guarantee
I even got the hardest rappers out scared of me
Trust me these niggas ain't as hard as they appear to be
And if you're a prince, then you're an heir to me
Cuz I'm the king nigga
I hold the crown nigga
I'm from the West coast, I hold it down nigga
I got your girl wet, I'm bout to drown nigga
I'm Pac to these hoes, cuz I get around nigga

K-O



[Intro]
Who dat who dat?

[Verse 1 - SD]
Back up on my 1, 2, 3 metaphors
I'm rhyming with CD, you would think I'm in stores
And y'all know me, I'm D-O-P-E
Screaming skins all day, no MTV
I see a girl giving out blows like a prize fighter
I'm on top of the words: call me a highlighter
Oral sex in the morning: that's a head start
Words like bullets, yeah I'm shopping at a Lead Mart
State of the Tar Heel, fuck how y'all feel
Young but I'm good, I got that fuckin John Wall feel
While y'all pissed off, I sit and sip Cristal
Hornet's nest flow, I assist like Chris Paul
Flow like a quick river, lines like a stick figure
So many drinks, I'll probably borrow someone else's liver
And I'm warming up just like a fireplace
I know I'm an acquired taste, go ahead and try to hate
But I'm just a brainiac who don't know where his brain be at
I'm smoking Huckleberry so I guess I'm Mark Twaining that
They told me I was insane, in fact
I'm tryna get my train on track
So you should probably counteract
The fact that you attacked the Datt

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Who dat who dat? You know what you been waiting for
I mean, the game was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshit - listen, I ain't hating, no
Now a brother, hot enough to fuck with one of satan's hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning
Feeling god would never listen
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Man, just look at how I elevated
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated
That means my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Just try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so the fiends keep on yelling back

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Childish Gambino]
I won't steal your girl? Test me
I stay Childish, watch me breast-feed
Grandfather ran numbers a criminal in Harlem
The only thing he used to make was trouble and my father
Father had me, said "Stay away from cocaine!"
Blood stained gangster, my swag screams dope game
I talk real nigga, this is what you ask for
I shit green like vegetarian assholes
Louder than Wayne's pants at the VMA's
Stick to what you good at nigga! Oh, everything?!
Niggas want me everywhere, I'm yelling out "Sorry!"
There's only one of me like white girls with black Barbies
Niggas mad that I ain't do shit too
I got a fly Asian bitch, that's a Shih Tzu
Throwing out your jazz man, but you don't look like Uncle Phil
Fucking girls from TV shows, my DVR is on the pill
Shake it on Youtube, yeah that's a VEVO ho
Black guy with a white voice, Cleveland Show
I don't know, all I wanted was different things
Hope these hood niggas don't blow me off when they're listening
All I do is wear what white guys wore in the '50's
And for some reason these white people think that it's interesting
Too many girls, that's still not enough for me
I love pussy like that old lady up the street
Everything I spit is compilated and best of
Black nerds run shit, go and ask Questlove
I'mma hit it twice, retail
I got a package like a gansta, G-mail
Google and a penis reference, same sentence, goody goody!
I love my dick so much they let a nigga host the Woodies
Got a whole barbershop like, "Oh man, this shit is tight!"
Solid shit.. one wipe..



Live from the city of dreams
You see I wrote and bag this dope in hopes of prettier things
If hope floats I took the boat up to the city of Queens
But phony niggas showed me quick this ain't the city of scenes
Hey! Fish out of water from the city of the dreamers
When young niggas feinding for them big body beamers
They told us we can have the world if I can get a deal
Maybe I could show the Ville that it's real

I put this on everything, I love
This is, my sweat and uhh my blood
(Who's world is this) You know it's mine
Boy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind
(Who's world is this) I'm gon ball
And uhh I'm gon shine and uhh I won't fall
(Who's world is this) I thought I told you this is my world baby
(It's mine, it's mine, it's mine)

Hey, straight out the Ville and I made it, hope you feeling my latest
Ayy what I spit on these pages highly anticipated, contagious
So when I spit it you gonna get it
Slightly different from these rappers who just spit but don't live it, see
I ain't no flashy nigga so don't expect me to floss
These niggas out here rappin with their fucking fingers crossed
I was a dreamer then I came up with a plan
Where I land I put it all on gods hands

I put this on everything, I love
This is, my sweat and uhh my blood
(Who's world is this) You know it's mine
Boy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind
(Who's world is this) I'm gon ball
And uhh I'm gon shine and uhh I won't fall
(Who's world is this) I thought I told you this is my world baby

And I feel like I got a loong way to go
And still I got a loong way to go
Feel like I got a loong way to go



[Chorus: J.I.D]
Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day, I gotta make it out

Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
My people know, perception is a clever disguise
Steady we roll, steady we navigate through the skies
Always been told "you better hurry, get out alive"
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to run to protect your hide
What if you hold, crumbled and cracked on a couple lies
It was still gone
Now you wonderin' where you fit in the file, better press on
Better hope that double click save your life
Gotta make it out
Shedding my skin, preparing to die
Gotta make it out

[Post-Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Here we go, here we go
We already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago
Here we go, here we go
You already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago

[Verse 2: Jordxn Bryant & Hollywood JB]
Bleeding led us cop the tone, now I'm sleeping better
Mama calling on the phone, I forget to text her
Lose sleep, cry week, biweekly
I talk to God, I don't see him, but I need him
I've been running out of road for a minute
I watch this dirt turn to gold in a minute
I grab a sow and it's written
Sit and wish and top it, just hope for a nigga
I'm feeling low, I'ma blow a whole O for my niggas

[Chorus: J.I.D]
Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day, I gotta make it out

Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day, I gotta make it out

[Post-Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Here we go, here we go
We already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago
Here we go, here we go
You already know life can get difficult
Shake my head at you, headed for typical
Breaking bread with my niggas from years ago, years ago



[Intro]
One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Verse]
Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, "blaow, blaow!", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, "Don't forget me"
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Outro]
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world
K.O.D
Choose wisely!

[Intro: J. Cole]
I gotta ask Jake One for the beat though
I don't know if he'll be cool with letting...
I don't know man it's really some album shit
Takin it up??

[Verse One: J. Cole]
Yeah winter schemes for my summer dreams
Winning seems to become routine
It's my thing
Underdog, never under yall
I touch down in your city like a hundred yard
Dash, never punt at all
Last thing I need is four downs
My baddest just graduated from Georgetown
Grad school, cause a nigga like em grown up
Im seeing rappers in the gym trying to tone up
I've seen rappers on the road, no one showed up
I feel partially to blame let me own up
I'm sorry, brand new Ferrari
But really though I'm frontin'
I really don't mind discussin
That Bugatti in that Beyonce video was just for stuntin'
Scared to mash the gas
Cause if I fucked around and crashed
That would have been my ass
That whip is 'bout a million cash (million cash?)
And dog I just got rich
How you gonna take a million from me, dog?
I just got this
Came a long way from that weak ass advance
Was in the Honda on that LIE passing fast
Wasn't about the money then cause he had the chance
Built it from the ground up, no hit singles
Just a lot of fucking gifts, nigga, no Kris Kringle
Cole
I'm the reason that your old bitch single
Gave her dick made her whole shit tingle ya feel me?
Born Sinner doubt this diamond chain gon' heal me
Lord let me kill the game and pray the game don't kill me
Multi before I die bitch believe that
These rappers rich as fuck but don't know where their seeds at
It's a shame, niggas lame, this is fame for ya
I gotta be the only one that didn't change for ya
I saw ya sortin through trash and brought change for ya
Open up their lane, do I gotta say names for ya?
And I ain't even flexin
Plottin on that Warm Up 2, I'm just stretchin
Fourth quarter, so much due but fuck stressin
I just step into the ring and do my mothafuckin thing (my mo'fuckin thing)
Fourth quarter, so much due but fuck stressin
I just step into the ring and do my mothafuckin thing (my mo'fuckin thing)
Wale kill these niggas man

[Verse 2: Wale]
Ugh, ugh
Wooooo! Gifted!
Ya! Spring greening but I'm winter frigid
And with this summer album got me booking all them bitches
Until I'm par with bitches, my parking garage official
Boy I play with foreigns and I feel just like Kawhi Leonard
God-given talent, momma gave me passion
Got me, a Rihanna feature, y'all should see my demographic
Copy us, dap me up, rapping niggas done got me fucked
Half these niggas is carbon copy, faking a nigga would be redundant right?
I'm tryna shed a bunch a light
In a country where niggas follow models and hype
You know, trends and that shit
Niggas wearing leather down in a 110
Just a classic-ass nigga
Rapping circles 'round these squares, out of shape, and I ain't tripping
Shoe game prolific, this Hublot a ticket. This Ron Simmons meets Richard Simmons, go Google their differences As I
Maneuver the industry, few is against me, I ride
With shooters but truthfully, tryna get loot out of Disney, I'm high
I'm tripping, I'm fried, forgive me, that's right, you with me
A cold world if I ain't slide by your chimney, we gifted
Tryna distribute what Allah has given me, listen
But some of the bars are synagogues to a godless opinion
And dig it, in layman's terms
Man these lames can't contain these words
New slaves we were, we were shut down, we were not proud for those things we stood
'Till we bust out, then bust down on that chain, we good
New black soul, new black soul, new black soul
Ain't toot my horn but I'm the new Satchmo
This Bishop Tutu with a 2Pac flow
You niggas think too slow, you Pikachu but I'm Picasso
Peep how I do it, gotta deep mind so I free my quotes
Peep my approach, I'm thinking more like Lee Iacocca
Come see my show, this shit look like that door knob broke
There's hoes and hoes, and I'm sure I'm bout to know like four
You P-Myers replace me, then that four-five show
And I'm just saying if I don't make it I'll still feed my folks
Still I keep shit real, I ain't never been a sucker though
Gold albums on my bronze game, fucking stupid
And I'll fucking do it, new legend shit got me juiced
Whoever got problems with Folarin come find me, pursue it
Remind you of a time there was knowledge in music
And I do it for the niggas that promise the future
New black soul, new black soul, new black soul
And any bitch that got me twisted only grew my fro
Ha, and it's like that, right? Right?
And it's like that, right?
Uh, uh, Gifted!



Cold blooded nigga, hoes love a nigga
She said she only fuck me and no other nigga
Don’t believe her but it’s nice to hear
Never ever thought life was fair
But I’m quite prepared
The boy nice cause he writes sincere
Draw straight from the heart send it right to ears
Think smart, play your part like Tyson here
Nigga I cheated death twice this year
I got the right to wear ice and swear like I never went to college
Or get direct deposits that could never fit in wallets
Clever but I’m ghetto tho I never lived in projects
On a level with the pilots, fuck the devil
This the hottest shit you’ll ever get to ride with
Though you’ll never get beside it
Got it, flow psychotic
Fruits of my labour, ya’ll hoped I rotted
Backpack and mainstream, both how I got it
Nas and Hov at the same damn time
Pac and BIG in the same damn mind
You can have a lot of whips and you can have a lot of chips
And you can have a lot of bitches but you can’t have mine



[Intro]
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Well straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)



[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's Cole, won't lie, won't stop 'til the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are
Usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina, where I made it from
Cole world, no blanket, son
Girls fast how Jamaicans run
Puffing on the city where the Lakers from: L-A, L-A, la la
So high, everything is a “ha ha” for me
Dreaming of the days of a drop 500
And a bad bitch that'll go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry
If you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mind wondering now, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not, hope not, hope not, hope not

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Yeah, just trying to make it, my nigga
(My world is empty without you)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
A wise nigga told me don’t chase that cash
Follow your heart, you’ll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass
Or does she wish to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face, just gassed
Like “baby girl, why you take this path?”
Stack in his hand, trynna make that last
All she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub titties in his face and laugh
Gotta try not to look fake, in fact
A little more money, like a few more 20’s
When you let that nigga grab your naked ass
Okay, he’s gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear
“This ain't the life for you, baby, let me take you out of here cause..."

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Yeah, she like "nigga, yeah right"
(My world is empty without you)
"You know how much motherfucking money I'm making?"

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my niggas sit back, blowing the L
Only getting high cause we closer to hell
Nigga trying to live like Hova, but well
We broke and that dough coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard in the snow, in the hail
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells
My mom broke, but she posted the bail
Someway, somehow
Nigga feeling like the sun down even when the sun up
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trying to raise her son up
'Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor couldn’t give one fuck
While she singing

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Damn, told you niggas "Cole world, no blanket"
(My world is empty without you)
Tough luck, yeah



Verse 1:
Friday, last night
My way, that’s right
People show they true colors in the dark so I light a flashlight and

See rainbows
See halos

See horns
She mourns
She can’t find a man in this world, a man in this world that she adores

So she pop her pussy for niggas thinking that’s how to love
She getting used and abuse, thinking she’s out of luck

She giving out chances
She giving out dances
She makes other girls sick, like she giving out cancer
She got niggas cheating, like she giving test answers
She’s running in place nigga, she living like a hamster

She losing herself, she losing her friends
But still giving head in a coupe that’s a Benz

All she wanted was affection
Now she got an infection
Fucked a nigga name Slim, without no protection
This should be a valuable lesson
But she did not get the message
Caught feelings for the nigga, & now she’s undressing
Fucked a nigga name Slim, & now she’s bound to get pregnant

Verse 2:
Later on, Slim gets a text
For the same broad who gives the neck

Said she pregnant, the child’s his
He said “bitch you crazy like asylums is”

But Slim ain’t sure if he pulled it out
Slim cussing, trying to cool out

And last thing Slim ever wanted
Just happened, Slims look haunted

His girl just came in the room
Seeing and smelling make up & perfume

With a PINK bra on the side of the bed
Imagine the thoughts inside of her head

Last night he was off them percs
Thinking that his girl gone at work
But he’s girl just left off from church
He seeing tears roll down her shirt

Slim tried to explain, girl said she ain’t trying hear it
Shorty driving insane, driving insane no hands that is steering

Not only was the cheating bad, she was crying aggressively
Not only was he popping pills, but Slim gave her a STD

Slim broke down, realized ain’t no jokes now
Girl stared at Slim, yeah she stare at him & then spoke loud

All I ever did was hold you down
It’s over now
She leaves the house, she’s broken down
Rolling around
With a phony smile



[Chorus: J. Cole]
Stick to the script boy, get hit boy
My life a movie, enjoy
I’m glad you waited, we finally here
This is that, that World Premiere
Come get with it
I’m ’bout to get it
You fuckin’ critic, you talk, I live it
To the coffin with it, I don’t need your reviews
Let's start the show and fuck the previews

[Verse 1: Elite]
W-w-welcome, buckle up with your seatbelts
And take them standards where you held them
Push them up a couple buildings
I be up there, it’s fun here
You see me, now wait one year
So high I’m talking Michael Jordan's sticking out his tongue air
I swear I feel like Ali when he finally fights
All the hype building up my fruits of labour, finally ripe
It’s that World Premiere if you listening
I hope you know what your witnessing
This motion picture I’m living in
It’s dope as shit and it’s just beginning
We here

[Pre-Chorus: Elite]
Big screen, now they looking up to me
I ain't seeing nothing you better pull up a seat

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Stick to the script boy, get hit boy
My life a movie, enjoy
I’m glad you waited, we finally here
This is that, that World Premiere
Come get with it
I’m ’bout to get it
You fuckin’ critic, you talk, I live it
To the coffin with it, I don’t need your reviews
Let's start the show and fuck the previews

[Verse 2: Elite]
Yeah, thanks Jermaine
I’m feeling pretty good, I can’t complain
To the labels they better raise they aim
I put my foot down til they ankle sprain
We ain't the same, y’all rap good, hooray for you
Y’all haters, beat, I made this too
Mix my shit so it bang too
All in my lil’ spare bedroom
Imagine where I’m headed
Edit it in my head until I get it perfect
Then I work it til I get it
It’s a problem in this bitch, to name at least shout out to Dreamville
Stars running checks, couldn’t get better, team build
Motherfucker

[Pre-Chorus: Elite]
Big screen, now they looking up to me
I ain't seeing nothing you better pull up a seat

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Stick to the script boy, get hit boy
My life a movie, enjoy
I’m glad you waited, we finally here
This is that, that World Premiere
Come get with it
I’m ’bout to get it
You fuckin’ critic, you talk, I live it
To the coffin with it, I don’t need your reviews
Let's start the show and fuck the previews

[Verse 3: Elite]
Who would've ever thought, I did bitch
If you sleeping, I’ma spit it 'til ya' eyelids split
This is tick tick tick, lick wick bomb shit
This the sure thing hit like the bitch you went to prom with
Never mind and doubt it y’all, y'all just be non-believers
Swear I’m bout to ball, I should be silent sneakers
Teach us some tricks, she spinnin like a porno star
Flip it to the otherside when she ride like a foreign car
Better want this more than y’all
Gotta put the pros before the cons
Ready gettin’ focused, ready gettin’ closer
Cue the fade out with a slow dissolve
*Applause*

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Stick to the script boy, get hit boy
My life a movie, enjoy
I’m glad you waited, we finally here
This is that, that World Premiere
Come get with it
I’m ’bout to get it
You fuckin’ critic, you talk, I live it
To the coffin with it, I don’t need your reviews
Let's start the show and fuck the previews



Dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits, so we ain’t stopping for the red lights, Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can hoe, they try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky, you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man?
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas ass no bikini man



When the Love is amplified
Hate is dissipated
If you heard me this far
So happy that you made it
So happy that you played it
Cause you didn't have to
Hear a single word
From the lonely bastard
Things ain't been the same
Since granddaddy left
I See the pain in granny's
Eyes
Remember I
Told her
I couldn't wait
Til the day
That he leaves
Just so she could breathe
But
That wasn't the answer
We all coulda talked
Maybe it was been his cancer
That made me walk
Away when
The man needed help
Down the stairs
Or my pride
Like his
Couldn't care
About the fact
That he would soon die
Or That moment
On the stairs
Would be the last time
I would see
The strongest one
Of God's human beings
But but
We pride intervene
Until the funeral
When I cried



Hello u smell like yellow and u r a fellow and a violin is playing to you next of kin and i fucker her raw and its almost like SAW ™ loui smells of chewing gum because his mum is fun ;) but then he decapitates a furry that goes by the name of james and then he sex lia and i sex his mum the end XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD



[Sample: Janelle Monáe]
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Hey one time, hey one time, one time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right
And girl you damn right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey Cole World, real cold world
I watch it hit the floor and watch it drop it real low girl
Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl
I had a crush now we grown and you still so thorough
Clap for her, work it till you exhausted
I swear ain't nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn your ex-man is a dumb ass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressing you, wasn’t fucking you right?
Well one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure
One damn thing you can’t change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together
It’s whatever, you shine, I shine
I know you got a 9-5 I’ll be your 5-9

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Hey one time, hey one time, one time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right
And girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)

[Sample: Janelle Monáe]
May this song reach your heart
Man, I could hear 'em saying
May this song reach your heart
Ayy, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, go ahead and pop it like you do in the mirror
I’m picking through the crowd tryna see a little clearer
High heel wearer, ugh, hell of a body
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody
Nope, I’m peeking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I don't bag I’ll be thinking bout your ass
For the whole week, no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine I'm gon' speak
I tell her my name Jermaine, I’m tryna be low key
She tell me I got that flame, your rhymes are so deep
Damn, girl thank you, shit, you so bad
Know your daddy wish he could still spank you, hol' up
'Fore these other niggas roll up and try get ya
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya
I’m tryna vibe witcha, so won't you throw me your phone number
And let them lames get your old number

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Hey one time, hey one time, one time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right
And girl you damn right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it), hey

[Sample: Janelle Monáe]
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart

[Verse 3: Wale]
Roc Nation, Wale, haha
Look, Cole world, still a cold world
And a couple you is cool but we a little more thorough, huh
Whole time, a little more girls
You know I spit that sick shit and there’s still no cure
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther
Love my women with high heels and high standards
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat
I ain't superstitious, I make all these broads split my pole
Ha, you dig it, this shit ain't for beginners
I’m something like a fetus, I'm not quite kidding
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block y'all vision
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop
Hundred K in twenty-two hours
See, money talks, you muthafuckers is Boomhauer
No check back, in debt, yep
Loud in my jay, y'all smoke that Gallaudet
Higher than I need to be, flyer 'cause I need to be
Love our conversation but it’s late right now, I need to beat
One time for the Ville that Cole rep
Another time for the city of the slow death
I don't understand why these niggas so vexed
I don't need no chains with no cross to know I’m blessed
Hold up!

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Hey one time, hey one time, one time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right
And girl you damn right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Check

[Chorus: J. Cole]
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Listen, music my flesh and blood, it's been my only love since ye high
I used to play Jay high and Ye high
Thinkin' one day I would go from fan to fuckin' player
I guess I found a way huh, my nigga Cozz wants Zendaya
A side note, I'm rootin' for you, I use these bars and start recruitin' for you
But treat her right
And just remember, on your lonely nights this mic will be your friend
You tell it all your secrets that you keepin' deep within
Your fantasies, regrets, your happy moments and your sins
And if he doesn't comprehend, at least he can pretend
Let's begin to be the men we never seen
In the 80's they smoke crack but now today they sippin' lean
And poppin' Xannies
Fuck niggas runnin' from their families
The streets don't give a fuck about the Grammys
Wish I could talk to granny, wish I could smoke in peace
But when I hit the blunt lately my mind it tortures me
Everything ain't supposed to be, apparently
I take it as a sign and stick the shit that's steerin' me
In the direction of some clarity
This music is my therapy, I thank the Lord 'cause he care for me

[Chorus: J. Cole & Cozz]
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?You know I gotta thank God
How else I make it this far? (far)

[Verse 2: Cozz]
Music is my soul and fuel
I guess it only saves a chosen few
From goin' to school or sellin' dope, crazy
Back in school, I was bumpin' Cole daily
Now I'm writin' rhymes in the notebook that Cole gave me
And bro you so crazy, but all I can do is thank you
You threw your boy a lob, and shit, I ain't even say to
But fuck it, all that shit he say true
'Cause you a dime, I'm sure you hear that every day, cool
So look, fuck bein' fine 'cause I know you got a brain too
And shit, let me not get my plate full, you know your brain moves
A little different when you haven't ate food
So I'ma leave it up to fate to make these decisions
And stick to my intentions
I did it for more of the passion, not the great checks
Knowin' that there's more than fat asses and great sex
Tryna be the man I ain't yet
But demons stuck on me like ashes on gray sweats
'Cause man I ain't made shit and I'm lackin' the patience
It's a battle to take in' the fact that I ain't win, yet
What am I sayin', I can't complain when
I travel and take trips, I look to God then I thank Him

[Chorus: Cozz]
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
Yeah, how else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
You know I gotta thank God
How else I make it this far? (far)

[Verse 3: Cozz]
Look, I ain't got money to blow but I'm gettin' there, dawg
Can't get momma a home but I'm gettin' there y'all
Won't reach the end of the road, just sittin' there dawg
How you gon' learn to grow if you ain't listenin' y'all?
Look, I'm still a student of the game but I been through some things
And I could school you at this age don't be clueless in the brain
You gotta learn to fly before you cruisin' with the planes
And you could be a boss, just gotta do it in your lane
Choosin' and choose to pray instead of choosin' prey
To use and abuse for pay
You doin' it for the love or you doin' it to get praised?
What would you do for fame?
If it was family or money, they probably lose you today
Probably go buy a car and try and coupe with the pain
Sometimes homies and hoes is truly the same
Try and screw you for change, yeah it's truly a shame
But somehow I seem to see the beauty in the rain
I made it this far



[Spanish]

Ya casi me olvide este idioma
Quiero manejarlo porque voy por la corona
Ya no tengo algo mas que decir
Con mi gente en el barrio
Que mas que pedir
El amor
Tengo que parar con estas cosas
Es difícil porque estos días vienen como locas
Ya no se que hacer
Si yo me voy con ella, yo no puedo volver
Si yo sigo con ella, ya esta mi mujer
No lo quiero, tengo demasiado que perder
Digo todo bien
Parce, todo todo bien
Saludame si puedes, siempre en el tren
En el bus o en el club, un placer conocerlos
Por eso estoy hablando por aquí, puede ser dos
Tres o quatro gente que me escuchan, no importa
Yo soy Miggu, mucho gusto, la buena a los que luchan
Mucho gusto, yo soy Miggu, la buena a los que luchan

[Norwegian]

Cartagena uten fluz, mann
Cartagena uten hus, mann, vet at det var sjukt, mann
Makarena på en gul strand
Makarena på en gul strand

Skjønner du nå hva jeg prøver å si
God blir’u i det du øver på, si
Tør å ta sjanser
Vit at du hanskes med folk som ikke gjør noe på si
Du har en glød vi kan bygge på
Ekke no nød, vi er trygge nå
Ekke no søk etter hygge nå
For vi har annet å tygge på
Jakter inner’n din og legger ned en jobb
Kjører fotofinish med min egen skygge som i bob
Leker helt Lucky Luke
Jakter publikum, så slenger no’ på bordet, som en duk
De sier at Miggu er sjuk, som om jeg skulka en time
Å kun fordi jeg rimer til det renner som i sluk
Bagen som ligger på bordet er mjuk
Vent, bare vent til vi tar det i bruk
Trendsettere, som bachata og zouk
Viser oss fram som i sommer på Huk
Og de sier at jeg ikke er hip-hop
Bør ikke være no’ tvil med alle rima i en fil
DropBox hakke plass til all den dritten jeg har spint opp
Møt meg i en battle og vær klar til å bli spist opp
Ekke oppspinn, fårn inn med toppspinn
Motivasjonen min, vil du jeg skal liste opp?
Gått inn, spytter ti’re er vått
Heng deg på Miggu, når jeg rapper putt en fist opp
Ah, heng deg på Miggu når jeg rapper putt en fist opp
Putt en fist opp

[English]

Yeah, we talk like motherfucking kids talk
Fascinated by the game, appreciate a crip walk
Keep dreaming, even when that shit’s dark
I don’t know when, but when it hits, it hits hard
Imma, monster on the beat, every lingo
That’s why I go hard from el lunes to domingo
I’ll hit you with a single
Providing what you need
That will fix your self-esteem like some coke for a gringo
You will see, you will see
But now we talk now
Where I wanna be
I hope you all can take my energy
It’s just a thing in me
That’s going to explode
I need to get off the load
I guess I’ll keep on rapping ‘til infinity
Cause otherwise this life is killing me
I go like give one, take one
Roll it up then we make one
Give it up to a real one and giving it to a fake one
I guess it’s all about my honesty
I am honestly, often with a smile
All this haters I don’t hate, none
All this haters I don’t hate, none
