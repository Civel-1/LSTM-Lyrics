03' Adolescence by J. Cole

[Produced by Willie B]

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga [inaudible] slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]
I never felt better

1985 (DJ Premier 1966 Remix) by J. Cole & DJ Premier

[Intro: 2Pac]
19-motherfuckin'

[Verse: J. Cole]
1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop

[Outro: Xzibit, C.L. Smooth  & JAY-Z]
Listen to my niggas so-so you can wake up
The-the way I play the rap game, call it prophecy
Or understand the intelligence that Jay has

1985 (Türkçe Çeviri) by J. Cole

1985, ben doğdum
33 yıl, vay be, hayatta olduğum için minnetarım
25'imizi geçmememiz gerekiyordu
Şakalar sana amcık, hala hayattayım
Yeni çıkan zencilerin hepsi genç
Herkes onların yaptığı müziğin aptalca olduğunu söylüyor
18 yaşımı hatırlıyorum da
Para, parti, amcık, ben de aynı şeylerin peşindeydim
Çocuklara büyümeleri için şans tanımalısın
Bugünlerde herkes bir şeyler biliyormuş gibi konuşuyor
Zenciler ayık gibi davranıyorlar ancak onlar parasızlar
Çabanızı takdir ediyorum ancak bu günlere sizler öncülük ediyorsunuz
Adamım, daha araba sürecek yaşta bile değiller
Onlara ne yapacaklarını söylemek mi? Ben kimim?
Onlardan birinin beni disslediğini duydum, şaşırdım
Yaklaş küçük adam, seninle konuşmama izin ver
Bakalım senin için büyük resmi çizebilecek miyim
Tebrikler, annenin evinden ayrılabildin
Umarım annene bir ev alabilecek kadar kazanırsın
Bakıyorum saatin parıltılı ve araban pahalı
Bir tavsiyem var, tur yapmayı asla bırakma
Çünkü bu günlerde biz rapçiler böyle kazanıyoruz
Garip lil rap isimlerinle dalga geçiyorum
Müziğini duyuyorum ve rap'in değiştiğini biliyorum
Bazıları bunun kötü bir şey olduğunu söyleyebilir
Çünkü artık her şey reklama dayalı ve pop
Trap drumlar havalı olan şeyler artık
Görüyorsun, yeni nesil için bir görevdeyim
Neyse boşver, bu sadece bir geçiş
Söylemem gerekli ki parçalarından etkilenmedim, hey
Ancak siyahi birinin para kazanması hoşuma gidiyor
Ayrıca bu işten zevk alıyorsun ve buna saygı duyuyorum
Ancak yarattığın etki üzerinde hiç düşündün mü?
Bu beyaz çocuklar senin hiç bir şeyi umursamamanı seviyorlar
Çünkü tenin siyah olduğunda senden bunu bekliyorlar
Senin dab atmanı bekliyorlar, senin hap atmanı bekliyorlar
Suratından topuklarına kadar dövme içinde olmanı bekliyorlar
Ve derinlerde bir yerlerde, siktir, gerçekçi olmam lazım
Onlar siyahi olmak istiyorlar ve parçalarının öyle hissettirdiğini düşünüyorlar
Yani sen bir şey yaptığında onların da yaptığını görebilirsin
Sonraki şehire geç, zamanı geldiğinde paranı topla
Paranı alıp, sürtükler içinde yüzüyorsun, seni suçlamıyorum
Ancak benim ve senin gibi gözükmeye çalışan insanları düşünmüyorsun
Doğru, yapman gereken daha önemli şeyler var
Kazandığın paralarla bir varoşu satın alabilirsin
Biliyorum bu gelir hiç bitmeyecekmiş gibi hissediyorsun
Ancak sana bunun doğru olmadığını söylemeliyim
Bir gün seni dinleyen çocuklar büyüyecek
Ve senin patlamana sebep olan şey için çok yaşlı olacaklar
Artık onlar gelmediği için şovların zayıf gözükecek
Ve bu ne yazık ki paranın azalması demek
Şimdi tekrar göz önüne gelmek için umuyor ve kıvranıyorsun
Ancak trendleri takip ettiğin için patladığını unutuyorsun
Şimdi sen eskidin ve pişmanlıklar içinden geçiyorsun
Çünkü o evi satın almadın, yerine Benz aldın
Onlarca mücevher ve ayakkabı aldın
Onlarca sahte arkadaş edindin, seni yargılamıyorum
Sadece rap yaptığın konu hakkında rap yapmaya  devam edersen neler olacağını söylüyorum
Dibe gitmek için iyi bir rota
Sana iyi şanslar diliyorum
İyiliğin için göründüğün kadar aptal olmadığını umuyorum
Ancak insanların söyledikleri gerçekse
Gerçekten benim adımla dalga geçiyorsan
O zaman gerçekten boku yediğini bilirim, güven bana
Sonsuza kadar çevrende olurum çünkü yeteneklerim yeri boylamak isteyen tüm zenciler için kusursuz
İşler boka sardığında dediklerimi hatırla
Beş yıl içinde Love&Hiphop'a çıkacaksın zenci

2012 by J. Cole

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed
Never met death, well, at least not yet
Off to the place where they rest under flowers
Niggas get wetter, like sex in the shower
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?
I know the world is going to come to an ending
Before it does can finish up my sinning?
I see the devil grinning, as if he was winning
This is the bottom of the ninth inning
I'm coming back like light skinned
What a sad sight, looking at my gas light
Like "Damn man, I just threw 10 in"
Look five dollars won't get you what it use too
And look, love don't mean what it use too
And everybody and their mommas on youtube
Is it just me, or is this unusual?
Don't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll
So let me slow down, to the beat ya'll
Put the remote down, move your feet dawg
One time for the niggas holding heat ya'll
Keep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt
See me, I rather cut catch her body give birth
If you were the last nigga walking on earth
Turn yourself and clap your hands like this was church

[Hook: J. Cole]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I say money make the girls go down
They say money make the world go 'round
So my broke niggas, ain't it a shame
If Bill Gates made it rain
Then world goin' drown
Can I get a dollar?
Shawty got a low Impala
Made that ass drop, hydrola', holla!
Know she got a man, and I don't understand
Why he don't grab that bitch by the collar
Follow, look uh
I need my women a little hood
Living in a world where bad means good
That explains why the bad hoes attract 'em
That explains why the bad rappers go platinum
Or gold these days, go DJ
If the world stops spinning like a old DJ
Keep playing, I need a little more time
Pre paying, just a few more dimes
We slaying, keep praying, hoping
2012? You gotta be joking!
Ain't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign
But +The Whole World+ done lost they minds
Look, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville
This is not a test, this is not a drill
This is all real so before we all kill
Let me get one more feel. Baby!

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Lil Cole]
Yeah, hey
Duck motherfuckers, run for your lives motherfucker
It's Lil Cole nigga. hahaha
The world is coming to an end nigga (It's coming to an end motherfucker, haha)
It's coming to an end trust me
I see it all revelation motherfuckers, all that shit
It's Lil Cole, you know I'm going in straight in to heaven nigga, holla at me

[Bridge x2]
Earthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes
You meaner than Katrina baby I gotta know your name
Before this thing is over this might be the last song
For the man upstairs put the lights on and shut this party down

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

2Face by J. Cole

[Produced By Syience]

[Intro]
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And I'm all up in that spot
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Throwin' blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like

[Outro]
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey

3 Wishes by J. Cole

[Verse]
Yeah, grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega Man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, a real black queen
If I had a genie, I'd wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house this shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know this shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying "Get off me!"
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only twelve
I wish I wouldla bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared a nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self-defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, ayo genie last wish, free my nigga

4 Your Eyez Only by J. Cole

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only

Ain't That Some Shit (Interlude) by J. Cole

[Intro]
Okay, I lied
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood—true lie
See, I would, but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo' bitch, give yo' niggas dap
The hood gon' ballistic
Cole was here and you missed it
That nigga walk like Obama man
Shook yo momma hand and then kissed it
This pimp shit, this pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard, no wimp shit
Put in that work, no temp shit
Ya bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rapping shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggas move 'caine like Kappa shit
Can't map this shit
From no bed springs in my mattresses
To fuckin' these bad little actresses
I'm bad as shit, ha

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Chorus]
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit, bitch

[Bridge]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce

[Verse 2]
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight, put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
So if you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the newer shit, rockin' jewel shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable?
Keep niggas on they toes, no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Chorus]
Say what?
Ain't that some shit

My nigga Syience killed this motherfucking beat

Album of the Year (Freestyle) by J. Cole

[Verse]
Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes—but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathia's
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD—album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late MC whose name was The Notorious—
Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back
Next up to bat is my nigga, Bas
After that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's that New York City kid plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell

Apparently by J. Cole

[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

A Star is Born (BET Performance) by J. Cole

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth
Now, if you was the last man walking on Earth
Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church
Hey…and clap for him…

A Tale of 2 Citiez by J. Cole

[Produced by Vinylz]

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

Atlantic City Freestyle by J. Cole

No album to my name and I’m already hot
You could say I’m preheated
If money talks, mine telling yours to be seated
Cut my leg off, I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game, bitch
And you can retweet it
E-mail the shit, make sure you Cc it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I be in the airport, damn near barefoot
Security hollering out “Cole, we need it!”
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinking, I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain’t no fucking G, boy
Your style G-rated
Hatred is flattery, glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late, now it’s happy belated

ATM by J. Cole

[Intro]
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)
With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
Of Devil's pie

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres

[Bridge]
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'...

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

[Verse 2]
Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die
Uno dos

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart
And hope to die
With my slice of Devil’s pie

Autism Speaks Apology Letter by J. Cole

Recently there’s been a trend that includes rappers saying something offensive, only to be attacked for it in the media and pressured to apologize. I have to be completely honest and say there’s a part of me that resents that. I view rap similar to how I view comedy. It’s going to ruffle feathers at times. It’s going to go “too far”. I do not believe that an apology is needed every time someone is offended, especially when that apology is really only for the sake of saving an endorsement or cleaning up bad press.

With that said, this is not the case today. This letter is sincere.
This apology IS necessary.

In a recent verse on the song “Jodeci Freestyle”, I said something
highly offensive to people with Autism. Last week, when I first saw a comment from someone outraged about the lyric, I realized right away that what I said was wrong. I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant enough say something so hurtful. What makes the crime worse is that I should have known better.

To the entire Autism community who expressed outrage, I’m moved and inspired by your passion, and I’m amazed at how strong you are as a unit. I have now read stories online from parents about their struggles and triumphs with raising an Autistic child and I admire how incredibly strong you have to be to do so. It’s touching. It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real shame. You have every right to be angry.

To anyone suffering from Autism, either mildly or severely, I am sorry. I’m bound to make mistakes in my life, but in my heart I just want to spread Love.

I want to educate myself more on Autism, and I’ll gladly own my mistake and serve as an example to today’s generation that there’s nothing cool about mean-spirited comments about someone with Autism. People with this disorder and their loved ones have to go through so much already, the last thing they need is to hear something as ignorant as what I said. I understand.

To the parents who are fighting through the frustrations that must
come with raising a child with severe autism, finding strength and
patience that they never knew they had; to the college student with Asperger’s Syndrome; to all those overcoming Autism. You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere apology.

Much Love

-Cole

Back to the Topic (Freestyle) by J. Cole

[Intro]
"Yeah, nigga
I'mma go ahead and murder this shit
Voice gone and shit, I think it's gon' make it sound a lil'–a lil' ill...
A lil' iller
Yeah, fayettenam... nigga."

[Verse]
Yeah, Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya na’ lie
My world a little darker, like a fuckin' tan line
Go on, look for a better nigga: girl you can’t find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma’am, I’m an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I’m armed and I’m Fayetnam’s finest
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion 'cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it’s all said and done I’mma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins. Bad chicks? Send em in
Basic hoes? Toss em out, can’t even get Waffle House
Hatin’ niggas? Chalk em out. Go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about? Lil man
My shit here burning, you not even lil’ tan
I’m ill enough to kill cancer: baby, I’m chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you-know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, "girl, I don’t care"
You better get yours fore I reach mine
Cause then I’m throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum: Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I’m quarterbacking, trying to get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever, Cole is like the leader
Of the new niggas, to tell the truth I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of you niggas get lapped, I sit back
And reflect on the rap game
I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out “The ‘Ville, I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that vagina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer
I could give a fuck as long as there’s something that’s behind of her
Got the type of bump that make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I’m the shit...oh yeah, I’m reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem
And I’m ghost

Before I'm Gone by J. Cole

[Verse 1]
I hit the weed, I told myself the last time would be my last
I don’t trust my own niggas, now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass
Boy, you know my L’s dirty, if they stop me I’m goin' to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me
"Man, let me out, send me back to bitches that smell purdy"
And all I gotta do is call once and she 'dere all ready
Yeah, buddy, can't you tell I'm goin; through hell
I don’t even open my mail
I’m in the shower with soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now i’m getting plenty money

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 2]
Look kid, its raining outside boy
Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin’
Cole the wrong one bringin’ the city shine
All he ever doin’ is paintin’ pictures of crime
Tellin’ stories of pain, paintin’ pictures of dope
Bitch if you listenin' I’m paintin’ pictures of hope
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin’ my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin’ the streets hey ma I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin’ hoes, was out hoopin’
Them niggas wasn’t ballin’ but yet they was foul shootin’
So meet the newest role model who don’t know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Outro]
Girl it’s been so long, I’ve been gone from you
But you ain’t gotta worry ’bout the thangs I do
It’s hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon’ know our name
Ain’t seen you smile in awhile
But I been dreamin’ ’bout you

Be Free by J. Cole

[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my niggas die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying to pull away.  At no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took off running

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired 7 more shots and my friend died

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

Be Free (Live on The Late Show with David Letterman) by J. Cole

[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no X-Ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my people die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Verse 3]
Forget this chain, cause this ain't me
Though I'm eternally grateful to Jay Z
We so elated, we celebrated like Obama waited until his last day in office to tell the nation, brothers is getting their reparations, hey
A man can dream, can't he?
No disrespect, in terms of change I haven't seen any
Maybe he had good intentions but was stifled by the system
And was sad to learn that he actually couldn't bring any
That's what I get for thinking, this world is fair
They let a brother steer the ship
And never told him that the ship was sinkin'
But I got other shit to think about, like my bank account
Forget that watch, you paid too much for it
You 'ought to be ashamed
When brothers back home be dreading when the seasons change
Cause they ain't got no heat and they ain't got no AC
WalMart distribution fired my homie, he just had a baby
You wonder why it's been so many B and E's lately
While brothers from the hood shooting like this is TNT lately
And since all the ballers leaving college early
I turn on the TV and don't see no brothers with degrees lately

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Outro]
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off...

Be (Freestyle) by J. Cole

Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrows
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rose
Playing Jigga hits he say good, make more those
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digiornos
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the 'caine
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I've done been a nerd
Just to tutor bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I'm just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got her coming now he might've been the first
So she only fuck with hymn/him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you're black they won't employ ya'
Well nigga I'mma show ya', this that Jesse Jackson
Af-firmative action so master I'm taxing uh
Don't let the cover fool ya', bitch I ain't no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don't gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a Ville nigga 'til the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know what I paid for this shit? bitch, you got damn right!

Best Friend by J. Cole

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
See your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
What she do, double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how man dogging me
My best friend say, don't tell her nothing 'bout me and you
Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy
My best friend say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I’ll be there, I’ll still be there for you

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me
We breaking up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, than you start listening
To friends, and then it, gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

[Bridge]
My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
I’ll still be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling, let me know whats on your mind
We’ve been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I’m never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Bitchez by J. Cole (Ft. Bas & Omen)

[Produced by Omen]

[Intro: J. Cole]
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)
You know who this is dedicated to

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 1: Bas]
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?
Bitch, I don't care
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Got a bitch like a diamond
Bitch got no flaws
See the switch when she walk
Give the bitch an applause
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want
Fly to another continent if I want
Ride through the projects if I want
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, TDK, TDK
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite
I don't talk much, but I say a lot
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot
When we sweating in the dark don't run
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run
She a square but that ass rotund
She let me cut samurai shogun
Know you heard bout the backstroke
I can make your perm turn to an afro
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches
Nice girls, classy women
I'm too official
Dreamville, nigga too official
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

Black Friday by J. Cole

[Produced by Pharrell Williams & Sounwave]

[Intro]
Yeah
Ten toes to the ground
Yeah

[Hook 1]
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight these demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain? blaow
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight them demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?

[Verse 1]
If I quote it nigga, I wrote it nigga
Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga
Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga

[Hook 2]
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?
(Right there let me get that there
Talk about it)
Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?
(Talk about it)
Nada
(If you really believe it, gotta talk about it
You heard about what happens when you talk about it
Niggas lookin’ at you funny when they start to doubt it
Fucking up your energy when you start to doubt it too)
Rollercoaster ride
(Start to doubt it too)
How much do it cost?
(Start to doubt it)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost
(Shoutout my nigga Ib)
Rollercoaster ride, how much do it cost?
(El Presidente and shit)
(He want me to talk my shit for y'all)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost

[Verse 2]
Cole world you should stay off this dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand

[Outro]
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker
"When you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...
(Censor Tone)

Black Friday feat. Kendrick Lamar by J. Cole (Ft. Kendrick Lamar)

[Intro]
Dick hard like Rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

[Verse]
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Hiiigher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God-bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha)

But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand

[Outro]
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker
"When you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...
(Censor Tone)

Blowin' Smoke by J. Cole

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?

[Outro]
Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up

Blow Up by J. Cole

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 1]
Hey, I came up
I warmed up, the next up
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Now don’t it sound legendary
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up and bitch I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say: "What you fighting for? The game is on life support"
And Gary Coleman just passed: life is short
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early just to get in free
And wait for hoes to show up
But now its bottles at them tables, bring the models boy
I’m about to po’ up
Uh ha, you know what
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Left side, left side
Right side, right side
Left side, left side, hey

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 2]
Mama said I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever
Ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go
Hit the club she drop it low
Lower than my credit score
Account overdraft what I got this debit for
So much debt it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle
You border like Mexico
Hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at?
And what ya cook like?
She said "where ya bread at
And what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other well brother good night"

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 3]
Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles
You mean to tell me everything gon be fine
If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you could blow up
And maybe you could blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up

Blow Up (Xaphoon Jones ColeStep Remix) by J. Cole

Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up

Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side uh huh
Left side, left side, hey

        Born Sinner by J. Cole (Ft. James Fauntleroy)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point us right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music business is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane"; My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: J. Cole]
This shit is a gift

BRACKETS by J. Cole

[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
"Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made"
You know what he'd say? "You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit," hah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

[Interlude]
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Breakdown by J. Cole

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Yeah

Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down
Uh, break the break down...

Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down...

Bring Em In by J. Cole

[Bridge]
I wasn't looking for you
I wasn't searching
I wasn't creeping around
I wasn't lurking
I wasn't sleeping around
I wasn't thirsting
But, I got a thang for you
I got a thang for you

[Verse 1: J Cole]
You on ya job, and it's damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you
Hey, baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make a man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through ya city, I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminding you of Friday
I can take you to DC introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parle, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room, we call this do the hard way, hard way!

[Hook]
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend

Bring em in (x4)
And if they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the grrr! It's just you, me, and them

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl you lookin' like the new Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
A stewardess and yet you flew the leer
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for ya
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catchin' bodies
How I'm stretching you, guess no need to go get pilates
When I'm sliding through ya city, meet me in the lobby
And you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the morning? while you moaning probably
Got you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a hobby
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy
Don't mind me, I put it down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J Cole]
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons
Whisper to ya home girls you love Cole World
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse you know
The type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf footballs
I got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth
Because I'm so clever better than ho-eva
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed, the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (Ahhhh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's 0-11, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you so fed up, and so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header
I won't let up

[Hook]

If you want to be a King then I suggest you vote for Bun
Like that

Caged Bird by J. Cole (Ft. Omen)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, caged bird
Some'n' like a caged bird
Caged bird
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You ain't a man till you stop chasing your friends, my nigga
Think for yourself, make your own plans, my nigga
I'll be lying if I said I ain't understand, my nigga
'Cause who you gon' follow when the leaders all get swallowed
By reefer clouds and bottles
In and out of county jail
This is hell, see the young black males in packed cells
With they heads down
And they fists clenched tight
Thinking, "I could bust a hole through this wall
And, bitch, I just might."
It's just like the caged bird; I sing a song
Hoping they open up these bars and send a nigga home
I cry when I'm alone
I'm wondering why would God send me here
Knowing that they hate us
Knowing that they make us feel like we evil so we kill our people
Without a second thought, in every lesson taught by OGs
We full of real nigga wisdom, so we proceed
Like real niggas who been stripped of our humanity
I see the judge's eyes, I know that he ain't understanding me

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage

[Verse 2: Omen]
Well, it's the oratory vet
Turned down king slash poet laureate
Used to paint a picture with a story of neglect
I could've been a shorty drinking 40s on the steps
With a shorty on my lap
With a shorty on the way coming shortly to protect
I could've been a dealer in the party with the X
But I'm hardly in the mix and I partially confess
I definitely got a couple parts in me that I regret
Is the cup half-empty or is it half-full?
I fill mine up with Hennessy, then get back to him
I'm just a jazz musician trapped in a rap form
You think you standing for something you on a trap door
Well it's the, Mr. Introspective
I'm a dreamers dream, a sort of an inception
I never fiend for the scene but I dreamed of the things
That a Mercedes brings, like slow sex with fast women
Drinking cognac I'm past grinning
A sexy dress, fat ass in it
But still hit it till I'm half-winded
Cause niggas tell me I'm the shit when I be hitting all these dimes
See I'm caged by the visions of the blind
I started as a king
Turned to a slave
Put us in our chains
We was forced to entertain
Thinking bout the present day I'm living off the stage
Wonder if a nigga ever get up out this cage
As I sing

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage

Can I Bus by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah
It's therapist
The golden child
Yeah
Peep what I'm saying
Yo, yo, check it, yo

[Verse 1]
Yeah you cats is fly but your plane is crashing
You came and passed
My range blasting
I came slashing
Same fashion
That OJ stabbed him
My brain's packed with more lines than caine addicts
These insane raps should stay wrapped in a Straitjacket
You featherweight class bitch
Don't want mine
That's why your whole squad is telling me
"Pick on someone your own size"
I got the whole nine
Ain't perfect but I'm border lining
My album come with a surgeon general's warning on it (Sick)
I spit a born vomit
The hot shit
Even when I die shit
I'll still be the livest
Quit with the nonsense
You hating but you feeling it though
Stepped on stage
Got arrested for stealing the show
Stealing the zone
Never left it
Niggas never contested
On a five star scale you get one less then Texas (Get it)
I got narcoleptics
Why the whote now
When this shit goes down
Niggas barely show up when I show down
I hold ground
Go more rounds than carrousels
And you beating me only happens in fairy tales
You dreaming
My pieces is so dope you feinding
That Cole flow you sink
When I dive off the deep end
I'm head hunting
Heads front
But ain't said nothing
So heads up or spill red blood cause your head is gushing
Bitch what
No STD's
But still a sick fuck
You blast from point blank range and never hit once
I'm heaven sent
From devilish
To Specialist
You niggas couldn't make a good impression of what cements
So throw up the white flag
No need to fight back
Drop your mic
Head to the freezer
And grab the knife pack
Get your lights snatched
I'm cold as the ice cap
Sold my soul to satan
Turned around and stole it right back
I'm jacking dead broke folks cause I'm dirt poorer
I tried to ball but fouled out in the first quarter
Flagrant rhymes
The facts that you proclaiming
They aiming the same phrase as mine
Taking the same frame of mind
I'm out to shine on any track that I'm hopping on
Changing album names
The false alarm
It's not the bomb
The style is off the wall
Kick shit like Bandhan
Therapist is the man
Hands down like a handstand
With a grand flow and my heart had to follow
I'm so ahead of my time I wrote this rhyme tomorrow, what

Can I Get Witcha by J. Cole (Ft. The Notorious B.I.G.)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do
Uhh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm tryna get with ya girl, I ain't even going stunt
Miss Fat booty, man I seen it from the front
I mean that shit was pumped, had me fiending from the jump
And that ass was right, shit would make a fag look twice
So I approach like “shawty , whats good with cha?”
Nigga was hopin’ to go back to the hood with ya
And yeah I see them other niggas tryna look at cha
Wouldn’t slang the thing right even if they could get ya
Me I’m from the Ville where we learn how to mack well
And you gon’ yell when I hit it from the back well
Take you to the crib and throw on a little Maxwell
Grab a condom know cause, shit, I don’t know you that well
Haa, was fucking with that
Far from hater but see dem brothers was wack
So don’t you worry bout them mean muggin’ girl
I’m tougher than that
And niggas mad cause this light skinned brotha is back
I’m sayin’ though

[Hook & Interlude]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Stripes on the Polo
On the late night, fucking your wife on the low low
My pipe like a pogo stick, no homo
No ice but I’m cold though
Cologne on my nuts in case she might wanna go low
I’m from the Ville where niggas fight for the dolo
So think twice or take the same advice from the fo’fo’
Me running to PoPo and muthaf-ckin’ no go
A Carolina nigga, I’m the muthaf-ckin logo
Shit, fly as hell on my ozone shit
Disrespect me nigga you could get your cornroll split
And that goes for you too, I’m on my Bono shit
Niggas got no delivery thats that Digiorno shit
I got porno chicks callin’, I still neglect them nigga
I’m about my money like a bill collector
For you slow niggas I put it more in laymans
If you ain't talkin’ money its a foreign language
But uh, shawty can I get wit cha

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

Can I Holla At Ya by J. Cole

[Sample: Lauryn Hill]
One day, you're gonna understand...

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey
Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Special, never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a, son to his mother, or a
Sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don't even speak
But know it's love though
Could never let 'em dirty your name
I got the utmost respect for you
Came back home and had to check for you
Word round town is you locked down
Some older nigga snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be—
She like, "If you was me you wouldn't wait for me
Living fast and wouldn't mash the brakes for me"
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back and
Time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

[Hook: J. Cole]
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ay let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ay let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me
The day you played my momma you played me
Can't believe I let you in my heart nigga
I shoulda, followed my instincts, a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house
I was too young to scrap you, but damn if I ain't want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you, uh
Thirteen years, knew you more than my real pops
Put me on to 'Pac and all the rappers that killed cops
Who woulda thought that you'd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga "why you lie?"
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppings
Heard you tryna talk, tell that punk don't call me
You ain't shit, and I'm scared it rubbed off on me

[Hook: J. Cole]
I holla at you
I holla at you
Ay let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ay let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit, I hope it ain't true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you
'Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don't know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing so you expected me to act strange
Ain't holla but you on my mind nigga
I don't forget the good times nigga
White tees in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
We had potential to be monumental, 'ville mentality
You know that old kill-or-be-killed mentality
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality
'Cause where you s'posed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin' hoes like the old days, but now we overseas
Dawg, congratulations on your seed
Yo my nigga

[Hook: J. Cole]
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ay let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ay let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—
Hey

Can I Live by J. Cole

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could
Said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first little taste of paper and I splurged
I guess it's just a nigga urge
This is The Boondocks
I swear, yo, I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be tryna save the world, and then on Friday, I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting, damn
Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes, I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live,  my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ay, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me

[Bridge]
But oh no, Lord
You see, I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?
Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be goddamned if I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'ma make it to the top
So I'ma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop

[Verse 2]
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?

Can't Cry by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah
Need y’all niggas to feel me, yo
Feel my pain
Said soft niggas can’t last hard times, yo
Believe that shit
Yeah, (Yeah) aye (Aye)
Real niggas don’t cry
Look, yo

[Verse 1]
Was just a youngin’ with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything I’m wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw nigga, but shit done changed since Maine was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I’m a man worried about my fam
Let me explain
It’s like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit’s sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
You feeling like the world’s on your back so you stumble
In the field like a quarterback get sacked, then you fumble
Jobs don’t call a nigga back, so it’s back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms, the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost faith
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral (damn)

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
But I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no
(ay, ay, ay, yea)
(listen, yo)

[Verse 2]
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weather’s bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like, “Damn it’s ’06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?” (that shit old, dawg)
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate in like three weeks, some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement, uh (rest in peace)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her, she was standing at the bus stop
Wait, man she was eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
Every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)
They killed her only son
Now she wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man, I can’t watch this shit

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Verse 3]
Take a ride through the city man, tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits
Violence, hatred, real devastation
Neighborhoods looking like there’s still segregation
Welfare, single mothers, no jobs
Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
Fiends in the street so high off of that crack shit
This nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress (bang!)
White folks got the road to success mapped and that’s all good
But why don’t blacks got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
And it seems like I done prayed for a million days
But still the ills remain, just bills and pain
Shootouts in project buildings, children slain
Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can’t though

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Outro]
Yeah, shit dedicated to my cousin Ricky man
Hoop dreams cut short man
Learned he had a baby on the way
Nigga wasn’t even a senior in high school, though
Hold your head man

Can't Get Enough by J. Cole (Ft. Trey Songz)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

Carolina On My Mind by J. Cole (Ft. Deacon (Singer))

[Intro]
Yea Yea, uh
It's Carolina, nigga
Yeah
Ay
Fayettenam
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Listen, alive and still kickin nigga
I survived the ville
But a lot will not, so they wield Glocks and Bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill
Money hungry, tryna find a meal
Can't stay inside and chill
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas
Lying like they on the pill
Preachers say we blessed
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel gates
My mind is still- racing, I'm tryna kill- snakes
Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
Yeah

Yo, Coming home, y'all
Listen
At any given time, got the city on my mind
The city on my mind
The city on my mind
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
At any given time, Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine
I'm tryna go for mine

Hey
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show
Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose
Money goes, the money come
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks
The Carolina way
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say
Cause in Carolina- we thorough
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G-boro
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yea
Yo, coming home nigga!

[Verse 2: Deacon]
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like
Ooh!
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'
Blew game and I do my thing
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring
Oh no!
Riding with my niggas for the weekend
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
Ooh!

Chaining Day by J. Cole

[Intro]
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

[Verse 1]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"
This is chaining day

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear
They even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear

[Verse 3]
Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said this shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
Cause I love this slavery

[Outro]
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I said this is my last time

Change by J. Cole

[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—

Change The World by J. Cole

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Let me tell you a little story about my homie Corey
Right now he's locked down serving at least forty
But excuse me, I got ahead of myself, I'm sorry son
This story starts in his youth, he was hardly one
When his pops got knocked for coping rocks
From under cover cops on the corner of his block
And he never got a chance to meet him
Cause the very next year his pops is laying still in the prison cell bleeding from stab wounds, fatal
Bad news Corey's mother and older brother already caught in the struggle
Brother barely ate tryna hustle just to carry weight
The whole family underweight cause they rarely ate
One thing my nigga never got was love
And his whole childhood he was watching drug addicts
His brother supplying it, old mother buying it
You expect a scientist to come from this environment
Get real!, this shits hard enough brought up black
But being poor plus your mums on crack
And your brothers a hustler tryna take you under his wing shit, just a fucking wonder his breathing

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Age five, Corey had dreams to be a cop, but
Age six, his older brother passed the Glock, let him hold it
Plans change, he started his campaign
Age thirteen, little boy doing big man things
And that's what he thought
He was jacking rims from mustangs
Beating down on his class mates for chump change
Running round with the tough gang
The older niggas he sold dope for 'em, they bought clothes for him
However, soon he got older and selling petty dimes turned into some pretty heavy crimes
The shit got to the point where he was stealing rides from his block
Even robbing quick stops
Ladies loved him, he was crazy fucking
Knocking boos daily, pretty soon he had a baby coming
But he didn't claim it, his baby mother was crazy loving him
She said "Baby, let's settle down," he left her hanging
He'd rather be on the streets slanging a wild cat
But god damn i seen it coming a mile back
A drug deal gone bad guns bursting
Now Corey lying in a cell cause he merked him
Whats the moral of the story?, figure it out
So the next time you ask why niggas are wild
You know with out a doubt, don't try and deny the shit
Young black male, a product of his environment

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cause i can't stand to see my people struggling
But what we up against? tough conditions in this life
And they wonder why these niggas all get hype, get high and fist fight
Or why they live like they living, to get ice and cars
No type of jobs, income coming from dicing and robbing niggas in broad daylight
Its hard cause all they know in this life is scars
This mic is all i need to change the globe, re-arrange it and make it so
Niggas ain't in pain no more
Cause they they don't pay no more mind to all youth
Till they got to locking them up and dawg that's the truth yo
Thats the truth yo, that's the truth

Cheer Up by J. Cole

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, school girl, cool girl
You dressing sexy and your mama is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folks thang
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool, girl
You got your new hair, it look so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him 'round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it?
It's cause your mind don't match what your ass got
But cheer up, you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're lookin' for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter, you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking...

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the Glock to my head, feel I rather be dead
Hey, am I hopeless? Raised with rats and roaches
Never liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask "what's the matter?" but you can't relate
Living the life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I’m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother, yeah I love her
But things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer
Darkened my heart and I don't know if I’ll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She said she proud of me and I wonder what for?
And once more

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey

Got a neat freak that don't eat meat, but goddamn she rocking them furs
Ball so hard mothafucka wanna fine me, and now the hoe wanna climb me

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no budget
Go! Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ayy
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?
Next time I'ma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon' shock her
"You're so tall, what team do you play for?" No bitch, I'm a doctor
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah
Float like a propeller, no helicopter shit
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber
Nigga say they pop cause they dont fill they collars up
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up
Bitch nigga...

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (2 Chainz)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start off with these four bars
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar
I'm rockin' gold bars, whoop your ass with this crowbar
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin' re-coupe
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin' on gas, full service
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)

Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Outro: J Cole]
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models

Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'

I need to let it go, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he's throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying: "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...

[Verse 2]
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them 90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
Cause I'm finta, drop knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dumbies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets, but nigga that ain't really where they were
Acting just like there they were, but who am I to judge?
That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If i had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera, at the same time
And put name tags on they titties so I don’t get they name wrong
Screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from sampling now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas, 
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer
But the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...

[Outro]
June 25th. Born Sinner. Bitch

Cole World by J. Cole

[Intro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like...)
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha, bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "When?", Bitch! When I feel like it

[Hook]
Cole World (World), Cole Life (Life), Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

[Verse 2]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me (Woohoo!)
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me (Woohoo!)
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story (Woohoo!)
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

Hm, Ok, we're outta here (O-o-o-key-key-key)
I think it's safe to say we outta here
(We outta here, we outta here, we-we-we)
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here

[Outro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night (Night, night, night)
A hell of a night (Night, night, night)
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like)
Hey (Hey, hey, hey...)

College Boy by J. Cole

[Verse 1]
It's hard to picture a nigga not getting money
J. Cole living bummy? Hahaha that shit is funny
I’m focused on that cash, I just laugh at them bastards
Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor’s
And if this rap shit don’t work, I’m going for my Master’s
Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades
A nigga straight A’s like the Braves
She got me in her dorm room, talking bout her room ain’t clean
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leaves
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seeing
Cuz if the girl get excited, she’s invited. (haha)

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh, I hate to brag, well naw, I don’t, the big man on campus
I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga glances
And if your ass is dumb you won’t even get a chance
Cuz I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga answers, yea
And if I hit ya shorty, keep it on the low
This shit just like highschool, people wanna know
I see you haters mad, but I ain’t mad at y’all niggas
We get ass like them basketball niggas, I’m ballin’
Got a sidekick so them hoes don’t be callin’!
Hit me on aim, ay what’s your screen name?
When I start typing in, a nigga’s got some mean game, yea
And when I whip it out, shit she gonna think she seeing things, but
Back in Carolina I miss home badly, (yea)
It’s funny hoes I couldn’t have is tryna bag me
But I’m in the Jeep with this freaky ass Aggy
She said she want it from the back, gladly

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 3]
I’m skipping class just to get some ass, living fast
And college with no sleep nigga, my jabs quick as Zab's
So kill that old college gangsta shit we dont believe
You mad cuz your girl on Facebook poking me, so uh
You know the G, I hit her up like “Hello Elle
I see you looking right the other day, LOL
So, what’s good with you?”
She hit me right back like “Shit, what’s good with you?”
You know I like that, so of course I write back
Hit her with some nice chat
Same night she in my room, lights off I strike that
Yea I put game right, but that’s your wife, nigga take her
I bust then I kick her ass out to write a paper, yea (hahaha)
A nigga doing homework, drinking like a fish
It ain’t a weekend that I’m sober
Fighting hangovers on my way to my internship
And I forgot to study for my midterm, shit!

[Outro]
Hahahaha, wooo!
Ay, this is straight through, nigga
No, no fucking, no double takes
This is straight through the whole shit nigga
Check it out man, tryna tell y’all niggas man
College is a good look
A real good look, my nigga
For more reasons than one, man
Know they try to keep us out of that shit though
That shit like extra expensive
I got scholarships though, so you know I’m not sweating that
I feel for my niggas that couldn’t make it man
Ay Mike we in there baby, hahaah
Ay they can’t, they can’t keep us out the G my nigga, you know
Then we all make it, nah, we ain’t all make it
Shout out to my niggas, man
All my niggas, yo
Whether you graduated or not
Whether you made it to college or not, nigga
Fayettenam, yeah, yeah
Class of 2007 man
Holla at me
I’m going to grad school though, you know?

Coming Home by J. Cole (Ft. Skylar Grey)

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Back where I belong
I’ve never felt so strong eh
Feeling like there’s nothing that I can’t try
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is my story this is my song
If you ain't got the heart, don’t attempt to try this at home
It’s just a poem from a man once living wrong
Now I’m in the zone, tell the World I’m coming home
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
Who’d have thought we’d be running rap when we was knee high
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
Or cause I’m famous you don’t gotta know what pain is
But I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind
But one thing I never lose is my grind
My closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can’t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
And then help me get my genius out
And get back to what I had
If my good’s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it’s on my diary, I’m living for my kids
Now they is just as fly as me
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

Cosmic Kev Freestyle by J. Cole

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that’s flattering but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y’all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, ask me if I gained weight, I said nah
My pockets got fatter, that’s all
Money was an issue but now that that’s solved, I ball, I ball
Like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantel
Dawg my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me
How that feel? Very happy (very happy)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Cole World, Boy, check the degree’s
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze
That’s why I blew up on you sucka’s all thats left is debris
One soldier’s all that’s left is fatigues
Act like you know me boy, I’m Kobe
How the fuck you gon step in my league
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling?
‘Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen
I’m ’bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin’
Killin’ niggas like K K K violence
I guess it’s why they pay homage
Momma I’mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..
Whatever man

[Beat Change]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin’
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin’
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin’
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown huntin’
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin’ like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peatin’
And I’m knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin’
The label heat seekin’, nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin’
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

[Break]
I’m heavy
I’m heavy
Man these niggas get exlusives
Hey, hey

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Man, I’m already hot, you can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your’s “be seated”
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin’ out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinkin’ I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fuckin’ bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just happy he made it
My money was running late now, now it’s happy belated
I’m heavy, nigga I’m heavy

Cost Me A Lot by J. Cole

[Intro (Sampled): Billie Holiday (J. Cole)]
What can I do?
It’s cost me a lot
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
(Shit homie) It’s cost me a lot (Shit homie)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y’all can see I’m ballin’, HD

[Refrain]
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that

[Verse 2]
Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word

        Crooked Smile by J. Cole (Ft. TLC)

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Ad-Libs: Choir]

[Outro: Choir]
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Round

Crooked Smile (Original) by J. Cole

[Verse 1]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus]
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Verse 2]
Listen
I got a story for ya, when I was seventeen
I had a name, was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nuttin' new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin'
Going nowhere, I figured, "Fuck it, there's a couple hoes here"
I might as well sign up and climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse, spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage, I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like I dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga, DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat fast, the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak, that is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger that killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again, I begged my mom for braces, then I had a

[Chorus]
Crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile

[Verse 3]
Growing up was just a young knucklehead running wild
Momma youngest, e'erybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile, snaggletooth nigga for a while
Liftin' up my pillow, tooth fairy never came around
Damn, we was po', but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily, look and wonder how my teeth'll grow
They came slow and out of line, I couldn't comprehend
The significance at the time, this crooked smile
Was just another sign saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah, remember Brandy? Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga, Sosa, I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear, J's drop
He got a fresh new pair, and there I was with hand-me-downs
Turn into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention

[Chorus]
With this crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Outro]
"Crooked Smile". You know what it is. This is for those that's—that's not picture perfect, but we still worth the picture, you know? As I sit here and sip this Corona. Ayy, shout out to Brandy, man. I—I still got love for ya. I'll never forget, we was in the fifth grade, maybe it was later than that, but remember we was at the [?] we had the orchestra thing and you told—you told a white girl, you told her to tell me that if I went and got some braces that you would go out with a nigga [?] shit. Ah, those were the days. I still got love for ya. You know shit like that made a nigga tough

Crunch Time by J. Cole

[Intro: J. Cole]
Tick
This is for my niggas in the fourth quarter
Just watching that clock tick. Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You said, "at what point do you start seeing bread?
Been out hustling for years, shoe box right under my bed
I move the work out my momma’s house, got me a little old crib
I always fantasize if I had went to college instead
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek I’m better off dead
Fucking with this white, it’s all been downhill like a sled
Now listen, I understand they say you make your own bed
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread
In denial about the feds, he can’t see past bread
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?
These are the times, survival my only crime
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone
Inside of me Lord I know, it’s a lie that we gon' be fine
But momma I’m tired of crying, just lie to me one more time"

[Hook]
Cause it’s crunch time
Cause it’s crunch time
Shit real man
A nigga got bills man it’s crunch time

Shit real man a nigga got bills

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Look, scavenge these records of these days MP3’s
Looking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV’s
This is for nigga’s with empty dreams and empty jeans
Still holding on to the word maybe
Cause this 9 to 5 shit is driving you stir crazy
Coming home tired just to hear it from your lady
Hollering about your baby, need this and need that
And all you want is peace and quiet
Maybe some feedback, on these raps
Cause labels ain’t hollering, and niggas ain't downloading
Nobody see your vision, they walking around blindfolded
All this time holding on to possibilities
You step outside, you smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze
Fuck what they talking, it ain’t like life come often
Only thing worse than death is a regret filled coffin
So try before you die or always wonder what if?
I thank the lord for this wonderful gift
Looking for strength in this crunch time

[Hook]
Looking for strength in the crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg
It’s crunch time, yeah nigga it’s crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg

[Outro: J. Cole]
I feel your pain nigga trust me
For all my nigga’s out there still trying to get it
Few nigga’s I know, few nigga’s I don’t know

Shout out to my nigga FilthE
Nervous Reck
Shout out to Marcus
My nigga I forgive you for all that shit you said
I understand my nigga
Still love. Yeah

Daddy's Little Girl by J. Cole

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck ya girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy, what you think?", "Little girl, you're growin' up
Growin up"

[Chorus]
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?" "little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Can I get a witness, this is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey, Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up, growin' up"

[Chorus]
Hey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up"
Hey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

Dead Presidents by J. Cole

[Intro]
Let me try this
Uh, Yeah
Money coming soon
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
Omen what up nigga?
Yea niggaaaa, yea, uh

[Verse 1]
Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?(true)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that! (haha)
Like fuck it I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks spend dough on mad shit for stuntin,'(yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid. (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things, (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin'
But them whites ain't. (hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation,"(yea)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating,)
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em. (yea)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention, (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition, (ahaha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition, (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't into doing, they into wishin,'

Yeah
Uh
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln

Dead Presidents II by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah, Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
These niggas is playing
Russian Roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless, no, we don't dance
All we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2]
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be LeBron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it

[Pre-Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled)  & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

        Deja Vu by J. Cole

[Intro]
Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Bridge]
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising

[Outro]
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

        Disgusting by J. Cole

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 1]
Hey, oh no, not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick?
If so, I take her on a voyage
I like 'em long-legged, mega thick
Work it out, you know, employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit?
Cause I keep clogging up the toilet
Coley Cole, fresh as a 4-week old
Not a scratch on me, hoes ask for me
Niggas ask about me, silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the real, this nigga give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label give you the deal
You remind them of me, let's see, how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will?
Ill

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 2]
Enough of that bullshit cake rap
With your childlike scriptures
I'm busting off, nigga, take that
Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood say "We fucking with you Cole, see?
And we're gonna ride right with ya
Yeah, we know you got college degrees
But we got priors like Richard"
And here we are, raps just like CPR
Nigga turn on your TV, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like E.T., completely we be from Mars
Damn he got bars, as if he's speaking of CB4
Need a barrage of freaky broads to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minajs, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods, and yes
Her ass clap and so that's a round of applause, I guess

[Hook]
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

DJ Enuff Freestyle by J. Cole (Ft. XV)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Fast lane, looking bad thang with them brains
From the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I’m high as God
Why is it Lord that I can’t seem to slow the whip down?
The same boy standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don’t follow rules
Carter blues, nigga hold up, y’all still don’t got a clue
Yeah, all the cool niggas from high school that still ain’t doing shit
‘Member when y’all used to fuck niggas till they blue and shit?
Now your ass broke as a joke and them niggas doing it
Funny how the tables turned and life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy ‘less he need a dollar from his baby mama
And y’all still don’t wear a condom, is you stupid nigga?
Falling in love with these hoes, is you Cupid nigga?
You better learn ‘fore you burn boy, see me stay on top of my game, David Stern boy
Did this dirt like worms, now my mom was more concerned with the future
Y’all niggas stuck in neutral, this a city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya, I’m here to get ya higher baby so this here the booster
I’m tryna be the king, this that Martin Luther
Shit is crucial, now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ‘Ville, still pourin' liquor ‘fore my niggas killed

[Verse 2: XV]
Look, it’s too bad that he’s too good
Never giving up but it’s sad that you would
My crew like a couple of clansmen, too hood
And when it came to putting on Kansas, who would?
Vizzy, no trying, couple figures on and I’m sitting on Bryants
Game started buzzing so I’m sitting on hydrants
Nah Joe, I’m highjack, you can call me a Somali pirate
All black wallet, inside Irish, mean it’s all green
Yeah, I’m mean with this fly shit, they buzzing like bees in a high nest
Girls getting on they knees for your highness
And I’m running these streets, no bright vest
Stick to the paper, damn, I’m a fly catch
I’m tryna live more, die less and if you tryna get yours, holla X, XV
You should OD off of this rhyme ‘cause I’mma change minds like cold feet
In store for a meal, groceries but they be like “We don’t normally come out at night mostly”
Go and get your rosaries ‘cause I’m about kill this, no halo like Sony
And if your girl a little horse like a pony, ahem, well of course, start pointing
Fly Boy Club, well of course I’m soaring, always gonna
Always be in the air like Jordan
And they always gonna stare, just ignore ‘em
Now you with the X man, I’mma call you Storm
I’m touring her, under that hood and um it’s foreign up under that hood and um
I feel like a dude this cool should feel so I guess I feel good and um XV, J.Cole, we in

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Busting, I'm going off, sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me, these hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club, you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God but to me, she found Satan
She only getting hotter, what's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said “That's cool nigga but can you buy the Benz?”
She playing niggas like a violin, I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day’s found, this is my playground

[Verse 4: XV]
Look, I’mma spit it from the top of the dome, don’t normally do this
But I’m feeling real cool, I am ruthless, like Eazy-E was, I am toothless
Like that one fiend was, I am killing shit like I never do this
I never do this but I’m gonna spit it straight from the top oh
And I know niggas done heard about Kansas but I’m about to do this motherfucker
I done ran shit since ‘02 and I was like oh and y’all niggas don’t know
I’m about to prove man what everything that I’m doing is about to do a movement
X to the V, who you booing? Look, I don’t even do this normally but I’mma do this
Accordingly, cordially, I am dope, yes dude
I have never wrote this shit down in my head
I have spoke shit you that never ever said
‘Cause I’m dope, y’all niggas dead, fresh, chill nigga, I am gonna get this
X to the V, y’all niggas witness, I’m about to throw ‘em back, ruler this
Y’all niggas doing this, y’all niggas know that I’m moving shit
And if you don’t know it right now, google it, I’m about to be on every blog
Doing shit, I’m about to do this shit like E told me do, look, look, I don’t know

[Verse 5: J.Cole]
What do I gotta do to prove to you I’m not the dude for you to just try to fool with?
Niggas ain’t got a clue bitch, niggas wanna bullshit
Don’t know that my crew thicker than these cute bitches, we normally knocking boots with
Too slick to grip, my nigga should stop that
That verse was so old that I done forgot that
But now I come off the top with the hot raps
Niggas know you better stop that
Coming through, got the Glock cocked back
Nigga I ain’t even got one
Nigga, I’m aiming at your face with the shotgun
Lyrically, spiritually
Niggas tryna mirror me but I’m vampire and I’m so damn higher than the average nigga
Can you get witcha ya? I just signed with Jigga, nigga how high you figure?
Damn, I’m slipping up on my words but my verbs so sick that I never slip
Niggas know uh-uh, please save me XV

[Verse 6: XV]
They be like Vizzy on some other shit, on his MCDs ‘cause they loving it
Pockets fat like the Klumps in it, my flow is something sick, no asking
Proactive couldn’t stop bumping it, nowadays I be on some other shit
Ladies think I’m gone kinda like my upper lip, wrong
Like a broken condom, pause, ‘cause Hoff go raw
It’s something you really shouldn’t be fucking with
Came through whipping, paint still dripping
They say like Sheneneh, oh no you didn’t
Know that one saying when your palm start itching?
Well mine do some much, I had to start to wear mittens
And you think that I’m kidding, if I don’t slow down
They gon’ think that I’m driven, if I don’t go down, she gon’ think I hate fishing
Chill for a minute and I was like listen, Vizzy, gettin’, gettin’, gettin’
Y’all motherfuckers know I’m about to spit it straight up off the top of the dome again
How this nigga doing that? He be going in, I don’t even know shit
I be just blowing shit, I don’t even smoke and shit, how you know this?
By enrolling it, I don’t even know I got a backpack on
If you see me, take a flick of me and you niggas gonna blow the shit
‘Cause you were pointing at me like he gonna blow and shit
And them niggas be knowing it, if I be doing this shit all around the world and shit
All around the globe with it, man y’all niggas spit it in, I just get it in
Flow out here and manager from Switzerland, nigga from Kansas
And y’all niggas whipping it, how you motherfuckers doing it?

Dolla and A Dream by J. Cole

[Intro]
For all my ville niggas man
All my Carolina niggas man, (lights off and shit)
All my real niggas, no matter where you come from

[Verse]
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'mma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, "Honey, I'm home."
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer

You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man
My niggas know about the struggle, man
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma

Dolla and a Dream II by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah, aye wassup man? Aye, uh, aye look man, can I- can I get on- can I just get on this bus? All I got is a dollar fifty, I'm just sayin'. I just tryna get- I'm tryna get on the bus, man. I ain't got no mon- all I got is a dollar fifty, I don't go two dollars. Man, fuck you and yo' bus, nigga!
(Yeah)
Hey, hey (Yeah, got a dollar and a dream)
Yeah, yeah
I got a dollar and a dream (Yeah), yeah
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, hey (Hey, I'm dreamin')

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh)
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that (Past that), a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq (Uh-huh)
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle, nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spittin'
This that pulpit, I’m hittin' niggas with the gospel (And the lord said)
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your mama or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of siftin' through my mail, I feel like Cartwright, bills (Bills and bills and bills)
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talkin', man, I know how niggas feel

[Chorus]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(God damn, nigga. These motherfuckin' bill collectors, man)
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(Can't even God damn turn on my phone without these nigga ringin' me up)
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
(They tryna call me from different numbers and shit. Tryna- tryna fool me, nigga. I'm Lil Cole, nigga!)
Yeah, got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seem
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king (Uh-huh)
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump (Haha)
They shootin' niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinkin' that I’m slangin', man, I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar, plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and looked away like she want it
I ain't sayin' I'ma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirt with a nigga, this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first (Nah)
This is church, this is gospel (And the lord said)
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Yeah, ayy, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh-uh, uh, uh)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Wait 'til I get my money ri- hehehehe)
Everything ain't what it seem
Yeah, I got a dollar and a dream, yeah, I got a dollar and a dream
(Wait 'til I get my money right, I'm dreamin')

[Verse 3]
Check it
Aye Sallie, I know I ain't been answerin' your calls (Aww, not this bitch, yeah)
But shit, let me explain- (I can explain, I can explain)
It's because times been hard
Been runnin' 'round tryna find a job (I can't get no job)
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you (God damn), can't even front, I press ignore (Yeah)
I still got your letters layin' in my dresser drawer (Haha)
You tellin' me about all the things you did for me (I know, I know, I know, I know)
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me (I know, I know, big for me)
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my mama cosigned (Haha, yeah)
But in no time, a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl, I'm sad to say it
But I was usin' you, you gave a nigga major stacks (Major stacks)
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gon' pay you back
I got a dollar and a dream

[Outro]
I'll pay you back. Look, can we- can we set up some type of payment plan or somethin'? Like, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, you know? I just graduated six months ago so you know, times is kinda- times is kinda hard, baby. I- I just- can I just pay you like a lil' bit right now and then I pay you- I pay you the rest next- next month when I get paid. Can I just do somethin' like that? I gotta- I'm not even gon' lie to you, I don't, I don't really have it right now. I gotta pay how much? Five thousand dol- Aw, nigga is you crazy? Bitch you lucky I even answered the phone, I shouldn't have even picked up this motherfucker, I s- Look, what's ya- what's ya name? Can I- can I speak to a manager? You are the manager? Look, look can I speak to yo' manager? Who's- who owns this motherfucker? Let me talk to the owner! God damn it, I ain't- y'all niggas crazy... hahaha

Dollar and a Dream III by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah, hey, Cole world

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

[Bridge]
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a Dream in case she know

[Hook]
That's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, ya'll on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? my fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "Goddamn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, "Bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will
Cole!

[Bridge]
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a dream in case she know

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Outro]
Hey, 'cause nigga that's life, and trust me I'm livin'
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given
Look what a nigga made out
Look what a nigga made out
Got a dollar and a dream

Drank In My Cup Freestyle by J. Cole

[J.Cole]

(Cole World)

[Verse 1]
Now you can choose the easy or hard way
Cole took the long way
A loser car-ley I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jay’s lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC A 'n' T, where I found that TNA
Ain’t seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasn’t nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They waitin' on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappin' in diapers
To rappin' in cyphers
Ta doing more numbers
Then all them fuckin' lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you 'bout to get
Take a bite rock wit it
And I love a bad bitch with confidence
Yo smile nice yo style right
And girl you got some mean thighs
So this right he is mean time
In between time

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Kirko bangz]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Only if you got that sip type
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah

H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup

I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea

Dreams by J. Cole (Ft. Brandon Hines)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, uh, yo
You gotta li—, you gotta follow me
With what I'm doin' right here, mane
Like, when I say this shit is crazy
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'—
Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Aye, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help

Enchanted by J. Cole (Ft. Omen)

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', at least not with us
Might see em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, uh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher and though I never met ya
I'm thinkin' God bless ya, the city tryna get ya

[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you bet your Momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screamin', "We miss ya!"

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, let's see God, I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny?
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery?
My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m trying to get clear, I’m tryna quit fear
Who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no, baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smoke screen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but it's no kings

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they tryna kill ya
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking "God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
Don’t even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the whole season, nigga, no re-runs
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds

[Bridge]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya

[Outro]
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong
'Cause ain't nothing wrong
Im not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass, I gotta ball
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball

​everybody dies by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga

Eyez Freestyle by J. Cole

[Snippet]
(Let me live, let me live, let me live)
Peak in my life, check if you like just what you see
Though you might disagree with my plight
This shit that I write is just like therapeutic for me
There's no shooters for me
Just some niggas that wanna prove to me they down
I rarely bring 'em 'round, cause they still stuck in their ways
Mindstate still the same
Can't help nobody till they ready to change
But I don't give up, I'll be here waiting for you the day you decide that you'll no longer be a slave to your pride
Until then, keep your head on a swivel
For my niggas that dibble, dabble in street life
Hopin' to get a nibble of American pie, equality
An arrogant lie
Told louder by the people that hold power
Listen, this is a setup
I know you feel the rush that niggas get when dollars switch hands
And you can say you got your bread up
But don't be short sighted
See, it's a war that's goin' on outside
Nigga, you got to know about this shit to fight it
I wanna help you through
I'm on the road to sanity with all humanity behind us
Hope they comin' too
These words I spoke are nothin' new
There's nothin' that I [...]
There's nothin' that you cannot do
The truth is right aside of you
Through troubled waters just canoe
Have faith for something greater than to guide you through
These words are for all, me and you

False Prophets by J. Cole

[Intro]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

Farewell by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
Look, some niggas let their dirt out some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade; a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint? Glorify me, over-think?
Say they know me, say I’m great? Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me that they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man

[Hook]
This for them niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a pre-nup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing

[Hook]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go

Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

Foldin Clothes by J. Cole

[Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Bridge]
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright

Folgers Crystals by J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Higher, higher
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Revenge)

[Verse]
Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat Turner in my past life
Bob Marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
Who survived against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
Who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago, the game snatch a nigga’s spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
First thing they do is throw their shade
Word?—errr—I swerve like a Thunderbird on the curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scriptures
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive
Back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "Hello", just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil
You can tell him Cole just sent you now

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah—higher, higher
Yeah, yeah—higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
I can come around, shit, whenever you want
I can come around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
Me, me, me, me, me, me
(Revenge)

Forbidden Fruit by J. Cole (Ft. Kendrick Lamar)

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, took a lil' sip
T-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch

[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Ight, look look, park right here
I'ma be out it'll be like thirty minutes tops
It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let me see that, oh shit what is that some
What's, what the fuck is that platinum
Is that? What's that chain right there
Is that-ss-ss white gold, that's platinum

Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch

For Whom the Bell Tolls by J. Cole

[Intro]
I see the, I see the—
I see the, I see the—
I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

[Verse]
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord

[Chorus]
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

[Outro]
Bells gettin' louder, louder
I see the rain
Pouring down

Freestyle At Kendrick Lamar Concert by J. Cole

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
The game need balance, the game need balance
Woke up this morning to the rumors of niggas wilding
Picture me hating on a young nigga with talent
Album flop, but it's cool, he caked out on his allowance
I was out in Vegas, Kicks was the latest
Bitch was the baddest, her head was the greatest
Only one thing that I ask of you haters
You can't diss a nigga if you got him on your playlist
From straight A's to A-list, Only niggas with AK's can play this
My Jordan's thirteen like eighth grade, You niggas debaters
But you ignoring my pay raise
I made it from 8 dollars an hour, that's 400 a week
To 100 grand a show, that's 400 a week
Ice and wrist, It's Cole summer to keep
Life's a bitch, Just don't cum in the sheets

Freestyle (Hip Hop Nation) by J. Cole

[Verse]
Crack music, nigga...get smacked music, nigga!
Look, you see them ruby red diamonds on my ice
You can call it what you want shit'll prolly change ya life
If you stole it and you pawned it
You should prolly think twice, well connected so I'm on it
Well connected on yo flight, you niggas be writing sonnets writing sonnets
Like we miss you we miss you
Mama go get the tissue
Them things start blastin, Mark Jackson can't assist you
Life cut short like initials, raps or the pistols
One way or another, I'mma uplift you BLAOW!!
You believe me, then you crazy
All these little niggas out here wanna be me but they lazy
Step ya game up get ya name up
Look how I came up
Remember this bitch in high school I liked said I was lame but
I played it off Deep down I was ashamed
But walking through these hallways, all you got is your name
The boy she liked was g-like and very slang
Whips and fresh clothes and so they doing they thang
I ain't good enough
I ain't hood enough
This older nigga stepped up to me at my locker I said put em up ready to jab at
Much to my surprise that nigga backed back
And went about his way
I threw my notebook in my backpack
Walked home just to get my thoughts goin
It’s a hardcore world if they think you soft porn
Niggas will try to fuck you
And steal, rob, or cut you
And we ain't sellin dope but we still gotta hustle
And this that crack music, nigga thatget smacked music, nigga!

[Intro: J. Cole]
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Bridge: J. Cole]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

[Verse: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Outro: J. Cole]
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today

Funkmaster Flex Freestyle (Part 1) by J. Cole (Ft. Funkmaster Flex)

[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
We out here moving, J. Cole is here
This has happened before
When the mics are set up like this
You know something's gonna happen

[Break: J. Cole]
Is it on me?
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
You see us, baby
Funk Flex, J. Cole
Who you mad at, me or yourself

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before "Work Out" I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
HOT 97, baby!!!

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Look
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?

[Break: J. Cole]
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever

Funkmaster Flex Freestyle (Part 2) by J. Cole (Ft. Funkmaster Flex)

[Verse 1]
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this Range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin, I never liked carrots
But now I'm older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar, more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but nowadays more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, I'm all on the Billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga, I could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at Warren Buffett
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a Ford, ironic 'cause I explore
Nigga I explore!

[Verse 2]
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy, I can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If I slip I grab the rail, I'll get a grip and never fail

[Verse 3]
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if I ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga

Funkmaster Flex Freestyle (Part 3) by J. Cole (Ft. Funkmaster Flex)

[Intro]

[Verse]
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that

[Outro]
Nobodies feelings getting hurt, nobody getting mad

Get Away by J. Cole

[Intro: J Cole]
LA, NC, NY
The Chi, yea, hey, yea

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I wake up, hop out the shower spray cologne on while im dressing
They hollering about recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, Im live and breathing so to me that there’s a blessing
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no “F” in
Stepping out today, I got leave the crib
Momma stressing , I pray
That ain't no body gon’ pull the weapon out and spray
Cuz I don’t got no strap
And ever since we hit the depression niggas don't know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya’ll feel the glare I got to go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her
I'm fronting “What's your name?”
She told me, “Boy, you know me, don’t play no games
Now, look, they say you blowing up, hey, is it true, fired up?”
I say, “Girl, they wasn’t kidding like they tubes tied up"

[Hook]
I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me whats work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world
Its just me and my favorite girl, now all around they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay so word is spreading
That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle cuz I know they used to say Jermaine
So who changed?
Whats in name though, when niggas can't hang on-your shoe strings
The flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me?- Im just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real
Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!
This is where they shooting sideways
Boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we high to get away
Now come here ladies see we trynna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon mix it with this Goose, don’t throw it up

[Hook]

Get Free Coleworld by J. Cole (Ft. Major Lazer)

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring him 'round cause her homegirls’ll clown like
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bite size"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about her 5 year plan
She saying “who I’m fooling, they could never understand”
They could never understand

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I’m watching CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep ‘em niggas walking 'round blind all the time
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The single's only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparel
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of all the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates is a nigga fate
And why they call this shit a race
The agony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Bridge: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me

[Outro: 2Pac]
Don't support the Phoneys,Support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talkin about how they so real
And they don't care about our communities?
How can they be talkin about how they're all this you know
The hood and blah blah they don't care about the communities?
You know what I mean? Listen to the words they have in their lyrics
And tell me is that some real shit
And if that's real shit to you
You know what I mean? Listen to what they're saying to you
Don't just bob your head to the beat peep the game
And listen to what I'm saying & hold us accountable for it
