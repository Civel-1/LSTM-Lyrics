[Verse 1]
Look up on the wall
There on the floor
Under the pillow
Behind the door
There's a crack in the mirror
Somewhere there's a hole in a window-pane
Now do you think I'm to blame
Tell me do you think I'm to blame

[Chorus]
(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab)

[Verse 2]
If you're wrappin'
Up the world
Cause you've taken
Someone else's girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Don't you think they'll find out
Tell me don't you think they'll find out

[Chorus]
(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab) doesn't really care

[Bridge]
You want it, you've got it, you've gotta go
You want it, you've got it, now you know

[Verse 3]
It's an illusion
It's a game
A reflection
Of someone else's name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane

Well there's a hole in there somewhere
Yeah there's a hole in there somewhere
Baby there's a hole in there somewhere
Now there's a hole in there somewhere

[Chorus]
(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab)



Look up on the wall, there on the floor
Under the pillow, behind the door
There's a crack in the mirror
Somewhere there’s a hole in a window pane
Now, do you think I'm to blame?
Tell me, do you think I'm to blame?

(When we do it) You’re never there
(When you show it) Just stop and stare
(Abacab) He's in anywhere
(Abacab)

If you're wrappin' up the world
Cause you've taken someone else's girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Don't you think that by now?
Tell me, don't you think that by now?

(When we do it) You’re never there
(When you show it) Just stop and stare
(Abacab) He’s in anywhere
(Abacab) Doesn't really care

You want it? You got it, gotta go
You want it? You got it, now you know

It’s an illusion, it's a game
A reflection of someone else's name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane
Well, there’s a hole in there somewhere
Yeah, there's a hole in there somewhere
Baby, there's a hole in there somewhere
Now, there's a hole in there somewhere

(When we do it) You're never there
(When you show it) You stop and stare
(Abacab) He's in anywhere

(When we do it) You're never there
(When you show it) Just stop and stare
(Abacab) He's in anywhere
(Abacab) Doesn't really care

[Bridge]
You want it? You got it, gotta go
You want it? You got it, now you know

[Verse 3]
It's an illusion, it's a game
A reflection of someone else's name

(feat. Phil Collins)
How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now, cos there's just an empty space
But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face

It's the chance I've gotta take
Take a look at me now

Can't control the quivering inside

[Chorus]

Honey you do me wrong but I'm still crazy about you
I stay away too long and I can't do without you
But every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love grow stronger than before
I know flowers grow through rain
But how can love grow through pain, oh

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiarality

Oh

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby that I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a dog gone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth made love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiarality

I cried so much just like a child that's lost it's toy
But maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
But a child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiarality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar as can be

I don't understand it baby
Don't understand it
Peculiar as can be



I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I heard a cryin' man
Is half a man with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you
I don't mind weepin' if it keeps you by my side

Oh I ain't to proud to beg
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep
All night and day just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
Because I wanna keep ya any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Well I gotta love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to crawl and plead to you baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out that door

Oh I ain't too proud to beg
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to beg, oh you know it
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Fa quello che vuoi, io sono qui
Fai vedere ed imparerò
Se tutto ha un senso
Tu puoi dirmi qual è...
Perché non si finisce mai
Di apprendere, di crescere
Io sono immerso nel mio mondo
Ma io so che fuori c'è dell'altro...
Perché non so come è il mondo
Cosa succede al di fuori di me
Voglio più di un sogno
Appartenere al di fuori di me
E ogni gesto quando io vedo lei
Mi da il sole, mi sento così
Così come mai
Mi son sentito nella vita
Sta succedendo qualcosa in più
E non sulla terra ma un po' più in su
Oltre le nuvole, fra noi
Ora mi oriento un po', sono vivo
Perché non so come è il mondo
Cosa succede al di fuori di me
Voglio più di un sogno
Appartenere al di fuori di me
Stai con me che ti mostrerò
Il mio mondo che tuo sarà
Senti ciò che sento io
Starò... con te
Sto con te
Finalmente lo saprò
Perché non so come è il mondo
Cosa succede al di fuori di me
Voglio più di un sogno
Appartenere al di fuori di me
Perché non so...



[Verse 1]
All of my life, I've been searching
For the words to say how I feel
I'd spend my time thinking too much
And leave too little to say what I mean
But I try to understand the best I can
All of my life
All of my life, I've been saying sorry
For the things I know I should have done
All the things I could have said come back to me
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun
Seems I'm always that little too late
All of my life


[Chorus]
Set 'em up, I'll take a drink with you
Pull up a chair, I think I'll stay
Set 'em up, cos I'm going nowhere
There's too much I need to remember, and there's too much I need to say

[Verse 2]
All of my life, I've been looking
But it's hard to find the way
Just reaching past the goal in front of me
While what's important just slips away
And it doesn't come back, but I'll be looking
All of my life

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All of my life, there have been regrets
That I didn't do all I could
Playing records upstairs, while he watched TV
I didn't spend the time I should
And that's a memory I will live with
All of my life



Dreams will all come true
Being here with you
And time will fly
Caring each day more
Than the day before
Till spring rolls by
And when the springtime has gone
Will my love linger on

'Cause I'll be loving you
Always
With a love that's true
Always
When the things that you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand
Always, always

Days may not be fair
Always
But that's when I'll be there
Always
Not for just an hour
No, no, not for just a day
Not for just a year
Oh but always

Days may not be fair
Always
But that's when I'll be there
Always
Not for just an hour
No, no, not for just a day
Not for just a year
Oh but always

Until forever is through
Until there's just me and you
Always
Oh always



(Instrumental)



[Chorus]
What the hell gives the right to tell me what to do with my
Life?
Especially when you made a mess of every chance you had to
Success
Look at you... Just look at you. I said I'm angry just
Looking at you

[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of sitting back listening to all of
Your clap-trap
If you could get me to take the rap I guarantee
You'd leave me with a backslap
Push me to the left, push me to the right try to take me
Out of the way
Even if you kick me off the edge of the world
You're still going to hear me say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Shouting down again Mahama
Shouting down again[x2]
I can't begin to tell you all the reasons
Why you're making me crazy
I've got so many answers
Like you're stupid, like you're crooked, like you're lazy
Hit me with your left, hit me with your right
Hit me from the top to the toe
Even when you chew me up and spit me out
I'm still going to want to know



[Verse 1]
She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

[Chorus]
Oh think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

[Verse 2]
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

[Chorus]
Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

(Just think about it)

[Bridge]
Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh lord, there must be something you can say

[Verse 3]
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'cos she didn't fit in there

[Chorus]
Oh think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise



[Verse 1]
She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

[Chorus]
Oh think twice
It's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
Just think about it

[Verse 2]
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

[Chorus]
Oh think twice
It's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
Just think about it

[Bridge]
Oh Lord
Is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh Lord
There must be something you can say

[Verse 3]
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
Cause she didn't fit in there

[Chorus]
Oh think twice
It's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
Just think about it

[Outro]
It's just another day for you and me in paradise (paradise)
It's just another day for you and me in paradise (paradise)
It's just another day for you and me in paradise

You know
You decorate the garage wall
Hang in people's halls
Live in secret drawers
If you could look around you
Wonder what you'd see

Fiction
That's all you really are I know
Editorial dreams
They can't make you real
Tell me where you came from
And where you're going to

I won't ever no I'll never get to know her
Or be the cause of anything she does
I won't ever no I'll never get to hold her
Do you think this aching could be love?

You know
You've figured in some fantasies
You would not believe
What you've had to do
Life goes on around you
All because of you

I won't ever no I'll never...

You know
That in twenty years or more
You still look the same
As you do today
You'll still be a young girl
When I'm old and grey

I won't ever no I'll never...



All the pumping's nearly over for my sweet heart
This is the one for me
Time to meet the chef
Oh boy, the running man is out of death
Feel cold and old, it's getting hard to catch my breath

It's back to ash
Now, you've had your flash boy
The rocks, in time compress
Your blood to oil
Your flesh to coal
Enrich the soil
Not everybody's goal

Anyway, they say she comes on a pale horse
But I'm sure I hear a train
Oh boy, I don't even feel no pain
I guess I must be driving myself insane
Damn it all

Does earth plug a hole in heaven
Or heaven plug a hole in earth
How wonderful to be so profound
When everything you are is dying underground

I feel the pull on the rope, let me off at the rainbow
I could have been exploding in space
Different orbits for my bones
Not me, just quietly buried in stones
Keep the deadline open with my maker
See me stretch; for God's elastic acre
The doorbell rings and its
"Good morning Rael
So sorry you had to wait
It won't be long, yeah
She's very rarely late"



Instrumental



[Instrumental]



Baby don't you cry no more, no more
Baby don't you cry no more
I been a lot of trouble
But I won't no more
Baby don't you cry, no baby don't you cry no more
I'm listening to that midnight whistle blow
Just listening to that whistle blow
And come tomorrow morning
I'll be leaving on a train
Listening to that whistle blow
I confess to being a fool
Bled your heart
And did you cruel
So I'll leave you with your eyes closed
And your head turned from the door
And you won't have to cry no more
Walk away, sad to say, it's grown thin
Love is cold when it's old
You can hold on too long
So wipe away the sate tear
From your eye so red and sore
Baby don't you cry no more
Baby don't you cry, no baby don't you cry no more



I see faces and traces of home
Back in New York City, you're home

So you think I'm a tough kid, is that what you heard?
Well, I like to see some action and it gets into my blood
They call me the trail blazer, Rael electric razor
I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain

'Cos we're only as strong
'Cos we're only as strong
As the weakest link in the chain

Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me
If you know what I mean, what I mean

You say, I must be crazy, 'cos I don't care who I hit, who I hit
But I know it's me that's hitting out, and I'm, I'm not full of shit
I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong
This is your mess, I'm stuck in, I really don't belong

When I take out my bottle filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where Rael has been, has been

As I cuddled the porcupine
He said, I had none to blame, but me
Held my heart, deep in hair
Time to shave, shave it off, it off

No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
Off we go, off we go, off we go, off we go

You're sitting in your comfort, you don't believe I'm real
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash

And I've tasted all the strongest meats
And laid them down on colored sheets
Laid them down on colored sheets

Who needs illusion of love and affection
When you're out walking in the streets
With your mainline connection, connection

As I cuddle the porcupine
He said, I had none to blame, but me
Held my heart, deep in hair
Time to shave, shave it off, it off

No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape, no
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No time



Back it up, gotta back it up
You know I said you just talk, talk, talk
But can you back it up

Seen through the eyes of a stranger
Running your mouth is a danger
To yourself and everybody else (everybody else, don't)
Don't say that I never told you
I can't take your word; that just won't do
It's hit or miss, I'll tell you this
Now put your money where your mouth is

You gotta back it up, back it up
Gotta back it up, you know I've had enough
I said you just talk, talk, talk, but can you back it up

Now, now, after all is said and done
I'll lay the odds, make it two to one
Your number is past, you won't make it last
(You won't last long)
Now you keep hittin' ten the hard way
Double or nothing you can't stay
Talk is cheap, and oohwee
Are you gettin' in too deep

You gotta back it up, back it up
Gotta back it up, you know I've had enough
I said you just talk, talk, talk, but can you back it up
You gotta back it up, back it up
Gotta back it up, you know I've had enough
Enough, I said you just talk, talk, talk, but can you back it up

You know that talk is cheap
You're chokin' on words you can't keep
Now are you feeling weak?

You gotta back it up, back it up
Gotta back it up, you know I've had enough
Enough I'm saying; talk, talk, talk, but can you back it up
You gotta back it up, back it up
Gotta back it up, you know I've had enough
Enough I'm saying; talk, talk, talk, but can you back it up
You gotta back it up, back it up
Gotta back it up, you know I've had enough
Enough, I said you just talk, talk, talk, but can you back it up
You gotta back it up, back it up
Gotta back it up, you know I've had enough



[Verse 1]
Oh, what a feeling I get when I'm with you
You take my heart into everything you do
And it makes me sad for the lonely people
I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong

[Chorus]
I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

[Verse 2]
And now I see that my life has been so blue
With all the heartaches I had until I met you
But I'm glad to say now that is all behind me
With you here by my side
And there is no more memories to remind me
Your love will keep me alive

[Chorus][x3]



Big Jim Cooley commanded respect
Whatever he wanted he could get
The badge on his waistcoat shone in the sun
It ain't no lie, Big Jim was feared by everyone

In the saloon one evening Big took a bet
With a rancher whose name I forget
He wanted a herd taken over the plain
And he called Jim "yellow", he'll never do that again

He got mad!
He threw his badge on the floor and walked out
He's gonna give it a try, he left no doubt

"Must be mad, he must be mad!"
The people wished him well, and good luck
"Hell, I don't need it!" he laughed
Got on his horse and rode away

Out on the trail, Jim 'n' his crew of five
Were trying their best to keep the cattle alive
The weather was hard, but so were the men
Though I don't think even Big will try this trip again

His horses were edgy, sensing trouble ahead
But the trouble didn't start till the men were in bed
A-whooping and a-hollering and flashing their knives
Big and his men were jumped by an all-star Indian tribe

He was scared, Big Jim was scared
Alive, they called him lucky, but not today
'Cos he died like all good cowboys
With his boots on next to his men

Big Jim, he still won't lie down
For him the bet is still on
Some say he rides there
Cursing still, some say they've seen him



I held the book so tightly in my hands, saw your picture, heard you call my name
There was something strange, I could not look away
I wanted to be there, I wanted to go

You gave me no warning
You gave no reason
But I was with you
Right by your side
Give me the strength, and I will help you
They can try their hardest, they don't frighten me

It is written in the book

It is hotter than I've known before, but I feel so cold, and I don't know why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Then I really believe, you could make it right

The time has come now
We must show our feelings
But I'm looking right through you
And your heart is empty

Whatever happened to you it's too late to change now
There's nowhere you can run to, no place to hide
Oh you let me down!

...but wait a minute, I don't understand
It's getting stronger, grab my hand
Don't wanna leave you, don't wanna go
But I'm losing all control
Can't you see me slipping away?
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here

It is written in the book

Oh so many times since I've read those words
Just waiting to see you, can you see me?



[Verse]
I held the book so tightly in my hands
I saw your picture, heard you call my name
It was strange I could not look away
I had to be there, I wanted to go
You gave me no reason
You gave me no warning
But I was with you
By your side
Give me the strength, so I can help you
And I can be strong now, they don't frighten me
It's written in the book
The sun is hotter than before
But inside it's cold, I wonder why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Well I believe we can make it right
It's time now
To show our feelings
Looking through you
Your heart's empty
Whatever happened to you, you can't change it
Nowhere to run to, please, oh please don't let me down
But wait a minute I don't understand
It's getting stronger, hold my hand
Don't want to leave you I don't want to go
But I'm a' losing all control
Can't you see me I'm slipping away
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here
Oh Lord
It's written in the book
I held the book so tightly in my hands
Saw your picture, heard you call my name
Oh, and even though we never, never touched
I keep waiting for you just the same

[Outro]
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la...



I held the book so tightly in my hands, saw your picture, heard you call my name

Right by your side
Just give me the strength, and I will help you
They can try their hardest, cause they don't frighten me

Aw, it's written in the book

Tell me can you see me? Oh!



[Verse 1]
All along, had to talk about it
Like a two-edged sword, it cuts you and it stabs me
All along, knew you were a phony girl
Sit behind the mask, where you control your world

Yesterday, he had you in his arms
When I'm holding you, I feel his bitter charms
I can't judge what you do to me
Camouflage the truth, indulge your fantasy

[Chorus]
Who do you love? Is it me, now? Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe? Is it him, now? I don't know

[Verse 2]
There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind
There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind

Was I invited to your masquerade?
Well the party's over, so now take off your face
You say you love, but it's hard to see
When you're in his arms, throwing rocks at me

[Chorus]
Who do you love? Is it me, now? Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe? Is it him, now? I don't know

[Verse 3]
I walk around suffering in my gloom
When I come to you sitting in your room
The truth is news, I have longed to trace
So take off the mask so I can see your face

[Chorus]
Who do you love? Is it me, now? Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe? Is it him, now? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, now? Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe? Is it him, now? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, now? Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe? Is it him, now? I don't know

[Outro]
Who do you love? Is it me, baby? Is it him? I want to know
Who do you love?



[Verse]
My love has gone behind the sun
Since she left, the darkness has begun
The smile that used to shine on me
Is nothing more than a memory

I see her face, I hear her voice
She made her move, I had no choice
But walk and cry, wipe tears with my hand
The one that carries a wedding band

And the clouds hang low
And the flowers that used to grow
In my heart
Are dying now, dying now

[Outro]
Dying now

[Chorus]
Just set your sight high, look
Them right in the eye and take it
And make a big big big noise
Don't ask why
Just take it wise and making it
Make that a big big big big noise

[Verse 1]
You can feel it in the air
Feel it everywhere
There's a spirit moving
At just look, it's all around you
Just take a look around you people stars?? To loose it
Cos if you wanted you gotta go get it
Just to listen up
If there`s something that you need
You better believe

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Better make your play
Don't let her thing like right or wrong, get it

You better believe

[Chorus]

Just to listen up
If there's something that you need
You better believe

[Verse 1]
Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away
Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it
Oh yes, my love has gone astray

[Chorus]
But I'll blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees

[Verse 2]
I'll blame it on the time that never was enough
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea
But, my heart blames it on me
Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?
Wish I could tell you
What I am feeling
But, words won't come for me to speak

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be
But, my heart blames it on me
Yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh
Your heart blames it on you this time



[Verse 1]
Dark and grey, an English film, the Wednesday Play
We always watch the Queen on Christmas Day
Won't you stay?

Though your eyes see shipwrecked sailors you're still dry
The outlook's fine though Wales might have some rain
Saved again

[Chorus 1]
Let's skip the news boy (I'll go and make some tea)
Arabs and Jews boy (too much for me)
They get me confused boy (puts me off to sleep)
And the thing I hate--Oh Lord!
Is staying up late, to watch some debate, on some nation's fate

[Verse 2]
Hypnotised by Batman, Tarzan, still surprised!
You've won the West in time to be our guest
Name your prize!

Drop of wine, a glass of beer dear what's the time?
The grime on the Tyne is mine all mine all mine
Five past nine

[Chorus 2]
Blood on the rooftops--Venice in the Spring
The Streets of San Francisco--a word from Peking
The trouble was started--by a young Errol Flynn
Better in my day--Oh Lord!
For when we got bored, we'd have a world war, happy but poor
So let's skip the news boy (I'll go and make some tea)
Blood on the rooftops (too much for me)
When old Mother Goose stops--and they're out for 23
Then the rain at Lords stopped play
Seems Helen of Troy has found a new face again



[Verse 1]
Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

[Chorus 1]
We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

[Verse 2]
A neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says "looks like it's just us from now on"

[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story
We need to hear both sides of the story

[Chorus 2]
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you hear both sides

[Verse 3]
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the center of the storm
Neighbors once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat

[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story

[Chorus 2]
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you see both sides

[Verse 4]
White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall
He says "Would you respect me if I didn't have this gun"
"Because without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one"

[Outro]
We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Oh, both sides of the story
Yes, both sides of the story
Oh, both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Must hear both sides of the story



[Instrumental]

Echoes off the Broadway Everglades
With our mythical Madonnas still walking in their shades
Lenny Bruce declares a truce, and plays his other hand
Marshall McLuhan casual viewing, head buried in the sand
Sirens on the rooftops wailing, but there's no ship sailing
Groucho with his movies trailing, stands alone with his punchline failing

Ku Klux Klan serving hot soul food, and the band plays "In the Mood"
A cheerleader waves a cyanide wand, there's a smell of peach blossom and bitter almond
Caryl Chessman sniffs the air and leads the parade
He knows, in a scent, you can bottle all you made

There's Howard Hughes in blue suede shoes
Smiling at the majorettes and smoking Winston cigarettes
And as the song and dance begins, the children play at home
With needles, needles and pins



You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls



[Verse 1]
I've been doing some thinking, here on my own
It's been on my mind
This debt i owe to you
I have to repay in kind

[Chorus]
But i can't find my way
I can't find my way
Can't seem to find my way
I can't find my way

[Verse 2]
Tired and weary, i follow the path
That leads to your door
But it occurred to me, all that i have
Is already yours

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, just to sit a while
Oh, just to sit and watch you smile

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Keep the faith you say
To keep the faith i pray
Well be strong you say
Just follow the light
Wheels keep turning but the close i get
The farther i seem
Peace will only come
Finding the peace within

[Chorus]



I need love, love
Ooh, to ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine
My mama said..

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said...
You can't hurry love
No you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

How long must I wait
And how much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well, these precious words keep me hanging on
I remember mama said...

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
Well, it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes, now break

Now love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms hold me tight

I keep waiting, ooh, till that day
But it ain't easy (love don't come easy)
No, you know it ain't easy
My mama said...

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait



[Verse 1]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Verse 2]
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Bridge]
(Even try) I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) I'm always here if you change, change your mind

[Verse 3]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?



[Verse 1: Phil Collins]
Could've given you everything that you need
But I cannot turn back the years
The perfect love was all you wanted from me
But I cannot turn back the years

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth
And when I look deep down inside I know, it's too bad I love you
Too bad I love you

[Verse 2: Phil Collins]
Sometimes hits me in the morning, hits me at night
That I cannot turn back the years
So I look out my window, turn off my light
But I cannot turn back the years
Can't make it seem easy, when you're all that I see
Can't live in a dream and I won't serenade the truth
People are hurting and they're looking to me
And I look at you there's nothing more to say, it's too bad I love you

[Bridge: Phil Collins]
But I'm never going to (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No i love you and I'm never going to (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
I'll keep holding on to you (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
And i'm never going to give it up
(Give it up, give it up)

[Verse 3: Phil Collins]
All that I lived for, all that I dreamed
But I cannot turn back the years
You're the water I drink, you're the air that I breathe
But I cannot turn back the years

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth
And when I look deep down inside I know, it's too bad I love you

[Outro: Phil Collins]
But I'm never gonna (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No, no, no never gonna (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
It's here to stay and I'm never gonna (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
Never gonna give it up, never gonna (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No I'm never gonna give it up
Never  gonna give it up (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No I'm never gonna give it up (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
You know you mean too much to me



[Verse 1]
The scattered pages of a book
By the sea
Held by the sand, washed by the waves

A shadow forms
Cast by a cloud
Skimming by
As eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them
Effortlessly claiming

[Verse 2]
They told of one who tired of all
Singing "Praise him, praise him"
"We heed not flatterers" he cried

"By our command
Waters retreat
Show my power
Halt at my feet"
But the cause was lost, now cold winds
Blow

[Verse 3]
Far from the north
Overcast ranks advance
Fear of the storm
Accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne
Singing "Crown him, crown him"

"Those who love
Our majesty
Show themselves!"
All bent their knee

Aahh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
But he forced a smile even though his hopes
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
"Nothing can
My peace destroy
As long as none smile"

More opened ears
And opened eyes
And soon they dared to laugh

See a little man with his face turning red
Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead



[Verse 1]
There is lambswool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries
Into flame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures
Are trapped in birth on celluloid

The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping they'll find peace
Each thought and gesture
Are caught in celluloid
There's no hiding in my memory
There's no room to avoid

[Verse 2]
The crawlers cover the floor
In the red ochre corridor
For my second sight of people
They've more lifeblood than before
They're moving in time
To a heavy wooden door
Where the needles eye is winking
Closing in on the poor

[Refrain]
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

[Verse 3]
There's only one direction in the faces that I see;
It's upward to the ceiling, where the chambers said to be
Like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree
They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they're free

[Refrain]
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

[Verse 4]
Mild mannered supermen are held in kryptonite
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright
Through the door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight;
It's the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight

[Refrain]
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

[Verse 5]
The porcelain mannequin with shattered skin fears attack
The eager pack lift up their pitchers, they carry all they lack
The liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack
And the tickler takes his stickleback

[Refrain]
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

[Outro]
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

The carpet crawlers heed their callers
"We've got to get in to get out"



[Peter Gabriel]
There is lamb's wool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries into flame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures are trapped in birth on celluloid
The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping they'll find peace
Each thought and gesture are caught in celluloid
There's no hiding in my memory
There's no room to avoid

The crawlers cover the floor
In the red ocher corridor
For my second sight of people
They've more life blood than before
They're moving in time to a heavy wooden door
Where the needle's eye is winking
Closing on the poor
The carpet crawlers heed their callers

We've gotta get in to get out (x3)

There's only one direction
In the faces that I see
It's upward to the ceiling
Where the chamber's said to be
Like the forest fight for sunlight
That takes root in every tree
They are pulled up by the magnet
Believing they're free
The carpet crawlers heed their callers

We've gotta get in to get out (x3)

[Phil Collins]
Mild-mannered supermen
Are held in kryptonite
And the wise and foolish virgins
Giggle with their bodies glowing bright
Through the door a harvest feast
Is lit by candlelight
It's the bottom of a staircase
That spirals out of sight
The carpet crawlers...

[Together]
Heed their callers
We've gotta get in to get out (x3)
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
We've gotta get in to get out (x2)

We've got to get in to get out (x8)

[Peter Gabriel]
We've got to get in to get out (x2)



Children of the ghetto
Runnin' wild and free
In the concrete jungle
Filled with misery
There's no inspiration
To brighten up their day
So out of desperation
I would like to say

Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky

Children of the ghetto
Are always in the news
Toughness is their moto
And bitter are their blues
But deep inside the ghetto
There's a unity
Their councils are for sorrows
And no misery

Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky
To the sky

God's your inspiration
To brighten up your day
Don't you know
So better consolation
I would like to say

Children of the Ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky

Saved with me
There's so many children
Keep your head up
Keep it
Keep it up
Saved with me
There's so many children
Keep your heard up
Keep it
Keep it up

Don't you know
Everything
Is gonna be alright
If you just
Keep it up
Keep it up
Keep it up
Everything
Surely is gonna be alright
If you just
Keep it up



You lie over there in a bed with iron rails
Like a frightened child in the cold light, so frail
Things were going so well, just rolling along
Now, just when you think you got it all made
You think it's all gone

China Doll, I've got something for you
A few good words, a hand to help you get through
May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
Lay down your weary head
Do whatever you gotta do

Put on your strong face when they're in the room
Can't show signs of weakness; an unspoken rule
Put on your strong face, act like nothing's wrong
We can be so helpless, helpless and so strong

China Doll, I've got something for you
A few good words, a hand to help you get through
May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
To ease your worried mind
Do something to get through

We bend and break, so fragile, it's true
I say everything'll be all right, but I don't have a clue
They say faith is a crutch, well, whatever works for you
In a world where you never know
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you ...

China Doll, I've got something for you
A few good words, a hand to help you get through
May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
Lay down your weary head
Do whatever you gotta do



[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
Deep inside the border
Children are crying
Fighting for food
Holding their heads
Breaking their bread with a stone

All along the roadside
People are standing
Watching the sun
Shielding their eyes
Brushing the flies from their face

[Chorus 1]
Tell me, what can you say
Tell me, who do you blame
Like a mirror you see yourself
These people each have a name

[Verse 2]
All around the township
Young men are dying
(of) hunger and thirst
The well has run dry
The tears from her eye feeds her son

[Chorus 1]
Tell me, what can you say
Tell me, who do you blame
Like a mirror you see yourself
These people each have a name

[Studio Version: Instrumental]
[Live Version: Drum Duet (Collins & Thompson)]

[Verse 3]
You can say you're pulling back
We see the pictures everywhere
But what we don't see is what's
Going on behind the closed doors
And you don't seem to care

Do you expect me to believe you
How can you really think
You can take your horse down to the water
Hold a gun at his head
And make him drink

[Chorus 2]
No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change

[Verse 4]
People living without rights
Without their dignity
How loud does one man have to shout
To earn his right to be free

You can keep your toy soldiers
To segregate the black and white
But when the dust settles
And the blood stops running
How do you sleep at night?

[Chorus 2]
No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change
No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change

[Verse 5]
What makes you so high and mighty
What makes you so qualified
You can sit there and say
How many have their freedom
But how many more have died

You decide to sit in judgement
Trying to play God yourself
Someday soon the buck is gonna stop
Stop with you and no one else

[Chorus 2]
No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change
No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change

[Studio Version ends with short Instrumental]
[Live Version ends with another Drum Duet (Collins & Thompson)]



[Verse 1]
I'll try to make the sun shine brighter for you
I will even play the fool if it makes you smile
I'll try to make you laugh if there's a tear in your eye
After all is said
After all is done
I'd do anything for you

[Chorus]
Come with me, close your eyes
Hold my hand, it'll be alright
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Lift your head it's going to be alright

[Verse 2]
I'll try to make the stars shine brighter for you
And I'll take you on my shoulders, hold you way up high
I'll even chase the rainbow hanging in the sky
Because after all is said
After all is done
I'd do anything for you

[Chorus]
Come with me, close your eyes
Hold my hand, it'll be alright
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Lift your head it's going to be alright

[Verse 3]
Through the eyes of innocence
You will find, you will see
There'll come a time it all makes sense
And you won't know, but it will show inside, deep inside

[Chorus]
Come with me, close your eyes
Hold my hand, it'll be alright
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Lift your head it's going to be alright

[Verse 4]
I'll try to make the days last longer for you
From the daybreak, 'til the sunset, 'til the end of time
I'll keep you safe, away from the heartache
Because when all is said
And when all is done
I'd do anything for you

[Chorus]
Come with me, close your eyes
Hold my hand, it'll be alright
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Lift your head it's going to be alright



Lock me in the corner
Pull the blinds, the moon won’t last
Drag me to the bottom of your secrets
Let the walls come down on me
And it’s been too long
And i don’t have much
But the war rolls on
And it’s all i ever think about
Drown me in the water
Pull the blinds, the rain won’t last
Drag me to the bottom of your reasons
Let the walls come down on me
And the war rolls inside of my head
And it’s cause baby you’re not there
It’s all right, i don’t mind it
Tell me little sister
Tell me do you think you can ride it?



I'm counting out time
Got the whole thing down by numbers
All those numbers!
Give me guidance!
O Lord I need that now

The day of judgement's come
And you can bet that I've been resting
For this testing
Digesting every word the experts say
Erogenous zones I love you
Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Found a girl I wanted to date
Thought I'd better get it straight
Went to buy a book before it's too late
Don't leave nothing to fate
I studied every line, every page in the book
Now, I've got the real thing here, I'm gonna take a look, take a look

(This is it Rael)

I'm counting out time, hoping it goes like I planned it
'cos I understand it. Look! I've found the hotspots, Figures 1-9
Still counting out time, got my finger on the button
Don't say nuttin - just lie there still
And I'll get you turned on just fine
Erogenous zones I love you
Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Touch and go with 1-6
Bit of trouble in zone No. 7
Gotta remember all of my tricks
There's heaven ahead in No. 11
Getting crucial responses, dilation of the pupils
Honey get hip! It's time to unzip, to unzip, zip, zip-a-zip-a-zip
Whipee!
(Take it away Mr. Guitar)
(Move over Casanova)

I'm counting out time, reaction none to happy
Please don't slap me
I'm a red blooded male and the book said I could not fail
I'm counting out time, I got unexpected distress from my mistress
I'll get my money back from the bookstore right away
Erogenous zones I question you
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Without you, mankind handkinds through the blues



[Verse 1]
Wrapped up in some powdered wool
I guess I'm losing touch
Don't tell me this is dying
Cause I ain't changed that much
The only sound is water drops
I wonder where the hell I am
Some kind of jam?

Cuckoo cocoon, have I come to, too soon for you?

[Verse 2]
There's nothing I can recognize; this is nowhere that I've known
With no sign of life at all, I guess that I'm alone
And I feel so secure that I know this can't be real
But I feel good

Cuckoo cocoon have I come to, too soon for you?

[Verse 3]
I wonder if I'm a prisoner locked in some Brooklyn jail
Or some sort of Jonah shut up inside the whale
No I'm still Rael and I'm stuck in some kind of cave
What could've saved me?

Cuckoo cocoon have I come to, too soon for you?



[Verse 1: Phil Collins]
It's there in the eyes of the children
In the faces smiling in the windows
You can come on out, come on open the doors
Brush away the tears of freedom

[Chorus 1: Phil Collins]
Now we're here, there's no turning back
We have each other
We have one voice

[Chorus 2: Phil Collins]
Hand in hand we will lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home

[Chorus 3: Phil Collins]
Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light

[Verse 2: Phil Collins]
There'll be no more hiding in shadows of fear
There'll be no more chains to hold you
The future is yours - you hold the key
And there are no walls with freedom

[Chorus 1: Phil Collins]
Now we're here, we won't go back
We have one world
We have one voice

[Chorus 2: Phil Collins]
Side by side we are not afraid
Because the train is coming to carry you home

[Chorus 3: Phil Collins]
Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light

[Verse 3: Phil Collins]
Do you see the sun - it's a brand new day
Oh, the world's in your hands, now use it
What's past is past, don't turn around
Brush away the cobwebs of freedom

[Chorus 1: Phil Collins]
Now we're here, there's no turning back
You have each other
You have one voice

[Chorus 2: Phil Collins]
Hand in hand you can lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home

[Chorus 3: Phil Collins]
Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light
Come on and dance into the light
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody
Dance into the light
Dance
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody
Come on and dance into the light, into the light
Everybody dance into the light
Everybody
Everybody dance into the light, into the light, into the light



It's there in the eyes of the children
In the faces smiling in the windows
You can come on out, come on open the doors
Brush away the tears of freedom
Now we're here, there's no turning back
We have each other
We have one voice
Hand in hand we will lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home
Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light
There'll be no more hiding in shadows of fear
There'll be no more chains to hold you
The future is yours - you hold the key
And there are no walls with freedom
Now we're here, we won't go back
We are one world
We have one voice
Side by side we are not afraid
Because the train is coming to carry you home
Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light
Do you see the sun - it's a brand new day
Oh, the world's in your hands, now use it
What's past is past, don't turn around
Brush away the cobwebs of freedom
Now we're here, there's no turning back
You have each other
You have one voice
Hand in hand you can lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home
Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light



Holy mother of god
Youve got to go faster than that to get to the top
Dirty old mountain
All covered in smoke, she can turn you to stone
So you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right

You're halfway up and youre halfway down
And the pack on your back is turning you around
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember
You dont look back whatever you do
Better start doing it right

On your left and on your right
Crosses are green and crosses are blue
Your friends didn't make it through
Out of the night and out of the dark
Into the fire and into the fight
Well that's the way the heroes go, ho! ho! ho!

Through a crack in mother earth
Blazing hot, the molten rock
Spills out over the land
And the lavas the lover who licks your boots away. hey! hey! hey!
If you dont want to boil as well
B-b-better start the dance
D-d-do you want to dance with me?

You better start doing it right

The music's playing, the notes are right
Put your left foot first and move into the light
The edge of this hill is the edge of the world
And if youre going to cross you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right

You better start doing it right

Let the dance begin

"Can you tell me where my country lies?"
Said the unifaun to his true love's eyes
"It lies with me!" cried the Queen of Maybe
For her merchandise, he traded in his prize

"Paper late!" cried a voice in the crowd
"Old man dies!" The note he left was signed 'Old Father Thames'
It seems he's drowned
Selling England by the pound

Citizens of Hope & Glory
Time goes by, it's the time of your life
Easy now, sit you down
Chewing through your Wimpey dreams
They eat without a sound
Digesting England by the pound

Young man says "you are what you eat," eat well
Old man says "you are what you wear," wear well
You know what you are, you don't give a damn
Bursting your belt that is your homemade sham

The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
Join the dance
Follow on 'til the Grail sun sets in the mould
Follow on 'til the gold is cold
Dancing out with the moonlit knight
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shout

There's a fat old lady outside the saloon
Laying out the credit cards she plays Fortune
The deck is uneven right from the start
And all of their hands are playing apart

The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
Join the dance
Follow on, a Round Table-talking down we go
You're the show, off we go with
You play the hobbyhorse
I'll play the fool
We'll tease the bull
Ringing round diddle loud, loud diddle round
Follow on with a twist of the world we go
Follow on 'til the gold is cold
Dancing out with the moonlit knight
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shout



Tarzan
It?s just like me yet
It?s just so different
Where did it come from?
These things that got here
Are all so different
Where does it belong?

I?ve never seen its shape
It?s just so different
Oh I must see more
Skin so soft
It smells so different
From all I?ve seen before
And yet here, we?re just the same

My heart is beating faster
I must know more about her
There?s something strange that draws me near her
She?s nothing like I?ve seen before
She makes me feel so alive

Tarzan

Jane
Tarzan Oh I see

Tarzan
Tarzan Oh I see

Jane
Oh nononono, I'm Jane

Tarzan
Oh nononono, I'm Jane

Jane
Oh dear, no, My name is Jane Porter

Tarzan
Oh dear, no, My name is Jane Porte..

Jane
STOP
Tarzan, Jane

Tarzan
Tarzan, Jane

Jane
Exactly

Tarzan
I've never felt like this
I feel so different
Being so close to her
Something deep inside feels so different
Since everything has stirred
There?s something so exciting
Somehow more so inviting
It feels so new yet so familiar
Something tells me I will never
Ever be the same again



Dir gehört mein Herz:
Hör auf zu weinen und nimm meine Hand
Halt sie ganz fest, keine Angst
Egal was kommen mag, ich bin bei dir
Denk nur an mich, keine Angst

Sie wollen nicht mit unsren Augen sehn
Vertrauen nicht, was sie nicht verstehen
Wir sind verschieden, doch unsre Herzen
Sind nicht verschieden, sondern eins!

Denn mir gehört mein Herz
Ja dir gehört mein Herz
Von heute an, für alle Ewigkeit
Dir gehört mein Herz
Und bist du hier bei mir
Und ich auch ewig hier
Bei dir

Bist du bei mir, dann bin ich stark
In meinen Armen halt dich schön warm
Von nun an sind wir unzertrennlich
Bin für dich hier. Keine Angst

Dir gehört mein Herz
Nun bist du hier bei mir
Denn dir gehört mein Herz. Nur dir

Und folge dem Schicksal, das micht dich stark
Denn bin ich nicht bei dir, brauchst du all deine Kraft
So wird es sein
Ja wohl. Wir schaffen zusammen

Denn dir gehört mein herz
Glaub mir, dir gehört mein Herz
Ich bin da. Von heute an. Für deine Ewigkeit

Dir gehört mein Herz (Dir gehört es, ja dir)
Und bist du hier bei mir (Ohhh, du bist bei mir)
Dir gehört mein Herz
Es gehört nur dir. Nur dir

Oh ja, ich will für dich da sein
Für immer und ewig
Und ich bleibe dann bei dir
Ja, ich bleibe dann bei dir
Glaube mir
Ja, ich bleibe dann bei dir
Auf ewig hier, bei dir



[Go the Distance]
I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome
Would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know ev'ry mile
Will be worth my while
When I go the distance
I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road
To embrace my fate
Though the road may wander
It will lead me to you
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track
No, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance
And my journey is complete

[You'll Be In My Heart]
Come stop your crying, it will be all right
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here don't you cry

And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

Don't listen to them, cause what do they know
We need each other, to have and to hold
They'll see in time, I know

When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you, but you gotta hold on
They'll see in time, I know

Well, show them together cuz...

You'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always

[Reflection]
Look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see that if I were to truly to be myself
I would break my family's heart

Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide who I am
Though I've tried
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?

How I pray
That a time will come I can free myself
And meet their expectations
On that day
I'll discover some way to free myself, and to make my family proud

They want a docile lamb, no one knows who I am
Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else, for all time
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?



Too big to fly, dodo ugly so dodo must die
Dog go with fear on its side, can't change, can’t change the tide
Dog baiter, agitator, keeps asking questions, says he wants to know why
Aw there ain't no reason that money can't buy
Aw mink he pretty, so mink he must die, must die

Must die

Sun he giving life in his light
It’s part of the system
Friend to man, friend to the trees
No friend to the snowman
But where does he go and what does he do?
Does he meet with the mole, the stream, the cloud
And end up at the bottom of the sea

Fish he got a hook in his throat
Fish he got problems
But where does he go and what does he do?
Does he think he's too small, to poor a haul
Who'll end up being thrown back in the sea
I'm back in the sea

Caretaker, horror movie
Only one eye, only needs one boot
Aw sweet lady, she knows she looks good
The Vacuum coming for the bright and the brute

Big noise, black smoke
He's so pig-headed couldn't see the joke
Aw but it ain't funny
Ask the fly on the wall
It's only living
It don’t matter at all, at all

At all

Pimp, he make you drool and grunt
Well he’s got an answer
One he got a dream of love
It's deep as the ocean
Ocean, ocean, ocean

But where does he go?
And what does he do?
And the siren team with Davy Jones
And end up at the bottom of the sea

I’m back in the sea
I'm back in the sea

I'm back, in the sea!

Meanwhile lurking by a stone in the mud
Two eyes looked to see what I was and
Then something spoke and this is what
It said to me.......

Clothes of brass and hair of brown
Seldom need to breathe
Don't need no wings to fly
Ooh and a heart of stone
And a fear of fire and water
Who am I?

Clothes of brass and hair of brown
Seldom need to breathe
Don’t need no wings to fly
And a heart of stone
And a fear of fire and water
Who am I?

[Verse 1]
You keep on walking so you don't fall down
It's the same old story
You keep on hiding so you can't be found
It's the same old story

[Chorus]
Oh but I know you, you're the one who ran
You know why, it's because you can, oh
It's alright, because I don't mind
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore[x2]

[Verse 2]
My friends keep falling and they can't get up
It's the same old story
Well one says white and the other one black
It's the same old story
And I don't know why you keep emotions walled up
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Things can change, from a misunderstanding
Nobody talks, nobody hears, oh oh oh
Makes me wonder why

[Verse 3]
You keep on looking for that higher ground
It's the same old story
Your glass is empty and the chips are down
It's the same old story
Oh but I know you, you're the one who ran
You know why, it's because you can, oh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Oh I wonder why



[Verse 1]
Here I am on bended knees
I lay my heart down at your feet
Now do I love you

[Verse 2]
All you have to do is ask
I'll give until there's nothing left
Do I love you

As long as there is life in me
Your happiness is guaranteed
I'll fill your heart with ecstasy, forever darling

[Chorus]
Do I love you?[X3]
Indeed I do Indeed I do

[Verse 3]
The very thing that I want most
Is just to have and hold you close
Do I love you?

From early morning until late at night
You fill my heart with pure delight
Do I love you?

[Verse 4]
Whenever I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
And bring you home safe to me, for ever darling

[Chorus][X3]
Do I love you?

[Verse 5]
Indeed I do, sweet darling, indeed I do

Now whenever I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
And bring you home safe to me
For ever darling

[Chorus]
Do I love you?[X3]
Indeed I do, little darling, indeed I do



Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will

[Verse 1]
Don't get me started on politicians
And the lies they spread
Don't even mention sex and religion
And who they take to bed
But if you see me running down the street
Know where I'm running to
I'm tired of honesty being denied us
I'm coming looking for you

[Chorus]
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way
And nothing's gonna turn me round
Don't turn around, give it to me straight
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me
I'll hold my ground
Wild horses won't make me

[Verse 2]
Don't get me started on information
Magazines and T.V
There's one man under his big umbrella
While it's raining on you and me
Everyday it's getting harder to judge
Fiction from fact
I'm tired of truth being denied me
It's mine and I want it back

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Business as usual in our pressure steamer
Where reality slips from view
They say that we can't take it
I think I can, can you?

[Verse 3]
Don't get me started on blood and thunder
With people flying blind
Not caring what or who they take with them
Or what they leave behind
It's one mans god against another
While the river of tears roll by
The things they do in the name of their father
Can someone tell me why

[Chorus]



You were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to tell you it'll all work out all right

Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away
Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

You can look at him the way you did me
And hold him close say you're never letting go
But any fool can see you're fooling yourself
But you ain't fooling me

So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of the wall
Oh, did you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right

'Cos I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely
But hoping you could be strong
But can you look at me straight
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong?

So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

Well he's gonna try to make it work for you
Make you think your whole life's been leading to this
But whatever you do
Think about me, oh! and don't be fooled by his kiss

And don't let him steal your heart away
Please, don't let him steal your heart away

And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of your wall
Oh, did you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right
You know I'm right

'Cause you were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to say don't you worry it'll all be alright
But he's no good for you
He'll make you think your whole life's been leading to this
And whatever you do
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss



[Intro]
You were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile

[Chorus 1][x2]
Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

But you ain't fooling me

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off a' the wall

Don't let him change a thing Because I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right

[Verse 2]
Because I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely
But hoping you could be strong
But could you look at me straight
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong?

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]

And whatever you do
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss



If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place
(You can't run, you can't hide, you can't run, you can't hide)
Love has problems I know but they're problems, we'll just have to face
Oh yeah, yeah
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walkin' don't look back. (Don't look back)
And don't look back. (Don't look back)
And don't look back, baby. (Don't look back)
(The past is behind you, let nothing remind you.)

If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking, don't look back. (don't look back)
Forget about the past now
Don't look back, baby. (don't look back)
Keep on walking and don't look back. Hmm (don't look back)
(The past is behind you, let nothing remind you)

Love can be such a beautiful thing
Though your first love let you down
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
Oh yeah, yeah
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby
The second time around
Oh yeah
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on pushing and don't look back. (Don't look back)
Don't look back, girl. (Don't look back)
Oh no we won't look back. (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and won't look back. (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and won't look back. (Don't look back)



[Verse 1]
They came at night leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
"I'm never coming back"
They heard him cry
And I believe him
Well, he never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long

[Chorus]
Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere
That I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere
That I can find you, oh no

[Verse 2]
Searching through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop til' they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand
They never asked him why
"Get out of my way"
They heard him shout
Then a blinding light
Ooh, all I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night

[Chorus]
Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere
That I can find you, oh no
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number

Don't give up
Keep running, keep hiding
Don't give up

Don't give up
You know that I am on your side
Don't give up
Oh Billy, you better, you better, you better run for your life

Ooh all I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Don't give up
Keep running, keep hiding
Don't give up
Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up
You know that I am on your side
Don't give up
Oh Billy, you better, you better, you better run for your life
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
He never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long
Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Now Billy, oh
Now Billy



Pon tu fe en lo que tu más creas
Un ser, dos mundos son
Te guiará, tu corazón decidirá por ti

Un paraíso sin tocar, en este mundo de amor
Se vive bien, se vive en paz

Suaves huellas dejas en la arena
Un ser, dos mundos son
Te guiará, tu corazón decidirá por ti

La jungla cubre a tu ser
Sólo amor podría entrar
Se vive bien, se vive en paz

Concreta, saca el valor, da fuerza a quien necesita
Construye hoy tu protección, las cosas hoy cambian
Peligro vas a encontrar

El llanto no podrá curar la herida de tu corazón
No todo está perdido aún

Oye alguien que te está llamando
Un ser, dos mundos son
Te guiará, tu corazón decidirá por ti



Pon tu fe en lo que tu más creas
Un ser, dos mundos son
Te guiará, tu corazón decidirá por ti

Un paraíso sin tocar, en este mundo de amor
Se vive bien, se vive en paz

Suaves huellas dejas en la arena
Un ser, dos mundos son
Te guiará, tu corazón decidirá por ti

La jungla cubre a tu ser
Sólo amor podría entrar
Se vive bien, se vive en paz

Concreta, saca el valor, da fuerza a quien necesita
Construye hoy tu protección, las cosas hoy cambian
Peligro vas a encontrar

El llanto no podrá curar la herida de tu corazón
No todo está perdido aún

Oye alguien que te está llamando
Un ser, dos mundos son
Te guiará, tu corazón decidirá por ti



Esa union
Se ace mas intensa
Un ser
Dos mundos son
Te guiara tu corazon
Y dedcidira por ti



[Paul Young]
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

[Boy George]
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[George Michael]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard

[Simon LeBon (Duran Duran)]
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

[Sting]
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

[Bono & Sting]
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono]
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

[Boy George & Others]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

[Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Here's to you

[Paul Young]
Raise a glass for everyone

[Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Here's to them

[Paul Young, Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

[Chorus: All]
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again



[Verse 1]
It's good to be here! How've you been?
Check my bags, boy! Where's my room?
Gotta sit on the phone, that's my game
Keep up the pressure all the way!

[Chorus 1]
I don't want to beat about the bush
But none of us are getting any younger
There's people out there who could take your place
A more commercial view, fresher face

[Verse 2]
I need a shower, take a nap
I'll meet you in the bar, we must have a rap
There's a lot on the line, a lot to say
And there's something I must tell you today

[Chorus 2]
You and I both knew the score
You can't go on like this forever
So it's with regret that I tell you now
That from this moment on
You're on your own!

[Refrain]
I don't talk round corners, right between the eyes
If you're slow they'll run past you
Stand tall, see them falling over
I walk a straight line, right between the eyes
But show me the door, show me someone who'll do it better

[Verse 3]
The drinks are on me, be my guest
Smoke a cigar? Take the best
Don't hedge your bets, we can make a deal
Got it in your pocket, how do you feel?

[Chorus 3]
So glad that's over, now you know
But I'm only acting under orders
And looking down on you from way up here
You've gotta sink or swim, get off the floor!

[Refrain]
I don't talk round corners, it's right between the eyes
If you're slow they'll run past you
Stand tall, see them falling over
I walk a straight line, right between the eyes
But show me the door, show me someone who'll do it better



[Verse 1]
You said you would, you didn't and I wanna know why
And don't make no excuses
You promised, you promised, you better explain
Tho' I don't know what the use is
You said you could, you couldn't, now why did you lie
You made it look so easy
You did it, why do it, what was your point?
Laughing while you tease me

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know and do you care?

[Verse 2]
I said I did, I shouldn't because the magic will go
It happened once before
You'll see it, you'll steal it and take it away
And then come back for more
Don't say you weren't, you were because I saw you myself
It's too late for your reason
You're lying, you're lying, you've done it this time
I'm sick of all the cheating

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know and do you care?

[Verse 3]
Because I watch you
Ooh every day I watch you pass me by
I'll get you
Yes in the end I'll get you
Just watch me try

Oh you make it hard to be hard but I'm trying my best
Because down inside I'm burning
You want it, you get it, now take it and run
I'll hide how much it's hurting

Oh, do you know and do you care?
Oh, do you know and do you care?
Oh, do you know and do you care?



[Verse 1]
We never talked about it
But I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time

'Cause I love you, but I can't take any more
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try, like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies? (Telling me lies)

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 2]
There seemed no way to make up
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 3]
Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
'Cause they just can't wait
To get hurt again

[Chorus]
Tell me, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 4]
There are things we won't recall
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
'Cause we never seemed to have the time

There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But "I love you" wasn't one of those things
And now it's too late

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Uh, yeah
Tell me, do you rememeber?... (Do you remember? Now it's over)
Do you remember? (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Tell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Now it's over)
Tell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Do you remember?...



Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby can't you see
I wanna be famous a star of the screen
But you can do something in between

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep mm beep beep yeah

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

I told that girl I could start right away
And she said listen baby I got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep mm beep beep yeah
Beep beep mm beep beep yeah
Beep beep mm beep beep yeah



[Intro]
No matter where you go I'll be there
No matter where you hide I'll find you
I'll be there looking through the window watching everything you do
There's no escaping me
I'll be like your worst enemy
I'm right behind you every place you run to I'll be there with you

[Verse 1]
Because being without you is driving me crazy
Oh I just don't know what to do
Yes being without you is driving me crazy
Because all I want is you
And I like it
If all the world's a stage and we are
We're only just two crazy players
Please understand why I just can't go on without you anymore
There's no escaping me
I want you back, can't you see
I'm losing all control and cannot guarantee my sanity

[Chorus]
Because being without you is driving me crazy
And I don't know what to do
Yes being without you is driving me crazy
Because all I want is you
Being without you is driving me crazy
I don't know how long I'll last
Being without you is driving me crazy
Feel my pulse it's going so fast

[Bridge]
You, you're driving me crazy
Me, I'm out of my mind
You, you're making me crazy
Me, I'm running out of time

[Verse 2]
I am your conscience, I'm your guide
I know just what you feel inside
I share your darkest thoughts with you but share no consequences for them
There's no escaping me
I'm with you while you sleep
I hear your lies, I hear your truth
I hear you speak before you do

[Chorus][x2]



Leaving my family behind me
Not knowing what lay ahead
Waving goodbye, as I left them in tears
Remembering all we'd said

I looked to the sky, I offered my prayers
I asked Him for guidance and strength
But the simple beliefs of a simple man
Lay in His hands, and on my head (my head)

I gave everything that they wanted
But still they wanted more
We sweat and we toiled
Good men lost their lives
I don't think they knew what for

I sold them my heart
I sold them my soul
I gave everything I had
Ah, but they couldn't break my spirit
My dignity fought back
(fight back)
(just fight back)

Ah, can you hear me?
Can you see?
Don't you hear me?
Don't you see?

We worked in gangs for all we were worth
The young boys pulling the wagons
We were digging the tunnel, shifting the earth
It was then that it happened

No one knew how the cracks appeared
But as it fell they all disappeared
Stone fell like rain

Ah, can an you hear me?
Can you see?
Don't you hear me?
(Can) Can you breathe?

The smoke cleared, the dust it settled
No one knew how many had died
All around there were broken men
They'd said it was safe, they'd lied
You could hear the cries, you could smell our fear
But good fortune that day was mine
And it occurred to me that the heart of a good man-
It seems is hard to find

Ah, can you hear me?
Can you see?
(Don't) Don't you hear me?
(Don't) Don't you see?

We worked, how we worked like
The devil for our pay
Through the wind, through the snow
And through the rain

Blasting, cutting through God's country like a knife
With sweat stinging my eyes, there has to be a better life

But I can hear my childrens' cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Memories of those I've left behind
Still ringing in my ears
Will I ever go back again?
Will I ever see her face again?
Cause I'll always remember the night-
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We came from the North
We came from the South
With picks and with spades
And a new kind of order
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead
They'll never see the likes of us again

Driving the last spike
Lifting and laying the track
With blistering hands
The sun burning your back

But I can hear my childrens' cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Oh the memories of those I've lft behind
They're still ringing in my ears
Well I'll always remember that night
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We followed the rail, we slept under the stars
Digging in darkness, and living with danger
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead
They'll never see the likes of us again

Ah, can you hear me?
Can you see?
(Don't) Don't you hear me?
(Don't) Don't you see?

Times were good
She never thought about the future, she just did what she would
But she really cared
About her music, it all seemed so important then

And she dreamed that every time she performed
Everyone would cry for more
That all she had to do was step into the light
And everyone would start to roar

And on the road
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge
She battled through
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds

But now everytime that she performed
Everybody cried for more
Soon all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for

But time went by
It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong
Yes times were hard
Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want

An then there was the time that she performed
When nobody called for more
And soon everytime she stepped into the light
They really let her know the score
But she dreamed of the times when she sang her songs
And everybody cried for more
When all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for



Times were good
Well she never thought about the future, she just did what she would
Aw but she really cared, about her music
It all seemed so important then

She dreamed of time she performed
When everyone would cry for more
Then all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar

And on the road
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge
She battled through
Aw, against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds

Now everytime that she performed
When everyone would cried for more
Soon all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar

And all the children cried, you're the one we’ve waited for
Oh...

The time went by
Things weren't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong
Yes times were hard
It was too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want

And then there was a time when she performed
When nobody called for more
Soon every single time she stepped into the light
They really let her know the score
But she dreamed of the time when she sang her songs
And everyone would cry for more
When all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar

And all the children cried, you’re the one we've waited for
Oh...

[Most are quoted from "Guide Vocal"]
I am the one who guided you this far
All you know and all you feel
Nobody must know my name
For nobody would understand
And you kill what you fear
And you fear what you don't understand

I call you, for I must leave
You're on your own until the end
There was a choice, but now it's gone
I said you wouldn't understand
Take what's yours and be damned

She's an easy lover (she's a easy lover)
She'll get a hold on you believe it (get a hold on you)
(She's) like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees (you'll be down on your knees)
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it (you won't feel it)
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see (trying to make you see)
She's an easy lover (she's a easy lover)
She'll get a hold on you believe it (get a hold on you)
(She's) like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees (you'll be down on your knees)
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it (you won't feel it)
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see (trying to make you see)



[Verse 1]
Ich find ueberall Einlass
Ich knacke Fenster und Tuer
Ich find schnell meine Wege
Der Kater schleicht ueber den Flur
Ich find all deine Sachen
Versteckt im Schrank und der Uhr

[Chorus 1]
Besser, besser, besser, besser, besser, besser
Besser mit dem Messer die Leitung verlegen
Wir sind unter uns
Ich lass mich erregen, erregen, erregen

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Ich fuehl diese Hochspannung
Wenn ich weiss, du weisst, ich bin da
Ich fuehl die Angst und den Atem
Der stockt und dann fragt, was da war
Ich fuehl die kalte Seide
Geruch in Kleidern ganz sonderbar

[Chorus 2]
Eindringling, gluecklich nachts nur
Eindringling kommt
Eindringling kommt und legt, legt seine Spur
Seine Spur, seine Spur

[Outro]
Eindringling
Eindringling, Eindringling
Eindringling, Eindringling
Eindringling



[Christian]
Love is a many splendored thing
Love lifts us up where we belong
All you need is love!

[Satine]
Please, don't start that again

[Christian]
All you need is love

[Satine]
A girl has got to eat

[Christian]
All you need is love

[Satine]
Or she'll end up on the streets

[Christian]
All you need is love

[Satine]
Love is just a game

[Christian]
I was made for loving you baby, you were made for loving me

[Satine]
The only way of loving me baby, is to pay a lovely fee

[Christian]
Just one night, give me just one night

[Satine]
There's no way, 'cause you can't pay

[Christian]
In the name of love, one night in the name of love

[Satine]
You crazy fool, I won't give in to you

[Christian]
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive without your sweet love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way

[Satine]
You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs

[Christian]
I look around me and I see, it isn't so, oh no

[Satine]
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs

[Christian]
Well what's wrong with that? I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again!
Love lifts us up where we belong
Where eagles fly, on a mountain high

[Satine]
Love makes us act like we are fools
Throw our lives away, for one happy day

[Christian]
We could be heroes! Just for one day

[Satine]
You, you will be mean

[Christian]
No I won't!

[Satine]
And I, I'll drink all the time

[Christian]
We should be lovers

[Satine]
We can't do that

[Christian]
We should be lovers, and that's a fact

[Satine]
Though nothing, will keep us together

[Christian]
We could steal time...

[Both]
Just for one day
We could be heroes, forever and ever
We could be heroes, forever and ever
We could be heroes...

[Christian]
Just because I will always love you
[Satine]
I

[Both]
Can't help loving you

[Satine]
How wonderful life is

[Both]
Now you're in the world



Dites à mes amis que je m'en vais
Je pars vers de nouveaux pays
Où le ciel est tout bleu, dites que je m'en vais
Et c'est tout ce qui compte dans ma vie

Dites à mes amis que je m'en vais
Et j'aime chacun des pas que je fais
Le soleil est mon guide et moi je m'en vais
Je ne peux m'empêcher de sourire

Car il n'y a rien de mieux que de se revoir
Peu importe ce qui nous sépare
Vous ne pouvez que sourire de nos histoires
Oh ça me fait chaud au cœur

Alors dites leurs que je m'en vais
Je pars vers de nouveaux amis
Et dormir sous les étoiles c'est mon idéal
Sous la lune qui protège mes nuits

Ni la neige ni la pluie changeront ma vie
Le soleil se lèvera c'est écrit
Le vent qui frotte mon visage réchauffe mon cœur
Je pars vers un avenir meilleur

C'est vrai, je m'en vais
Et je souris
C'est vrai je m'en vais
(C'est vrai je m'en vais x3)

Dites à mes amis que je m'en vais
Je suis impatient d'arriver
Et le ciel toujours bleu
Dites que je m'en vais
J'ai du bon temps à partager

Dites à mes amis que je m'en vais
Je suis impatient de rentrer
Sous le soleil qui descend
Oui je m'en vais
Vers le bonheur à partager
Oui je m'en vais

Dites que je m'en vais



[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
Tout le pouvoir d'être fort
Et la sagesse d'être sage
Un jour tu auras tout ça en toi
Tu trouveras dans ton long voyage
Les réponses que tu cherchais
Car si tu gravis la montagne
Tu atteins son sommet

[Chorus]
Enfant de l'homme, regarde au ciel
En élevant ton esprit
Tu atteindras l'arc-en-ciel
Enfant de l'homme, tu deviendras un homme

[Verse 2]
Personne pour guider ton chemin
Ni pour prendre ta main
Mais si la foi en toi raisonne
D'un enfant tu feras un homme

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Découvrir en donnant
Et donner en découvrant
Tu trouveras ta place au coeur des tiens
Toutes les visions, les idées
Les rêves que tu as fais
Les plus secrets de tes désirs
Vont bientôt t'appartenir

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Enfant de l'homme
Enfant de l'homme, pour tous, tu seras un homme



Que sepa el mundo que en marcha estoy
Con mucho que ver y vivir
Los cielos azules andando voy
A un lugar asi soaba con ir
Que sepa el mundo que en marcha estoy
Que me gusta cada instante aqui
Con el sol mas brillante mis pasos doy
No hacia falta la risa en mi
Y es lo mas importante volvernos a ver
No me importa donde tenga que ir
Mil historias hay que oir y van a ser las que quiero compartir
Tu diles que me siento bien con tanto que ver y vivir
Con la luna sobre mi duermo en un eden
Nada mas se podria pedir
Ni la lluvia caer me va a cambiar
El sol siempre vuelve salir
Y sentir el viento sobre tu piel te va a encantar
Sigo mi camino, mi destino, es mi camino...
Whistlering.....
Que sepa el mundo en marcha estoy
Y voy a cumplir mi mision (voy a cumplir mi mision)
Los cielos azules por donde voy dan alas a mi corazon
Y que sepan todos que en marcha estoy
Que voy a volver a mojar
Con el sol mas brillante mi pasos doy
Disfruto el camino al andar
(En marcha estoy... si en marcha estoy)



Como me apena
El verte llorar
Toma mi mano
Siéntela
Yo te protejo
De cualquier cosa
No llores más
Aquí estoy

Frágil te ves
Dulce sensual
Quiero abrazarte
Te protegeré
Esta fusión
Es irrompible
No llores más
Aquí estoy

En mi corazón
Tú vivirás
Desde hoy será
Y para siempre amor
En mi corazón
No importa qué dirán
Dentro de mí
Estarás siempre

No pueden entender
Nuestro sentir
Ni confiarán
En nuestro proceder
Sé que hay diferencias
Mas por dentro
Somos iguales
Tú y yo

En mi corazón
Tú vivirás
Desde hoy será
Y para siempre amor

No escuches ya más
Que pueden saber
Si nos queremos
Mañana y hoy
Entenderán
Lo sé

Tal vez el destino
Te hará pensar
Mas la soledad
Tendrás que aguantar
Entenderán
Lo sé
Lo haremos muy juntos

Pues, en mi corazón créeme
Que tú vivirás
Estarás dentro de mí hoy
Y por siempre amor

Tú en mi corazón
(Sí, en mi corazón)
No importa qué dirán
(No sufras más)
Dentro de mí estarás
(Estarás)
Siempre
Siempre
Aquí siempre
Para ti estaré siempre
Siempre
Y por siempre
Solo mira a tu lado
Solo mira a tu lado
Solo mira a tu lado
Yo estaré siempre



[Chorus]
Crois en ce qui compte le plus pour toi
Deux mondes, une seule famille
Laisse ton coeur, et le Destin guider toutes ces vies !

[Verse 1]
Un paradis vierge des hommes
Dans un monde fait d'Amour
Leur vie est simple, ils vivent en paix

[Chorus]
Marche sur le chemin de sable fin
Deux mondes, une seule famille
Laisse ton cœur
Et le destin guider toutes ces vies

[Verse 2]
Cachés au cœur de la forêt
Où seul l'amour peut entrer
Leur vie est simple
Ils vivent en paix

[Verse 3]
Lève la tête
Porte ton fardeau
Puise ta force en ceux qui t'aiment
Construis des murs
Solides et hauts
Une nouvelle vie t'attend
Où le danger vient rôder

Les mots ne sèchent pas les pleurs
Les mots ne réparent pas les cœurs
Le rêve s'endort
Mais pas l'espoir

[Chorus]
Là-bas, entends la voix qui t'appelle
Deux mondes, une seule famille
Laisse ton cœur
Et le destin guider toutes ces vies !



Crois en ce qui compte le plus pour toi
Deux mondes, une seule famille
Laisse ton coeur
Et le destin
Guider ces vies
Guider toutes ces vies
Crois en ce qui compte le plus pour toi
Deux mondes, une seule famille



C'est la force de ce lien qui nous lie
Deux mondes, une seule famille
Laisse ton cœur
Et le destin
Guider toutes ces vies



Quando a terra e o ar
Sem nenhum pudor
Se deitavam sob o sol
Semeavam luz
Na imensidão
Com o brilho de um farol

Três irmãos ali felizes viviam
Sempre unidos pelo amor
Ergueram a mão, fazendo uma prece
Para os céus, entoando um louvor

Espíritos, nossos ancestrais
Sejam nossos guias
Tragam sua luz e muito mais
Somos o seu povo
Todos são iguais
Nessa irmandade
A caminho da paz
Como irmãos e como iguais

E ensinem o bem verdadeiro
No amor dessa união
Nossas decisões, escolhas que são
O futuro em nossas mãos

Seremos gratos por tudo que temos
Todos nós, sempre juntos a sonhar
Cultivar nossa fé, pra no fim da jornada
Compreender que outra vai começar

Espíritos, nossos ancestrais
Sejam nossos guias
Tragam sua luz e muito mais
Somos o seu povo
Todos são iguais
Nessa irmandade
A caminho da paz
Como irmãos e como iguais

Espíritos, nossos ancestrais
Sejam nossos guias
Tragam sua luz e muito mais
Somos o seu povo
Todos são iguais
Nessa irmandade
A caminho da paz
Como irmãos e como iguais

Todos são iguais



[Verse 1]
I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I'll stay
So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you

[Chorus]
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Verse 2]
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still i love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by
And everyday i fall
It makes me wonder why
My life's worth nothing without you

[Chorus]
But everyday i say i'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Bridge]
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

[Verse 3]
The book closes and we try to forget
But i know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as i may
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

[Chorus]
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Outro]
Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

[Outro]
Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

[Outro]
Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard



Young Tarzan:

Will someone tell me where I belong?
Where I should go
Can someone tell me where I am going wrong?
I need to know

Tarzan:

Is this my past here before me
Is this my story unfolding?
It’s all here to discover
Everything that I am
Can this be what I’ve been seeking?
All my life I’ve been waiting for this
And now these memories
Will they make me see more?

Ooh I want to know where I belong
I want to know where I came from
I want to know the reason why I’m here
The way I am
Feeling the things I feel

Is this my family?
Can it really be them that I see?
My father and mother
And in their arms can it really be me
All these emotions
I can barely control
Cause the family I had
Is not the family I know?

Ooh and I got to know where I belong
I got to know where I came from
I got to know the reason why I’m here
The way I am
Feeling the things I feel

These spirits calling me
Familiar voices haunting
Disappearing taunting me
This is the choice I must make

Cause I know where I belong
I know where I, I came from
I know the reason why
I must decide
And leave here
The man I am inside

The future is clear for me to see
To be the man I’m meant to be
Like my father with my head up high
Standing tall
And proud of all
That I am

I’m a man!

Another time it might have been so different
If only we could do it all again
But now it's just another fading memory
Out of focus, though the outline still remains

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember

Like the story that we wish was never ending
We know sometime we must reach the final page
Still we carry on just pretending
That there'll always be another day to go

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives so remember

[Instrumental]

Another chance hello, another goodbye
And so many things we'll never see again
Days of life that seemed so unimportant
Seem to matter and to count much later on

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember



Another time it might have been so different
If only we could do it all again
But now it's just another fading memory
Out of focus, though the outline still remains

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember

Like the story that we wish was never ending
We know sometime we must reach the final page
Still we carry on just pretending
That there'll always be another day to go

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives so remember

[Instrumental]

Another chance hello, another goodbye
And so many things we'll never see again
Days of life that seemed so unimportant
Seem to matter and to count much later on

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember



[Verse 1]
The streets are lined with camera crews
Everywhere he goes is news
Today is different, today is not the same
Today I make the action, take snapshot into the light
Snapshot into the light, I'm shooting into the light

[Verse 2]
Four miles down the cavalcade moves on
Driving into the sun
If I worked it out right, they won't see me or the gun
Two miles to go, they're clearing the road
And the cheering has really begun
I've got my radio, I can hear what's going on

[Bridge 1]
I've been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this
All you people in TV land
I will wake up your empty shells
Peak-time viewing blown in a flash
As I burn into your memory cells
'Cause I'm alive

[Verse 3]
They're coming around the corner with the bikers at the front
I'm wiping the sweat from my eyes
It's a matter of time, a matter of will
And the governor's car is not far behind, he's not the one I've got in mind
'Cause there he is, the man of the hour, standing in the limousine

[Bridge 2]
I don't really hate you, I don't care what you do
We were made for each other, me and you
I want to be somebody, you were like that too
If you don't get given you learn to take
And I will take you
Holding my breath
Release the catch
And I let the bullet fly

[Outro]
All turned quiet, I have been here before
A lonely boy hiding behind the front door
Friends have all gone home
There's my toy gun on the floor
Come back, Mum and Dad
You're growing apart, you know that I'm growing up sad
I need some attention
I shoot into the light



Watcher of the skies watcher of all
His is a world alone no world is his own
He whom life can no longer surprise
Raising his eyes beholds a planet unknown

Creatures shaped this planet's soil
Now their reign has come to an end
Has life again destroyed life
Do they play elsewhere, do they know
More than their childhood games?
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth

Judge not this race by empty remains
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead?
For now, the lizard's shed its tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth

From life alone to life as one
Think not your journey's done
For though your ship be sturdy, no
Mercy has the sea
Will you survive on the ocean of being?
Come ancient children hear what I say
This is my parting counsel for you on your way

Sadly now your thoughts turn to the stars
Where we have gone you know you never can go
Watcher of the skies watcher of all
This is your fate alone, this fate is your own



Somewhere down the road, you're gonna find a place
It seems so far, but it never is
You won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength
On the way

Sometimes you may feel you're the only one
Cos all the things you thought were safe, now they're gone
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
Watching you 'til all your work is done

When you find your heart, you'd better run with it
Cos when she comes along, she could be breaking it
No there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong
Don't look back
She may soon be gone, no don't look back
She's not the only one, remember that

If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right
You don't know what to do?
Remember she is just as scared as you

Don't be shy, even when it hurts to say
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway
Then you must lift your head, keep it there
Remember what I said
I'll always be with you don't forget
Just look over your shoulder I'll be there

If you look behind you, I will be there



I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about
Fiddling about
Fiddle about
Down with the bedclothes
Up with the nightshirt
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about

Put your faith in what you most believe in
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart
Let fate decide
To guide these lives
Tu guide these lives we see

Put your faith in what you most believe in
Two worlds, one family

(Tarzan yells)



[Verse 1]
Find a way to my heart, and I will always be with you
From wherever you are, I'll be waiting
I'll keep a place in my heart, you will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow you

[Verse 2]
This journey's not easy for you, I know
If your footsteps get too faint to hear, I'll go
Cos you know, questions are never that easy
And never the same
You have the answer believe me
If you have the faith

[Chorus]
So find a way to my heart
And I will always be with you
From wherever you are
I'll be waiting
I will keep a place in my heart
You will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow you

[Verse 3]
Time may come, and time may go, I know
If you should call out for me, I'll go
But you know, there is a code to be broken
I wrap it around
Without a word being spoken
Without a sound
There's a reason I hide my heart
Out of sight out of mind
And when I find out just who you are
The door will be open for you to

[Chorus]
Find a way to my heart
And I will be always with you
From wherever you are
I'll be waiting
I will keep a place in my heart
You will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow you
Oh, find a way to my heart
And I will be always with you
From wherever you are
I'll be waiting
I will keep a place in my heart
You will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow you



[Verse 1]
The path is clear
Though no eyes can see
The course laid down long before
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Though many times they've seen the way to leave

[Verse 2]
He rides majestic
Past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy
To see reflected there
The trees, the sky, the lily fair
The scene of death is lying just below

[Bridge]
The mountain cuts off the town from view
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill
Let it be revealed

A waterfall, his madrigal
An inland sea, his symphony

[Verse 3]
Undinal songs
Urge the sailors on
'Til lured by the sirens' cry

[Instrumental interlude]

[Verse 4]
Now as the river dissolves in sea
So Neptune has claimed another soul
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Until the shepherd leads his flock away
The sands of time were eroded by
The river of constant change



[Verse 1]
There's something solid forming in the air
And the wall of death is lowered in Times Square
No one seems to care
They carry on as if nothing was there
The wind is blowing harder now
Blowing dust into my eyes
The dust settles on my skin
Making a crust I cannot move in
And I'm hovering like a fly, waiting for the windshield on the freeway

Echoes of The Broadway Everglades
With their mythical madonnas still walking in their shades:
Lenny Bruce declares a truce and plays his other hand
Marshall McLuhan, casual viewing, head buried in the sand
Sirens on the rooftops wailing, but there's no ships sailing
Groucho, with his movies trailing, stands alone with his punchline failing

Ku Klux Klan serve hot soul food and the band plays In the Mood
The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand
There's a smell of peach blossom and bitter almond
Caryl Chessman sniffs the air, and leads the parade
He knows, in a scent, you can bottle what you made

There's Howard Hughes in blue suede shoes
Smiling at the Majorette, smoking Winston cigarettes
And as the song and dance begins, the children play at home
With needles
Needles and pins



[Verse 1]
Stay with me
My love, I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side if ever I need you
Oh, my love

In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
And every day is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you

[Chorus 1]
I will follow you, will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be, I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year

[Verse 2]
With the dark
Oh, I see so very clearly now
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away

I can say
The night is long, but you are here
Close at hand, oh, I'm better for the smile you give
And while I live I will

[Chorus 2]
Follow you, will you
Follow me all the days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year there will be

[Synthesizer solo: Tony Banks]

[Chorus 3 with repeats]
I will follow you will you
Follow me All the
Days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year I will

Follow you, will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be, I will
Stay with you, will you
Stay with me, just one
Single tear in each
Passing year, I will

Follow you, will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be, I will
Stay with you, will you
Stay with me, just one
Single tear in each
Passing year...

[Synthesizer solo on fade-out]



Stay with me
My love, I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side, if ever I need you
Oh my love

In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
Every day is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you

I will follow you, will you follow me?
All the days and nights, that we know we’ll be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year

With the dark
Oh, I see so very clearly now
But all my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Aw, fading away

But I can say
The night is long, oh but you are here
Close at hand, oh, I'm better for the smile you give to me
And while I live I will

Follow you, will you follow me?
All the days and nights, that we know we'll be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year there will be

[Keyboard Solo (Tony Banks)]

I will follow you, will you follow me?
All the days and nights, that we know we’ll be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year

I will follow you, will you follow me?
All of the days and nights, that we know we'll be
I will stay with you, will you please stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year

I will follow you, will you follow me?
All of the days and nights, that we know we'll be
I will stay with you, will you please stay with me?
Just one single tear, in each passing year
I will...



[Verse 1]
Sunday at six when they close both the gates
A widowed pair, still sitting there
Wonder if they're late for church
And it's cold, so they fasten their coats
And cross the grass, they're always last

[Chorus 1]
Passing by the padlocked swings
The roundabout still turning
Ahead they see a small girl
On her way home with a pram

[Verse 2]
Inside the archway
The priest greets them with a courteous nod
He's close to God
Looking back at days of four instead of two
Years seem so few (four instead of two)
Heads bent in prayer
For friends not there

[Chorus 2]
Leaving twopence on the plate
They hurry down the path and through the gate
And wait to board the bus
That ambles down the street



[Verse 1]
When i saw him last
He had that look in his eyes
I said, "do you need to talk?"
He said, "no."
So i called him up, asked him again and i waited a while
He began to speak, then he started to cry
You know some things are best left unspoken
And some things just never work out
And sometimes, seems you try and you try and whatever you do
There's a fix that you're in, and you just can't get out

[Chorus]
He said, "i need your help, i need it now
Give me the strength to go on"

[Verse 2]
Though i didn't know what
I knew that something was wrong
But he still had his pride
He'd tell me in time
Well this feeling inside
Kept eating at me
I was losing a friend, and i had to know why
When i heard the voice on the phone, i knew it was bad news
So i rushed to be by his side
And we said goodbye for the last time
I gently hugged him, and kissed him goodbye

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We were always laughing
I just remember laughing, mama
We were always laughing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Though as time goes by, and it all becomes clear
We can see the deceit, we see the lies
So i asked myself, over and over, and over again
What did they know? What did they hide?
Fools, leading the innocent blindly
Fools, turning away
And i know that
When i think of my friend with that look in his eyes
And if they told the truth, he might be here today

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I remember the laughing
We were always laughing
Oh no - it's just strength we need now
Just the strength to go on...
We need the strength to go on



I know, baby, yes, I know
Yes, I know that he hurt you
I can see it in your eyes
You pretend it doesn't matter
But you feel it all so deep inside

You know you've been running from love
You keep saying you've had enough

For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
So, baby, don't give up, oh no

'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
And I'm waiting to get you into my life

Love is the whisper
When all the talking is done
And you don't know you're in it
Until after it's begun

Somewhere deep in this night
We'll find each other and know it's right

For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
So baby don't give up, oh no

'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
And I'm waiting to get you in
Come on in, come on in

It only takes one to be lonely
So why don't the two of us take a chance

For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
Baby, baby, baby, don't you give up

'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
Just to get you into my life

For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
Just to get you into my life

'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
Don't give it up, girl, no, no, no

For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love



Jane
This affection I feel is hard to understand
It?s not the way I planned
My world is changing
Wherever I turn
It?s his face I see
Looking back at me
And in my eyes I can't disguise
The affection I feel
Is getting the better off me

Oh for the first time it's not a dream
Oh for the first time it seems so real
That I want to remember
Every moment
That I'm there beside him
When he gently takes my hand
So here I am
Feeling things I've never felt
And all because of him
My world is changing

Tarzan
She?s turned my whole world upside down

Jane
Everything that I do
I do to catch his eye
Well and I won't deny
I stand here guilty

Tarzan
I wonder if she feels the same

BothIs this affection (as) I feel
Has gotten the better of me

So for the first time
Can this be love?
Oh for the first time
I know it's real

Jane
And with him I feel

Both
So completely
Uniquely like no other
As he gently holds me close

Jane
But wait a minute
What am I saying?

Tarzan
Ne?er thought no

Jane
I never thought
On a scale so grand

Tarzan
To be feeling

Jane
Are these emotions
Racing through me
Tell me I must
Tell me I can

Tarzan
I never felt these things

Both
I?m finding who I am
Cause for the first time

Jane
I have no doubt

Tarzan
These things she does

Both
But for the first time
I understand, try to understand
Yes for the first time
I realise
That all the things they strange/separate happened
Well they?re happening to me

Jane
Every time I'm with that man

Tarzan
Every time I'm with her

Jane
Every time I'm with

Tarzan
Could I be

Both
That man



From a dense forest of tall, dark, pinewood
Mount Ida rises, like an island
Within a hidden cave, nymphs had kept a child:
Hermaphroditus, son of gods, afraid of their love, ooh...

As the dawn creeps up the sky
The hunter caught sight of a doe
In desire for conquest
He found himself within a glade, he'd not beheld before

"Where are you my father!
Give wisdom to your son!"

And as his strength began to fail
He saw a shimmering lake
A shadow in the dark green depths
Disturbed the strange tranquility

"The waters are disturbed!
Some creature has been stirred!"

As he rushed to quench his thirst
A fountain spring appeared before him
And as his heated breath, brushed through the cool mist
A liquid voice called, "Son of god, drink from my spring"

The water tasted strangely sweet
Behind him the voice called again
He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone
And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake

"We shall be one!
We shall be joined as one!"

[Instrumental]

"Away from me cold-blooded woman!
Your thirst is not mine!"

"Nothing will cause us to part!
Hear me O' Gods!"

Unearthly calm, descended from the sky, oh...

And then their flesh and bones, were strangely merged
Forever to be joined as one

[Instrumental]

The creature crawled into the lake
A fading voice, was heard:

"And I beg, that all who touch this spring!
May share my fate!"

"We are the one!
We are the one!"

Both had given everything they had, oh, oh...
A lover's dream had been fulfilled at last
Forever lost, beneath the lake



[Strophe 2]
Was immer du tust, ich tu's wie du
Zeig mir alles und erkär mir wie
Es sagt mir gar nichts und sagt mir doch so viel
Ja ich will lernen, ich fang gleich an
Es ist alles so nah und doch so fern
Ich seh mich schon mit ihren Augen
Ich weiß das draussen etwas auf mich wartet

[Refrain]
Ich will es so, will was neues
Ich will sie kennen die so fremd sind wie ich
Sag mir wo, woher kommt es?
Denn ich erkenne sie, die so fremd sind wie ich

[Strophe 2]
Wie sie lächelt
Und wie sie sich bewegt
Das bewegt mich wie nie zuvor
Was ist geschehen?
Ich sehn' mich so nach ihrer Nähe
Solche Gefühle sind mir so neu
Und kommen aus einer ganz and'ren Welt
Ein fernes Land und viele Freunde
Ich seh schon vor mir das Abenteuer

[Refrain]

[Outro]
Folge mir nun in meine Welt
Voller Schönheit und Harmonie
Kannst du fühlen was ich fühl
Nur du und ich
Hand in Hand, woher kommst du
Sag, von wo?



[Vers 1]
Du viser mig vej - jeg gør som dig
Vis mig alting og fortæl hvordan
Det gi'r ingen mening, men fortæl mig hvorfor

[Bro 1]
Der' så meget, jeg ska' lære nu
Så nært og dog så langt herfra
Jeg ser mig selv som andre ser mig
Og pludselig ved jeg, verden nok er større

[Omkvæd]
Jeg må ha' svar, så fortæl mig
Fortæl mig alt om disse fremmed' som mig
Vis mig mer' - fortæl mig
Der' noget bekendt ved disse fremmed' som mig

[Vers 2]
Hver bevægelse - hvert et skridt, som hun ta'r
Bringer nye følelser frem
Sig mig hvorfor, jeg kun vil vær' ved hendes side

[Bro 2]
Og sådan her har jeg aldrig følt
En længsel mod lande så langt herfra
Ude bag træerne over skyen
Jeg sy's, jeg ser dem i horisonten

[Omkvæd]
Jeg må ha' svar, så fortæl mig
Fortæl mig alt om disse fremmed' som mig
Vis mig mer' - fortæl mig
Der' noget bekendt ved disse fremmed' som mig

[Kontraststykke]
Kom med mig nu og se mit hjem
Det er smukt som et drømmesyn
Mon du føler ligesom jeg
— gør nu med dig?
Ta' min hånd - der' en verden, jeg må se

[Omkvæd]
Jeg må ha' svar, så fortæl mig
Fortæl mig alt om disse fremmed' som mig
Vis mig mer' - fortæl mig
Der' noget bekendt ved disse fremmed' som mig

[Outro]
Jeg må ha' svar



[Instrumental intro]

[John Pebble of Styx Enterprises]
"Get 'em out by Friday!
You don't get paid till the last one's well on his way
Get 'em out by Friday!
It's important that we keep to schedule, there must be no delay."

[Mark Hall of Styx Enterprises (otherwise known as "The Winkler")]
"I represent a firm of gentlemen who recently purchased this house and all the others in the road
In the interest of humanity we've found a better place for you to go-go-go."

[Mrs. Barrow (a tenant)]
"Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, they're asking us to leave."

[Mr. Pebble]
"Get 'em out by Friday!
I've told you before, 's good money gone if we let them stay
And if it isn't easy
You can squeeze a little grease and our troubles will soon run away."

[Mrs. Barrow]
"After all this time, they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent
I don't know why it seemed so funny
Seeing as how they'd take more money

The winkler called again, he came here this morning
With four hundred pounds and a photograph of the place he has found
A block of flats with central heating
I think we're going to find it hard."

[Mr. Pebble]
"Now we've got them!
I've always said that cash cash cash can do anything well
Work can be rewarding
When a flash of intuition is a gift that helps you excel-sell-sell-sell."

[Mr. Hall]
"Here we are in Harlow New Town, did you recognise your block
Across the square, over there
Sadly since last time we spoke, we've found we've had to raise the rent again
Just a bit."

[Mrs. Barrow]
"Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, and we agreed to leave."

[A passage of time]

[9 September 2012 T.V. Flash on all Dial-A-Program Services]
This is an announcement from Genetic Control:
"It is my sad duty to inform you of a four foot restriction on
Humanoid height."

[Extract from coversation of Joe Ordinary in Local Puborama]
"I hear the directors of Genetic Control have been buying all the
Properties that have recently been sold, taking risks oh so bold
It's said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
(they say it's alright)
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity, they've been told they must go
Told they must go-go-go-go."

[Sir John De Pebble of United Blacksprings International]
"I think I've fixed a new deal
A dozen properties - we'll buy at five and sell at thirty four
Some are still inhabited
It's time to send the winkler to see them
He'll have to work some more."

[Memo from Satin Peter of Rock Development Ltd.]
"With land in your hand, you'll be happy on earth
Then invest in the Church for your heaven."



[Verse 1]
I love you, girl, with all my heart and soul
I can't understand why you treat me cold
Your every wish, girl, is my command
And that's why I can't seem to understand why

[Chorus]
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm asking you girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?

[Verse 2]
One day you say you love me too
The next day you tell me that we are through
My love for you is just a game
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain

[Chorus]
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
I'm asking you girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
So blue...

[Verse 3]
Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue?
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, tell me why can't you be true?
The way you treat me, it just isn't fair
You make it so plain you just don't care
You have a ball around my time
Of sleepless nights I'm getting tired

[Outro]
Girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
I'm asking you girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue, Come on tell me
Girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
Oh oh girl, girl, girl, why you want to make me blue?
Come on tell me
Girl, girl,girl why you want to make me blue?



[Chorus: Phil Collins sample]
While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
While I sit here trying to think of things to say
Someone lies bleeding in a field somewhere

[Verse 1: Tom Gist]
Tom, Gist, yeah
See I seen too many dark days
So ya boy need change like an arcade
Mom prayed but, that ain't get the cans open
I was hungry, she was there with her hands folded
Can't focus, thinking of a better day
And drug dealers, they never ask for resumes
My father said, "Son, you need to educate" (educate)
And Rob said, music was a better way
I've been lead astray, you tell me
How to fix, when I stay on that shit like LT
I should just sell E, I can get a fair price
Fucked up, word to life, I can't even spare advice
Nah, I ain't got it, if I did I couldn't give it
I could leave life and not even miss it
I can't kick it or chill, fitting the bill
I'm ducking the charges
Without a canvas or a paintbrush, it's hard for an artist
I gave faith up, I'm trying to get this cake up
I'm authentic, y'all can keep the make up
Just gimme a shot, I got a beginning, I'm writing the plot
My life is a movie, I can't even watch
I'm right back to the block
Back to the struggle, this shit don't stop
You niggas ask me when my shit gon' drop, like they gon' cop
Not even, shit, it gets no clearer
Fight with shame, it's hard for me to look in the mirror
It's my pain, man

[Chorus: Phil Collins sample]
While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
While I sit here trying to think of things to say
But I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2: Penz]



I thought I'd never see the day
When you'd up and walk way
Now you're leaving
There is no doubt
Life is full of passion
Caviar and fashion
Go, go out and play
Hopes and dreams are in the past
We can't ever bring them back
What was once will never be
Time's run out for you and me

You'll find lots of takers
Instant moviemakers, waiting for you

Go, gor whatever reason
Go, it's the time and season
You have to do whatever's right
Oh oh go, for the fame and fortune
Go, if it's that important
You have to find it your own way

You'll find lots of takers
Instant moviemakers, waiting for you



[Verse]
I think I'm going back
To the thing I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
All those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains no more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
I can recall the time when
I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got a lot more than
Just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
And everyday can be my magic paradise
I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
Let everyone debate the true reality
I'd rather see my world the way it used to be
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can cause I'm going back

[Outro]
I'm going back
Not just sitting, walking away
Yes, I'm going back
Going back to my youth
Come on, catch me because I'm going back
I'm going back



[Verse 1]
Going to a go go[X2]
Na na na na, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, there's a brand new place I've found
Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere
And if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town

[Chorus[Chorus]
Going to a go go, everybody's
Going to a go go, well, come on now
Don't you want to go, yeah

[Bridge]
One more time, yeah I'm
Going to a go go, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going to a go go, baby come on now

[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter where you are
A go go can be far
You'll see the people from your block
And don't be shocked
If you see your favorite star

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Na na na na yeah, ooh tell me
Don't you want to go, yeah
Now it's alright, I-yi
Going to a go go, yes I am now
Going to a go go, oh come on now

[Verse 3]
It doesn't matter if you don't stagger
It doesn't matter if you don't drag
You should have some fun
I'm telling everyone
Most every taxi that you flag is

[Chorus]
Going to a go go, oh come on baby
Going to a go go, baby come on now
Don't you want to go, yeah
One more time, yeah

[Outro]
I'm going to a go go
Going to a go go, baby come on now
Going to a go go, oh come on baby
Going to a go go, oh come on now
Going to a go go



[Chanting]

[Verse 1]
When the Earth was young
And the air was sweet
And the mountains kissed the sky
In the far beyond, with its many paths
Man and nature lived side by side

The great wisdom does not come without learning
And great vision not wholly with our eyes
We can think that we see
Truly see all around us
But when we look
Do we see with open minds?

[Chorus]
Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
The key to understanding
Is to see through other's eyes
Find a way to help us
See from all sides
Truly see from all sides

[Verse 2]
Teach our children to look deeper than the surface
See the world through another's eyes
For to be blind beyond yourself
Is to look but not see it
Knowing much is not enough to be wise

To see the wonder
In all we've been given
In a world that's not always as it seems
On the path that we choose
Turn every corner
Follow on for another begins

[Chorus]
Great Spirits of all who lived before
(Take our hands)
Take our hands and lead us
(Fill our hearts)
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
(You know the key)
The key to understanding
Is to see through other's eyes
Find a way to help us
See from all sides
Truly see from all sides

[Chanting]

[Chorus]
Great Spirits of all who lived before
(Take our hands)
Take our hands and lead us
(Fill our hearts)
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
(You know the key)
The key to understanding
Is to see through other's eyes
Find a way to help us
See from all sides
Truly see from all sides

See from all sides!



[Verse 1]
When the Earth was young
And the air was sweet
And the mountains kissed the sky
In the great beyond with its many paths
Man and nature lived side by side

In this wilderness of danger and beauty
Lived three brothers bonded by love
Their hearts full of joy
They ask now for guidance
Reaching out to the skies up above

[Chorus]
Great spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same

[Verse 2]
Give us wisdom to pass to each other
And give us strength so we understand
That the things we do
The choices we make
Give direction to all life's plans
To look and wonder at all we've been given
In our world that's not always as it seems
Every corner we turn only leads to another
A journey ends but another begins

[Chorus]
Ooo, great spirits of all who lived before
(Take our hands)
Take our hands and lead us
(Fill our hearts)
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
(You know you can show)
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same

Ooo, great spirits of all who lived before
(Take our hands)
Take our hands and lead us
(Fill our hearts)
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
(You know you can show)
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same
Brothers all the same!

[Verse 1]
The signs are getting clearer
Clearer than you need
The writing's on the wall, for you to see

[Chorus 1]
You never thought you'd ever get the taste
You never thought that it could be this good
Just tell me what you want and I'll find the key
Reach out and touch it's all yours

[Chorus 2]
If you hang in long enough, you'll do it
Just hang in long enough

[Verse 2]
You're down on the ground, or so you say
You'd sell the hole in your pocket, if you could find a way
Don't ask me how I know, you don't wanna hear
It's been a long hard road, and the end is getting near

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
They always say
The best things in life are free
But you want to have everything
Well you're going to have to beg if you want it all

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
They'll let you out, then pull you in
Playing hell with your emotions
You'll feel like giving in

[Outro]
So just hang in long enough



Happy the man - he lives a simple life
He doesn't have much - it doesn't worry him
Where you go - where?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere

Like a nun with a gun - I'm wonderful fun
Laughing all through - just watching you
Seems a very stupid game...
But I don't care

Happy the man - he doesn't buzz around
Nothing he wants - any more than anything
Where you go - where?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere

Like a fool in the pool - I'm incredibly cool
With a grin on my chin - I'm certain to win
Someone says he's Jesus Christ - but I don't care

He is a good man
He is a good man
He is a good man
He is a good man
He is a good man
He is a good man

Happy the man - he doesn't buzz around
Nothing he wants - any more than anything
Where you go - where?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere



Came the night a mist dissolved the trees
And in the broken light colours fly, fading by
Pale and cold as figures fill the glade
Grey is the web they spin, on and on, and on and on
Through the flame still summer lingers on
Though her pictures soon shatter

All, always the same
But there appears in the shades of dawning
Though your eyes are dim
All of the pieces in the sky

There was once a harvest in this land
Reap from the turquoise sky, harlequin, harlequin
Dancing round, three children fill the glade
Theirs was the laughter in the winding stream, and in between
Close your door, the picture fades again
From the flames in the firelight

All, always the same
But there appears in the shades of dawning
Though your eyes are dim
All of the pieces in the sky

All, all is not lost
And light appears in the shades of dawning
When your eyes can see
Order the pieces, put them back, put them back



News:
A well-known Bognor restaurant-owner disappeared
Early this morning
Last seen in a mouse-brown overcoat
Suitably camouflaged
They saw him catch a train

Man-in-the-street:
"Father of three its disgusting"
"Such a horrible thing to do"
Harold the Barrel cut off his toes and he served them all for tea
"He can't go far", "He can't go far"
"Hasn't got a leg to stand on"
"He can't go far"

Man-on-the-spot:
I'm standing in a doorway on the main square
Tension is mounting
There's a restless crowd of angry people

Man-on-the-council:
"More than we've ever seen
- had to tighten up security"

Over to the scene at the town hall
The Lord Mayor's ready to speak

LORD MAYOR:
"Man of suspicion, you can't last long, the British Public is on our side"

BRITISH PUBLIC:
"You can't last long", "You can't last long"
"Said you couldn't trust him, his brother was just the same"
"You can't last long"

HAROLD:
If I was many miles from here
I'd be sailing in an open boat on the sea
Instead I'm on this window ledge
With the whole world below

Up at the window
Look at the window

Mr. Plod:
"We can help you"

Plod's Chorus:
"We can help you"

Mr. Plod:
"We're all your friends if you come on down and talk to us son"

HAROLD:
You must be joking
Take a running jump

The crowd was getting stronger and our Harold
Getting weaker;
Forwards, backwards, swaying side to side
Fearing the very worst
They called his mother to the site
Up on the ledge beside him
His mother made a last request

67-yr-old Mrs Barrel:
"Come off the ledge - if your father were alive he'd be very, very, very upset"
"Just can't jump, you just can't jump"
"Your shirt's all dirty and there's a man here from the B.B.C."
"You just can't jump"

Mr. Plod:
"We can help you"

Plod's Chorus:
"We can help you"

Mr. Plod:
"We're all your friends if you come on down and talk to us Harry"

HAROLD:
You must be joking
Take a running jump



In life there are those decisions
Which direction you should take
It's only later that you realize
All those simple mistakes you make
I don't like being alone
Don't wanna be by myself
But since you've gone that's all I can think oF
I can't think of nothing else

Oh, I said I'm sorry, soon I give it up
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up
Cos my heart's on fire
My heart's on fire

Woh can you take me there
Oh, come back and take me there
Cos I need to be with you
Be there with you

Yes there is no denying
Our love is not untrue
I know I've lied so many times before
But deep down there's only you
I need you here by my side
Together our love could grow
But first you have to believe that I want you
More than you'll ever know

Woh, I said I'm sorry and I give it up (give it up)
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)
Cos my heart's on fire
My heart's on fire

Woh can you take me there
Oh, come back and take me there
Cos I need to be with you
Be there with you

(give it up, give it up, give it up...)

With it we take our chances
What will be will be
But I don't care what the people may think
Just as long as you're here with me
Don't like being alone
Don't wanna be by myself
And since you've gone, well that's all I can think of
I can't think of nothing else

Woh, I said I'm sorry and I give it up (give it up)
You know I'm sorry soon I give it up (give it up)
You know I'm sorry soon I give it up
Cos my heart's on fire
My heart's on fire

Woh can you take me there
Oh, come back and take me there
Cos I need to be with you
Be there with you
You, be there with you

Hearts on fire
Hearts on fire
Hearts on fire
My heart's on fire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire...



[Verse 1]
You've got to shout if you've got something to say
I know it's getting bad, you read it every day
And you, you can try your best to fight it
But you can't make it on your own

[Chorus 1]
Someone better tell the people up there
I think they ought to know, the bubble's just about to bust
Tell them they'd better beware
The word is on the street, get up on your feet, and shout out

[Verse 2]
The kids out there don't know how to react
The streets are getting tough and that's a matter of fact
And I, I can't this any longer
But you can't make it on your own
The people there find it hard to relate
They don't know how it feels to be standing there on your own
Believe me, it's never too late
It's time to make a move, get up on your feet and shout

[Chorus 2]
Stop, look down, everybody, you see what's going on
Around you [x4]
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud [x2]

[Verse 3]
There are people who give and there are people who take
But I believe it's gonna get better
Realise what a difference you make
And don't turn away, Hey! I'm talking to you

[Bridge]
So there's only the one solution
Stop and think what's going on
You can draw your own conclusions
But you won't make it on your own

[Chorus 1]
Someone better tell the people up there
I think they ought to know, the bubble's just about to bust
Tell them they'd better beware
The word is on the street, get up on your feet, and shout

Stop, look down, everybody, you see what's going on
Around you [x4]
Stop, look down, look down, what's going on around you [x2]



Here comes the supernatural anaesthetist
If he wants you to snuff it
All he has to do is puff it
He's such a fine dancer



[Verse 1]
Love, love is a dream
We were like two young strands of driftwood
Caught up in the stream
We were destined for each other
From our very first hello
We came bustin' through that river dam
And made that river flow
We will sale upon the ocean
'Til the shoreline meets the sky
Carried on the first trade wind
That favours, you and I
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
But, darling this time we're on our way

[Chorus]
'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away

[Verse 2]
Life, oh, life is a chance
We were the only two who spun the wheel
And never scored romance
And if we'd stayed to play for fortune
We'd have broke the banks of gold
We'd have taken old Las Vegas
For every cent that she could hold
Love like ours was made in heaven
It was blessed by Lord above
We will spend our lives together
Forever hand in glove
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
But, darling this time we're on our way

[Chorus]
'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away



[Verse 1]
Well it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight
The villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me

[Chorus]
And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason i loved him too
And he never wondered what was right or wrong
He just knew - he just knew

[Verse 2]
Shadows and shape mixed together at dawn
But by time you catch them simplicity's gone
And so we sort through the pieces
My friends and i
Searching through the darkness to find
The breaks in the sky

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And we wonder, yes we wonder
How do you make sense of this
When the hero kills the maiden
With his kiss - with his kiss

[Outro]
Well it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight
The villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me
- if it were that simple for me



Well it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight
The villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me
And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered what was right or wrong
He just knew - he just knew
Shadows and shape mixed together at dawn
But by time you catch them simplicity's gone
And so we sort through the pieces
My friends and I
Searching through the darkness to find
The breaks in the sky
And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered what was right or wrong
He just knew - he just knew
And we wonder, yes we wonder
How do you make sense of this
When the hero kills the maiden
With his kiss - with his kiss
Well it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight
The villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me
- if it were that simple for me



While the city starts to sleep
She's watching over you
Smoke hangs on the downtown skyline
Moon pushes through
But some people's on fire tonight
Wind rushing round their feet
Someone's gonna sleep well tonight
Word is on the street

So high flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly here tonight

It's a tribal thing we're seeing
War paint on the face
A question of territory, pride and space
People strutting and feathers flying
It's a sorry scene
Someone's sleeping well tonight
Word is on the street

So high flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly here tonight

Brother, my brother
Don't let me down again
Mother oh mother
Wipe away your tears again

High flying bird embraced him
Held him to her breast
Soft feathers brushed his face
Finally came to rest
Gently rocking him to and fro
He quietly went to sleep
Someone's found a place of peace tonight
Word is on the street
So high flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly away tonight

High flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly safe tonight

[Verse]
Holy Mother, where are you?
Tonight I feel broken in two
I've seen the stars fall from the sky
Holy Mother, can't keep from crying

Oh, I need your help this time
Get me through this lonely night
Tell me, please, which way to turn
To find myself again

Holy Mother, hear my prayer
Somehow I know you're still there
Send me please some peace of mind
Take away this pain

I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you

Holy Mother, hear my cry
I've cursed your name a thousand times
I've felt the anger running through my soul
All I need is a hand to hold

Oh, I feel the end has come
No longer my legs will run
You know I would rather be
In your arms tonight

[Outro]
When my hands no longer play
My voice is still, I fade away
Holy mother, then I'll be
Lying in, safe within your arms



[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
I been stuck in the struggle
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in a tussle
Instead of usin' my muscle
And everytime I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game, now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
If a nigga pull my number if it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam'
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man, got us all programmed
I'ma pump my fist, I'm stayin' ready for this
And you can put this on Wish, I never seen the abyss
And when I needed a ride, you wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my Cris, you niggas all on my dick
I wanna change the world, you wanna change your life
I wouldn't a put up a fight if I knew it was trite
They say everything happen for a reason
Can you tell me why there's niggas bleedin'?
Needin' general assistance out here, needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet, but see, your brain is so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See, the real niggas ready out here taken control
See, I'm screamin' out Mo', with my pockets on swoll
Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' this stress to my spouse
'Cause I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out
If you niggas try to run up on the Bone
I'ma show you like this, I'ma pull out my chrome
I don't wanna have to send a nigga home
Lord, please take me home, come and take me home!

[Hook: Phil Collins]
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

[Interlude: Krazyie Bone]
Home, home, home, home, home
Home, home, home, home, home
Please take me home

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
When I'm lookin' at my money now
Thinkin' back to when I was livin' foul
I was runnin' wild, sur-vi-ving, 'cause I'm 9-to-5'ing
Even puttin' overtime if I had to grind
I was stayin' up, slangin' dubs, hangin' up on the block
Duckin' and dodgin' the cops clocked on the night-shift
Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto
But we finally made it
Stay dedicated to the music we made, yeah
Now it's on Bone Thug, leave alone
Came back the next year, #1 platinum song
It blew up from the door—and what do you know?
(Oh no) Eazy, rest his soul
Left us in the mess, I don't regret it
But we better get up and get it, go
Everything's gon' wrong, since you left Bone
It never been right, I knew it woulda been on
We woulda been tight, we woulda been in the zone
Ridin' so high, up in the game: five thugs live
See, we used to love makin' music
We was always in the studio, groovin'
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it
Right? But you know I'm goin' through it
And ain't feelin this rap thing right now
They got me trippin' ready to flip
They got me trippin' ready to come get my chips
They got me trippin' loadin' the clips
They trippin', Lord, I feel like I'm losin' it
Right now, right now, now, now

[Hook: Phil Collins]
So, take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
I'll never give in, I'll never give up
I'll let 'em live in, they sinnin', they pretend to be tough
Pretend to be tough, pretend to be blessed
They want money and women, it's never enough
They in a rush, hope nobody knows just too much
You better be good, you know up in the hood
And so, we give 'em the dough, fired out, laughin' up
When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
And to the grave, I been one of the brave
Not one of the slaves, one of the paid
And I'll be one of the same, stay hatin' the fake
On the television, runnin' around
Tellin' niggas be ready for hate
Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face
I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate
Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake
The smell of right it's all about guardin', guard the weak
Lost mommy, poppy left home
I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie
Sit list in the back tellin' his selection, his date is probly
Probly my mommy's song
Cryin' for the life of you gone
Just me and my destiny, let's roll, let's roll

[Hook: Phil Collins]
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
When I lost my Uncle Charle a part of me went wrong
And it happened when the Bone was comin' up so strong
We just wanted him to see what we do
You motivated us at the shows we see too
And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song
You mighta been through somethin', hopin' nothin' like Bone
Like one said we'll never make it
Like two, thirty mil in they faces
And I really thought it was over, put us on and you left
Crossed over, back to the hood, we soldiers
The music nigga make it back, scandalous
But faith kicked in and the work shows that we winnin' now
Gotta keep it comin' food in my baby mouth
And things have changed like relationships
Ain't did nothin', now you wanna flip
Suin' people thangs you would've never made on your own
Now I wanna stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood
Bye, think I'm home
Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone
You can really help a busta if it ain't meant to be
With a little oohwee, with a little oohwee
I'm tired of tryin' to help these thugs
Lord, just guide em' home, guide 'em home!

[Hook: Phil Collins]
So, take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
Ohhh Looord
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember



Creeping up the blind side, shinning up the wall
Stealing thru the dark of night
Climbing thru a window, stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces, putting them away
Something doesn't feel quite right

Help me someone, let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Coming out the woodwork, thru the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows but no substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sigh and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Sit down Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
Cos living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Sit down Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Sit down Sit down
Cos you won't get away
No with us you will stay
For the rest of your days - Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you



[Home By The Sea]
Home by the Sea (x4)

Creeping up the blind side, shinning up the wall
Stealing through the dark of night
Climbing into a window, stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces, putting them away
Something doesn't feel quite right

"Help me someone, let me out of here!"
'Cos out of the dark was suddenly heard
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

Coming out the woodwork, through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows but no substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sigh and they moan

"Help us someone, let us out of here!"
"'Cos living here so long undisturbed"
"Dreaming of the time we were free"
"So many years ago"
"Before the time when we first heard"
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

"Sit down, sit down!"
"Just sit down, sit down, sit down"
"Sit down!"
"As we relive our lives in what we tell you"
Oh whoa..

[Instrumental Break]

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom
Just waiting for that morning light
Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

"Help us someone, let us out of here!"
"'Cos living here so long undisturbed"
"Dreaming of the time we were free"
"So many years ago"
"Before the time when we first heard"
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

"Just sit down, sit down!"
"Just sit down, just sit down, just sit down!"
"Sit down!"
"As we relive our lives, in what we tell you"
"Aw please, let us relive our lives, in what we tell you"

"Just sit down, just sit down, just sit down"
"Sit down!"

"No you won't get away, 'cos with us you will stay"
"For the rest of your days, sit down!"

"As we relive our lives, in what we tell you!"
"Please, let us relive our lives, in what we tell you!"

[Second Home By The Sea]
[Instrumental]

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom
Just waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

"As we relive our lives in what we tell you"
Oh... (x3)



[Instrumental]



[Intro: DMX]
Sometimes
Sometimes you just know
You just know, that's all

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 1: DMX]
The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin' under
And you wonder why I pat you on your head and smile
Look in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you, and I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on yo' ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up, you see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas'll put a slug through you, over your ends
Cats I fucked with are real, but hey, those are your friends
It's just what you got comin', sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, yet you ask for more
Shut the casket door, this one here good as done
They thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah, it's gettin' closer

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 2: DMX]
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that and hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
It takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The Devil got a hold on me, and he won't let go
I can feel the Lord pullin', but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin', but we all do the losin'
It's just who does the choosin', is you goin' up or down?
What have you been provin'? Just that you were a fuckin' clown
Been seen the bullshit but never spoke on it
‘Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I was traded the chance of bein' a child with a father
For a talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night – come on!

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 3: DMX]
There's a lot of shit that I let slide, ‘cause it's outta my hands
Lot of niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
That a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue
Full moon, (ah-oo) – the howlin'
(Grr) – the growlin', (shh) – the prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need mo' love than an old thug
But hold up, roll up, talkin' out the side of your mouth
Is what's gonna let niggas know why you died in your house
While they lied to your spouse, told her it was suicide
But you and I both knew, the truth'll never die
Listen, nigga, if you scared, get a dog
But be prepared for the mob
‘Cause you dead up in the fog
And that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when it's there
This is hell and we're both here, can you feel it? Tell me yeah!

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming
In the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting
For this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on



[Verse 1]
When I opened your letter yesterday
I could not believe my eyes
Because I've already given all I have to give
And I think it must have slipped your mind
But I remember not so long ago
I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

[Verse 2]
Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand
They don't seem to realize
They're listening but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone
Because I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

[Chorus]
Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up
Over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
Because nothing can change all the things that you've done to me
Nothing can make me stay
Oh, Because you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

[Verse 3]
I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through
Never meant it to show
It started happening, that's all you know

[Bridge]
Oh, I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Hot sun beating down
Burning my feet just walking around
Hot sun making me sweat
Gator's getting close, hasn't got me yet

[Chorus]
I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

[Verse 2]
Blue jeans sitting on the beach
Her dog's talking to me but she's out of reach
Shes got a body under that shirt
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling

[Post-Chorus]
Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on

[Verse 3]
Young punk spilling beer on my shoes
Fat guys talking to me trying to steal my blues
Thick smoke, see her smiling through
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool

[Chorus]
But I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling

[Post-Chorus]
Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on
A perfect body with a perfect face — uh-huh

[Chorus]
No, I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way I walk
No, I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

[Outro]
But I can walk
No I can't dance
No no no I can't dance
No I said I can't sing
But I can walk



Hot sun, beating down
Burning my feet just walking around
Hot sun, is making me sweat
Gator's is getting close, hasn’t got me yet

I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can’t dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling, everything

Blue jeans sitting, on the beach
Her dog's talking to me but she's out of reach
She's got a body, under that shirt
But the only thing she'll rub is my face in the dirt

'Cause I can’t dance, I can’t talk
Only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can’t sing
I'm just standing here selling...
Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on

Young punk, he's spilling beer on my shoes
Fat guys talking to me trying to steal my blues
Thick smoke, see her smiling through
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool

’Cause I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling...
Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on

A perfect body with a perfect face — uh-huh

[Drum Break]

I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

I said I can't dance
I can't talk
I can't sing
I can't talk
Can't dance!
I said I can't dance
Can't dance (x2)
I won't dance, please don't ask me (x3)

I said I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything...
Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on

A perfect body with a perfect face — uh-huh

Uh (x7)

I said I can't dance!
I can't dance
And he can't dance! (x2)
He can dance, he can dance!
But we can't dance! (x2)
I said yeah! (x4)
We can't dance!



Sag allen hier ich bin unterwegs. Es gibt so viel Neues zu seh´n. Der Himmel ist blau, ich bin unterwegs und ich möchte gar nicht anderswo geh´n. Sag allen hier, ich bin unterwegs und ich liebe jeden kleinen Schritt. Und die Sonne, sie strahlt, ich bin unterwegs, dieses Lächeln geht stehts mit mir mit. Denn ich weiß genau, das wir uns bald wieder seh´n, egal wie weit entfernt wir auch sind. Und ihr lacht, wenn ihr Geschichten von uns hört - Oh, mein Herz so warm berührt. Sag ihnen, ich bin unterwegs, neue Freunde und Orte in Sicht. Ich schlaf ein unter den Sternen, die viel erzähl´n, und der Mond wacht ganz still über mich. Weder Regen noch der Schnee hält mich zurück, die Sonne scheint bald, du wirst seh´n. Und der Wind begleitet mich und singt ein Lied und ich sing mit, lässt mich immer, immer weitergeh´n. Ich bin unterwegs! Es gefällt mir! Ich bin unterwegs! Ich bin unterwegs! Ich bin unterwegs! Ich bin unterwegs! Sag allen hier, ich bin unterwegs und ich sehn mich so nach dem Ziel. Der Himmmel ist blau, ich bin unterwegs, gemeinsam erleben wir viel. Komm, sag allen hier, ich bin unterwegs, diesen Weg nach Haus find ich eh. Die Sonne, die strahlt, ich bin unterwegs und alles wird gut, du wirst seh´n. Ich bin unterwegs! ich bin unterwegs!

[Verse 1]
Well you can tell anyone I'm a down disgrace
Drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore
You can tell everybody about the state I'm in
You won't catch me crying 'cause I just can't win

[Verse 1]
It's over, oh yes it's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long
She said it, and now she'll regret it
But if she'd ask anyone
I know they'll tell her to her face, that it's too late

[Chorus]
Because I don't want to know
No, I don't want to know
She can cry all she wants
She's not going to bring me back, no no
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
She can try all she wants
It's not going to get me back, oh oh, no no

[Verse 2]
They warned me
Oh yes they all warned me
They told me, don't lose your heart to her
She'll never give it back, no no
Oh it's too late
She made a big mistake
It wouldn't be the first one anyway
Tell me how many more, no no no

[Chorus]
No I don't want to know (what she said)[x2]
She can cry all she wants
She's not going to bring me back, no no
I don't want to know (what she said)
No I don't want to know (what she said)
She can try all she wants
It's not going to get me back, oh oh, no no

[Verse 3]
It's over
Oh oh it's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long, oh oh
They warned me
Yes they all warned me
They told me, now don't lose your head to her
She'll never give it back, no no, no no

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
I don't want to see you go
There's too much to say
But it's gone on for too long
I know how much it hurts to hear
You show it and i know it
So there's no reason for the tears
I don't want to see you go
Don't want to see you cry
Cause i've been there and i know it
How much it hurts being left behind
If you hold on, just be strong
There will come a time

[Chorus]
All things will come to pass, you know
All things will come around

[Verse 2]
I see your bags are packed
I guess that means you won't be back
There's nothing left could keep me chained
To get you, bring you back again
If you hold on, won't be long
We'll find our time and place once more
Just hold tight, it's alright
We've been here before

[Chorus]

[Outro]
But if you don't want to stay, say goodbye
My number's on your wall
Cause i've been there and i've seen it
It's there beside those other guys
So keep it, you may need it
There's no more reason for the lies



Ooh yeah
You know I never wanted to be closer
And I'll still be here until it's over
No, no I never wanted to be closer
But you'll be back, I could've told you

Well I always knew
Yes I could see it coming
Your ambitious streak
You always want things beyond your reach
Well now you've got what you wanted
And you're free to be the things
You always said you'd be
You're up there looking down
Tell me what do you see - oh

Cos you know
You know I never wanted to be closer
And I'll still be here until it's over
No, no I never wanted to be closer
Yeah, but you'll be back, I could've told you

Well it seems to me
That you've got to fight for yourself
In this world we live in
It's dog-eat-dog and never give in
Why worry when you're holding the aces
Don't throw it away cos you know
I'd rather be you than me
Up there looking down
Tell me what do you see - oh

Hey hey yeah

Ooh yeah
You know I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)
And I'll still be here 'til it's over
No, no I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)
Ooh but you'll be back, I could've told you

It's been a long time coming
But at last we seem to be moving on, straight ahead
We're finally getting something done
Time flies and 'fore you know it
You'll be getting closer to where
You always knew you'd be
Up there looking down
Tell me what do you see - oh

Cos you know
No, no I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)
I'll still be here until it's over
No, you know I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)
Yeah but you'll be back, I could've told you

Hey hey yeah...



[Verse 1]
I read all the letters
I read each word that you've sent to me
And though it's past now
And the words start to fade
All the memories I have still remain

[Verse 2]
I've kept all the pictures
But I hide my feelings so no-one knows
Oh sure my friends all come round
But I'm in a crowd on my own
It's 'cos you're gone now
But your heart
Heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again

[Verse 3]
You see I'd heard the rumours
I knew before you let me know
But I didn't believe it, not you
No you would not let me go
Seems I was wrong, but I love
I love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away
Just remember...

[Chorus]
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder



(I go crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy...)

Feeling Like I do
Nothing's going to change my mind
Girl, when I see you
I want to lay my heart on the line
It's no infatuation
'Cause I feel it burning deep inside, come on
There's no need to fear
We can let our hearts collide
Attraction, reaction

Will I lose control
I go crazy
I just go crazy
'Cause I love you too much
'Cause I'm mad about you
You got to know
And you save me
You just amaze me
When I think of your touch
I go crazy
'Cause I'm bad without you, ooh
I go crazy
I just go crazy
'Cause I love you too much
I go crazy
'Cause I'm mad without you
Will I love you more
Every night and day

I imagine you into my future
You and I in love
Making dreams come true of us together
Girl, it makes me nervous
'Cause I know you're not my very own, not just yet
Saw you yesterday
You were with somebody else
Distraction, reaction

Feeling like a child, I'm so free and wild with you
Then you walk away, tell me you can't stay
Will I lose control



I got something
You never never never had before
I got something
I never never never gave away before
No other woman can give it to you
No other woman can do what I do
No other woman no no
I got something
I know you've been around man
You've had you shares of ups and downs
Been through to many lovers
Had a taste but never a bite
But look here
What I got for you
It's love and it's true true true
I got something
I got something...
Some say you've seen it all
That you were the first man on then moon
That you've got tired of flying
And ended up not really doing a thing
You talk a lot about your friends
How influential some of them are
Forget your hot connections
You don't have to sell it to me
But look here
What I got for you
It's love and it's true true true
I got something
I got something



I can see that it won't be long
You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed and your words, they lie
That's something you can't deny

I call, you're not at home
You're home, but you're not alone
If you wanna leave then why don't you say it
Your love has gone anyway

I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on

I know a good thing must come to an end
But it's hard to take losing a friend
I know what you think and what's in your mind
So darling, look, why pretend

I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
It won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on

I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
It won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on

I know there's something
I know there's something
I know there's something
I know there's something
I know there's something
I know there's something
(I know there's something)



It's one o'clock and time for lunch
Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum-dum
When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk

There's always been Ethel
"Jacob, wake up, you've got to tidy your room now"
And then Mister Lewis
"Isn't it time that he was out on his own?
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds, cuckoo to you
Keep them moving blades sharp

I know what I like and I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show

Sunday night, Mister Farmer called, said
"Listen, son, you're wasting your time, there's a future for you
In the fire escape trade, come up to town
But I remembered a voice from the past
"Gambling only pays when you're winning
I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure
Keep them mowing blades sharp

I know what I like and I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show

When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk
Me, I'm just a lawnmower, you can tell me by the way I walk



[Intro]
It's one o'clock and time for lunch
Bum de dum de dum
When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk

[Verse 1]
There's always been Ethel
"Jacob, wake up, you've got to tidy your room now!"
And then Mister Lewis
"Isn't it time that he was out on his own?"
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds, cuckoo to you
Keep them mowing blades sharp

[Chorus]
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show
Your show

[Verse 2]
Sunday night, Mr. Farmer called, said
"Listen son, you're wasting time
There's a future for you in the fire escape trade
Come up to town"

But I remembered the voice from the past
"Gambling only pays when you're winning!"
I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure
Keep them mowing blades sharp

[Chorus]
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show

Yeah, I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show

[Outro]
When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk
Me, I'm just a lawnmower
You can tell me by the way I walk



[Verse 1]
I look out the window every day, i see the world go by
Watching i sit and wait for you
Just hoping you'll catch my eye
You see me stare but i don't care
I like the way you smile
One day i'll get to talk to you
Ooh, right now well i'm too shy

[Chorus]
But in my world of make believe
You're the one what i need, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I could imagine me with you
But it's an impossibility
I'd love to try to realise, i gotta deal with reality
But if you turn my way, i'd look away, ooh even face-to-face
And deep inside me, inside my mind
Someone else is trying to take my place

[Chorus]
But in my world of make believe
You're the one what i need, oh, oh...
Oh, come with me, i'll show you everything
Come with me, ooh
Come with me, i'll show you everything
It could be, come along with me and let me take you there, oh, oh...

[Verse 3]
I look out the window every day, i see the world go by
Watching i sit and wait for you
Ooh, just hoping that you'll walk by
But if you turn my way, i'd look away, ooh even face-to-face
And deep inside, ooh in my mind
Someone else is trying to take my place

[Chorus]
In my world of make believe
You're the one what i need, oh, oh
Come with me, ooh
Come with me, i'll show you everything
It could be, come along with me and let me take you there, oh, oh

[Outro]
All of my life, come with me, come with me, come with me
All of my life
I like the way you smile
All of my life



Got out of bed, wasn't feeling too good
With my wallet and my passport, a new pair of shoes
The sun is shining so I head for the park
With a bottle of Tequila, and a new pack of cigarettes

I got a cousin and she got a friend
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help
At his apartment I knocked on the door
He wouldn't come out until he got paid

Now don't tell anybody what I wanna do
If they find out you know that they'll never let me through

It's no fun being an illegal alien, no
It's no fun being an illegal alien

Down at the office had to fill out the forms
A pink one, a red one, the colours you choose
Up to the counter to see what they think
They said 'It doesn't count man, it ain't written in ink'

I don't trust anybody, least not around here, cos

It's no fun being an illegal alien, I tell ya
It's no fun being an illegal alien, no no no no no
It's no fun being an illegal alien, I mean it when I tell ya that
It's no fun being an illegal alien
An illegal alien, O.K

Consideration for your fellow man
Would not hurt anybody, it sure fits in with my plan
Over the border, there lies the promised land
Where everything comes easy, you just hold out your hand

Keep your suspicions, I've seen that look before
But I ain't done nothing wrong now
Is that such a suprise?
But I've got a sister who'd be willing to oblige
She will do anything now to help me get to the outside

So don't tell anybody what I wanna do
If they find out you know that they'll never let me through

It's no fun being an illegal alien, I tell ya
It's no fun being an illegal alien, and it's getting me down
It's no fun being an illegal alien, no no no no no
It's no fun being an illegal alien, yeah yeah yeah

It's no fun (not much fun) being an illegal alien, I tell ya that
It's no fun being an illegal alien, I tell ya

It's no fun being an illegal alien, no no no no
It's no fun (not much fun) being an illegal alien, no no no
It's no fun (not bloody much fun) being an illegal alien
It's no fun being an illegal alien, and that's what I am



[Verse 1]
So you finally came right out and said it girl
What took you so long
It was in your eyes, that look's been there for far too long
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

[Chorus]
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
I think about it from time to time
When I'm lonely and on my own

[Verse 2]
I try to forget and yet, still rush to the telephone
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

[Chorus]
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh

[Verse 3]
Well it feels like something you want so bad
Then you think you've got it, but it's something you already had
You can feel it all around you, but it's something you just can't touch
And I feel it coming at me
I can feel it coming at me

[Chorus]
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh

[Bridge]
I'm waiting in line, but would you say if I was wasting my time

[Chorus]
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh



[Verse 1]
If you feel it do it
You don't need a reason
For all you know it could be good for you
To show your feelings
Don't just leave them
Do the things you believe in, it's alright
Don't worry turn around, I will still be here

[Chorus]
I'm not moving...no really
You just try and push me out
No, I'm not moving...no really
No, I'm not going anywhere tonight

[Verse 2]
If you think it, say it
No-one can stop you
Don't keep quiet, just
'Cos you think you ought to
Feel free to shout it loud
Speak your mind, spit it out

[Chorus]
I'm not moving...no really
You just try and push me out
No I'm not moving
No really, there's no hurry I can sit it out
So don't worry turn around, I will still be here

[Verse 3]
If it hurts don't do it
'Cos no-one can take you make you drink
And no-one can tell you what you think
Remember if your spirit starts to sink
Don't you worry turn around, I will still be here



TARZAN
Will someone tell me where I belong?
Where I should go?
Can someone tell me where I'm going wrong?
I need to know

Why would I hurt the ones I love?
Why would I hurt you?
If I can't be what he wants of me
What am I to do?
When will I be me
The son that he can't see?
There must be somebody who understands

Out there, somewhere

When will I find home?
A place where I belong?
Surely there must be more like me
Out there, somewhere

There must be somebody just like me
Out there...



[Verse 1]
Every single time
You take me out with you
You always flirt around
With someone new
But I never criticize
The tearful things you do
Cause I'm so afraid
Of losing you

[Chorus]
But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
Cause I just lock my door
And let myself go and
Lay right down and cry

[Verse 2]
Every place we go
People are whispering
About your flirting ways
And it hurts me so to hear
Oh but in the public's eye
I just push behind
All my hurt inside
And pretend I don't mind

[Outro]
But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
In my lonely room (Your my lonely room)
Tears I don't have to hide (Tears I don't have to hide)
In my lonely room (Your my lo... In my lonely room)
Tears I don't have to hide (I don't have to hide...)



INSIDE

Seems they're letting him out next year
He's behaving himself I hear
Governor Conway says it will be fine
Just as long as he can tow the line

It's the same old story
But it says here "Mum you're not to worry"
'Cos some you lose and some you lose

At the party, he was on his own
All he did was say he'd take her home
But it seems they didn't go straight there
'twas on the porch, she told him
"put your hand here"

Yes it's that same old story
They told her mum she's not to worry

Police 'If what she says is so
We'll never let him go!'

Him : "Never a word could be heard
Not even the sound of a bird
Singing it over again, telling a different story
Never the same as before
See the summer going out by the door"
Brother and now that you've paid for those lies
Get another disguise

"It's twenty years now since our Kid came free
Oh I remember August '53
But it wasn't quite like they said
With that behind you, you can't plan ahead
So it's the same old story
They say you're free, don't worry
What they said's not so
They never let you go!"

Him : "Never a word could be heard
Not even the sound of a bird
Singing it over again, telling a different story
Never the same as before
See the summer going out by the door"
Brother and now that you've paid for those lies
Get another disguise


OUT



[Chorus]
Inside out, ooh you got me inside out
Oh inside out, oh inside out

[Verse 1]
Now everybody keeps on telling me how to be
And everybody tells me do what they say
Oh I'll help myself it's up to me and no-one else
But till I'm ready just keep out of my way

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now everybody's got me running round, up and down
And here I am going out of my mind
But I won't lose sight of all the, the things I'm looking for
They're coming to me and I'm taking what's mine

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'll play the game
We'll make the same mistakes
It's all the same
If we can give and take
Hold on, hold on, ooh
Hold on, hold on, ooh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All of my life I've been searching and hanging on
Turning a corner, never know what I'd find
But now I'm back again like I never went away
Ooh let me in I'm through with wasting my time

[Outro]
Inside out, ooh you got me inside out
Oh inside out, oh inside out
Oh inside out, ooh you got me inside out
Oh inside out, oh inside out



[Instrumental]



[Chorus]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 1]
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend

But the hurt doesn't show; but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you or me

[Verse 1: Bure]
Voices in my head
Tearing my thoughts to shreads
They be telling me to jump off a cliff
So I go ahead
And then I end up dead
There is no where that I belong
Spitting facts on a Phil Collins song
Ain't nothing that I can do for us
So Imma let my favorite singer hop on the chorus

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 2: Bure]
I ain't in my feelings, I'm just reminiscing
Taking it back and I'm missing all the good ol' days
When I made it out the maze
When I set shit ablaze
Use it in my old ways
I don't wanna be the villain
I need to stop killing all these dreams
'Cause they tearing at the seams
And I just wanna stay out of prison
Got these answers blowing in the wind like I'm Bob Dylan
I remember when I went too far
They was flashing lights like a movie star
That was unforgivable
I was unlivable
I was spotted like a jaguar
Playing people like a motherfucking guitar
I was on everybody's radar
I got the scars to show for that
Wish I could chauffeur that
And crash it right into the Death Star

[Chorus: Phil Collins (Bure)]
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, (oh Lord) oh Lord
Well I’ve been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 3: Bure]
In My Feelings is a testimony
To all I've done wrong
That's why I sing this song
I'm a man of God
No, he ain't giving me a nod 'cause I've comitted fraud
I wanna do right by him, right by others and most of all right by me
I wanna do right by my kids, for my kids' kids, we'll just have to wait and see
Family is the the most important thing
The happiness they bring is unmatched
With some of them, I feel so detached
The others they just think I'm funny like King Bach
Two sides to me, Ona and Bure
One stay quiet, the other say hooray
A fire under me, somebody ignites

[Drum solo]
I gotta lotta stuff blowing in the air tonight
Yeah

[Chorus]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord

[Outro: Phil Collins]
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord



[Intro]
What we gonna do right here is go back (go back)
Way back (way back)- back into time (into time)

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Keep still in the shit, killin the rhyme
The Queen stay poppin the wine and cockin the nine
For those who think they stoppin my dough
Wanna copy my show, wha
I'm switchin my flow, can't take it no mo'
Oh you think I'm playin around
I'm layin ya down
Album drop, new millenium shuttin it down
Better off givin it up, I'm rippin it up
Spendin money, livin it up, not givin a fuck
Hiding the tote, runnin the coast
Makin niggas catch the Holy Ghost
I'm realer than most, wha
The trendsetter, the Brooklyn repper
You know the routine
Smoke you like a ciggarette-r
We've been, out in a bit
Y'all still talkin shit
Ain't that a bitch?
What part of the game was this?
Millions I'm holdin'
Drop tops rollin'
Diamonds on my neck
And Bentley ballin'
Me and my niggas gettin' high all day
Straight to the top, cuz we on our way
Comin' for y'all, comin' for y'all
That's right I got something for y'all
Something for y'all, wha
God bless me, look at all I've been through
It's my time, I can feel it, can't you?

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well I remember

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Back when it used to be the eighties
Said the world was gon' end in 2000 (that's crazy)
I'm the only thing to fear
For the new year
New year, and if BIG was here (woo)
Get the fans, we the ones to talk
We die real on the streets
So watch where you walk
And you can find me, usually
Talkin' dirty to a cat thugged out
Or even kinda nerdy
Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease and JM
Taking over like a plague on a town
All y'all can do is pray and watch it go down
Like when the ball drop
My fam's all I got, we keep it gangsta
Comin' for y'all, comin' for y'all
That's right I got something for y'all
Something for y'all, wha
God bless me, look at all I've been through
It's my time, I can feel it, can't you?

[Verse 3: Phil Collins]
Well, if you told me, you were drowning
I would not a lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
Saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

I got sunshine in my stomach
Like I just rocked my baby to sleep
I got sunshine in my stomach
But I can't keep me from creeping sleep
Sleep, deep in the deep

Rockface moves to press my skin
White liquids turn sour within
Turn fast-turn sour
Turn sweat-turn sour
Must tell myself that I'm not here
I'm drowning in a liquid fear
Bottled in a strong compression
My distortion shows obsession
In the cave
Get me out of this cave

If I keep self-control
I'll be safe in my soul
And the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns
My spirit just never learns

Stalactites, stalagmites
Shut me in, lock me tight
Lips are dry, throat is dry
Feel like burning, stomach churning
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room
Body stretching, feel the wretching
In the cage
Get me out of this cage

In the glare of a light
I see a strange kind of sight;
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far;
All tied to their things
They are netted by their strings
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings

Outside the cage I see my Brother John
He turns his head so slowly round
I cry out help! before he can be gone
And he looks at me without a sound
And I shout 'John please help me!'
But he does not even want to try to speak
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek
And I watch him turn away and leave the cage
My little runaway

(Raindrops keep falling on my head, they keep falling on my...)

In a trap, feel a strap
Holding still. Pinned for kill
Chances narrow that I'll make it
In the cushioned straight-jacket
Just like 22nd Street
When they got me by my neck and feet
Pressure's building, can't take any more
My headaches charge, my earaches roar
In this pain
Get me out of this pain

If I could change to liquid
I could fill the cracks up in the rock
But I know that I am solid
And I am my own bad luck
But outside John disappears and my cage dissolves
And without any reason my body revolves

Keep on turning
Keep on turning
Turning around
Just spinning around



[In the Cage]
I got sunshine in my stomach
Like I just rocked my baby to sleep
I got sunshine in my stomach
But I can't keep me from creeping sleep
Deep, deep in the deep

Rockface moves to press my skin
White liquid turn sour within
Turn fast - turn sour
Turn sweat - turn sour
Must tell myself that I'm not here
I'm drowning in a liquid fear
Bottled in a strong compression
My distortion shows obsession

In this cave, oh
Get me out of this cave, oh

If I keep my self-control
I'll be safe in my soul
In the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns
My spirit just, just, just, just never learns

Stalactites, stalagmites
They lock me in, held me tight
Lips are dry, throat is dry
Feel like burning, stomach churning
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room
Body stretching, feel the wretching

In this cage, oh
Get me out of this cage, oh

But in the glare of a light
I see a strange kind of sight;
Cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far;
All tied to their things
They're netted by their strings
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings
Their wasted wings

[Keyboard Solo (Tony Banks)]

Outside the cage, I see my Brother John
He turns his head so slowly round
I cry out Help! before he can be gone
And he looks at me without a sound

So I shout out "John, please help me!"
But he does not even want to try to speak
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood, dribbles down his cheek
And I watch him turn again and leave the cage
My little runaway...

Rain drops keep falling on my head, they keep falling on my
Rain drops keep falling on my head, they keep falling on my
Rain drops keep falling on my head, they keep falling on my
Rain drops keep falling on my head, they keep falling on my head

In a trap, feel a strap
Pinned for fear, dressed for kill
Chances narrow that I'll make it
In the cushioned straight-jacket
Just like 22nd Street
They got me by my neck and feet
Pressures building, can't take more
Headaches charge, my earaches roar

In this pain, oh
Get me out of this pain, oh

But if I could change to liquid
I could fill the cracks up in the rocks
I know that I am solid
And I am my own bad luck
Outside John disappears, my cage dissolves
Without any reason my body revolves

Keep on turning
Keep on turning
Keep on turning
Keep on turning, turning, turning
Turning, turning, keep on turning round, round, round, round, round, round, round!

(Round... Round... Round.. Round...)
Round!

Somebody, somebody get me out of this cage
Oh, get me out of this cage
Oh, get me out of this cage

Moving down the water
John is drifting out of sight
It's only at the turning point
That you find out how you fight

In the cold, feel the cold
All around
And the rush of crashing water
Surrounds me with its sound

Striking out to reach you
I can't get through to the other side
When you're racing in the rapids
There's only one way, that's to ride

Taken down, taken down by the undertow
I'm spiraled down the river bed, my fire is burning low
Catching hold of a rock that's firm, I'm waiting for John to be carried past
We hold together, hold together and shoot the rapids fast

And when the waters slow down, the dark and the deep
Have no one, no one, no one, no one, no one left to keep
Hang on John, we're out of this at last
Something's changed, that's not your face, it's mine
It's mine!



All that time I was searching with nowhere to run to
It started me thinking, wondering
What I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers

Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

[Chorus]
Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Ooh, you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to

I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

[Chorus]
Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself, oh
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else

[Chorus]
Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
You know I love you but I just can't take this

[Verse 1]
I know something about
Opening windows and doors
I know how to move quietly
To creep across creaky wooden floors
I know where to find precious things
In all your cupboards and drawers

[Chorus 1]
Slipping the clippers
Slipping the clippers through the telephone wires
A sense of isolation
Inspires, inspires me

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I like to feel the suspense
When I'm certain you know I am there
I like you lying awake
Your bated breath charging the air
I like the touch and the smell
Of all the pretty dresses you wear

[Chorus 2]
Intruder's happy in the dark
Intruder come
Intruder come and he leave his mark
Leave his mark, leave his mark

[Interlude]

[Outro]
I am the intruder



Video Watch "In tuo figlio" Video Video
Avrai forza per lottare
Sarai saggio per decidere
Quando il tuo momento arriverà
Perché è in questo tuo vagare
Che risposte troverai
Sarai tu sulla montagna
E tu che in cima andrai

Figlio di chi è padre ormai
Libero camminerai
E quando un padre tu sarai
In tuo figlio un padre scoprirai

E anche se sarai da solo
I dubbi vincerai
È di sola andata il viaggio
Da un ragazzo un uomo sarai

Figlio di chi è padre ormai
Libero camminerai
E quando un padre tu sarai
In tuo figlio un padre scoprirai

Imparerai insegnando
E imparando insegnerai
Finchè l'amore un giorno incontrerai
Tutti i sogni che hai sognato
E le tue fantasie
Non per molto lo saranno
Questo tempo vola via

Figlio di chi è padre ormai
Libero camminerai
E quando un padre tu sarai
In tuo figlio un padre scoprirai
E tuo figlio, e tuo figlio
È padre già da un po'



Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long
But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, ooh now I know
She has a built in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

Well I don't really know her, I only know her name
But she crawls under your skin, you're never quite the same, and now I know
She's got something you just can't trust
It's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

She don't like losing, to her it's still a game
And though she will mess up your life
You'll want her just the same, and now I know
She has a built in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

She seems to have an invisible touch...

[Verse 1]
Back in my schooldays, acting the fool days
One and one and one makes three
And a man said: "Kid, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time."

Armour clad horses riding Trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didn't wanna be a part of the great debate on moonshine

[Chorus]
Stop pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice. You're out of your head
Said: "Stop, hold the phone, this has to be
Cut to the bone". Too bad, I see red
I see red, I see red, I see red

[Verse 2]
When the sly man stumbles, twists and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
And he sets his face towards the far horizon
Won't you come this way, can't you go that way
But his rhythm don't miss a beat
'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving

[Chorus]
Stop pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice. You're out of your head
Said: "Stop, hold the phone, this has to be
Cut to the bone". Too bad, I see red
I see red, I see red, I see red

[Verse 3]
So, who wants a riot?
People should be quiet
Don't we give them good T. V.?
You can learn to love your lifetime of distraction
Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside
All the way from A to Z
I can live without that kind of satisfaction

[Chorus]
Stop pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice. You're out of your head
Said: "Stop, hold the phone, this has to be
Cut to the bone". Too bad, I see red
I see red, I see red, I see red



When it's cold, it come slow
It is warm, just watch it grow
All around me
It is here, it is now

Just a little bit of it, can bring you up or down
Like the supper, it is cooking in your hometown
It is chicken, it is eggs
It is in between your legs
It is walking on the moon
Leaving your cocoon

It is the jigsaw, it is purple haze
It never stays in one place, but it's not a passing phase
It is in the single's bar, in the distance of the face
It is in between the cages, it is always in a space
It is here, it is now

Any rock can be made to roll
If you've enough of it to pay the toll
It has no home in words or goal
Not even in your favourite hole
It is the hope for the dope
When you ride the horse without a hoof
It is shaken, not stirred;
Cocktails on the roof

When you eat right fruit you see everything alive
It is inside spirit, with enough grit to survive
If you think that it's pretentious, you've been taken for a ride
Look across the mirror sonny, before you choose decide
It is here, it is now

It is real
It is Rael

'Cos it's only knock and know all, but I like it



[Chorus 1]
So you think you are something special?
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could admit, you are something special
Will you tell me, girl? I would love to know

[Verse 1]
Yes, I have seen you with your other girlfriends
I can tell they really think you are fine
And I have seen you with your other men friends
They do not know if you are a love of mine

[Chorus 2][x2]
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I have got to know just how you feel, baby
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I have got to know just how you feel, baby

[Verse 2]
Because you have taken away
The only thing I ever ever had
Don't you know that I love you?
Why would you make me feel bad?
Because the only thing I ever loved
Was loving you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
What makes you think you are something special?



[Chorus 1]
Well it don't matter to me what you say, what you say
And it don't matter to me what you're doing alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Because I've heard it all so many times before
Just what you're saying and
I don't really want to hear it all no more, no more
Don't want to hear it no more

[Chorus 2]
Because there's no way that you can run
Because I'm going to find you
And there's nobody that you can turn to
Because I'll be behind you just to remind you

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
It seems to me it's been too easy for you for too long
So you'd better climb down before you fall and hurt your pride, your pride
You're going to hurt your pride

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][Repeat until fade]



It can be in the way you're walking
When you don't know where you're going too
It's in the way you make love to your lady friend
Some people can sit still, and you can tell they got it
If you can't ask, you can smile while you pretend
Oh, yeah, yeah, look around, it's everywhere
Oh, yeah, yeah, you can find it, it's everywhere

It could be in the way you wear clothes when you going out at night
It could be in the way you tip your hat to a passer by
It could be in the way you hold someone's hand so tight
It could be the way you kiss a long long lost friend goodbye
Oh, yeah, yeah, look around, it's everywhere
You almost touch it
Oh, yeah, yeah, you can find it, it's everywhere

I just remember it's not how smooth you move
It's what you can't see
Touching somebody's heart
Just reach out, it's everywhere
Reach out and touch
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, listen

It could be in the way you put your arm around someone to give them some comfort
It can be in the things you say to show you care
It can be in the way you talk to your loved one on the phone
It can be in the way you run your fingers thru her hair
Oh, yeah, yeah, look around, it's everywhere
So strong you can almost touch it
Oh, yeah, yeah, you can fint it, it's everywhere

Check it out people, you know it's everywhere
It's no mystery you can findit, if you're looking, you know it's everywhere
Remember it's what you can't see, the touch of somebody's heart
Just reach out, it's everywhere
Yeah, yeah, it's everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
It's everywhere, it's just a feeling, people you know
It's everywhere
Reach out and touch
Reach out and touch
It's everywhere



Reach out, hands in the air
Don't care just what they're saying
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope
That it's gonna get better
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me
Everything's gonna come around
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me
Someone's gonna see

Well, he calls me over and he calls me brother and I know
Always fighting and moonlighting and
Well, it never ends in the city if you're all alone
There's a sister and she's standing next to her man
In the darkness you feel the sharpness of steel
And it's always there, in the city, and you're all alone

Reach out, hands in the air
Don't care just what they're saying
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope
That it's gonna get better
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me
Everything's gonna come around
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me
Someone's gonna see

If it's gonna get better, it starts with a feeling
If it's gonna get better, it's gonna take time
If it's gonna get better, we gotta start now
'Cause I know, everybody can feel it
And I know, everybody will see it
'Cause it shows, and that shows I'm not dreaming
'Cause you know, and I know it's time for a change



[Verse 1]
It's in your eyes
The love you hide away
You can't disguise
The things you feel, the thing you say

[Chorus 1]
If you just call my name
Any time at all, I'll be there

[Verse 2]
I don't know why
The way you're falling away from me
I can't describe
It's how it feels, it's what I see

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
I look around, all I see is you
But you gotta tell me that you want me too
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
I can't disguise
The love I wait for you to share
I can't deny
If you reach out and touch my hand it's there

[Chorus 1]



[Verse 1]
Gently rolling Father time
Is calling to him now
And though he hears him
He looks out to sea
Somewhere out there lie his dreams
A story with no ending
And till he finds his answers
He won't be going nowhere

[Chorus]
For him, it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late

[Verse 2]
Quietly knocking on her door
He patiently stands waiting
And though she hears him
She sits steadfast in her chair
Somewhere out there never seen
Her hopes and dreams lie waiting
And till she finds an answer
She won't be going nowhere...

[Chorus]
For her, it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late

[Bridge]
For everything we know that's certain
There is much we cannot see
So we choose to close the curtain
Never knowing what could have been
It's not too late, it's not too late, never too late

[Verse 3]
Slowly rocking the baby's bed
He strokes it's head and whispers
And though it hears him
It keeps smiling and kicks it's feet
Somewhere out there is a life
A lifetime made for living
So it holds on fast, it ain't going nowhere

[Outro][x2]
For some it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late
For some it's not too late
It's not too late
For some its never too late



With a young man, with his heart on his sleeve
Had the body of a man and a trust of a child
He never meant to hurt anybody
But he broke some hearts along the way
Oh, it's all over, oh, it's all done
Oh, well, it's all over, or has it just begun?
All that he spoke came right from his heart
Though some had been hurt by the things he had said
Go walking in the long grass to find his peace
Sometimes it'd grow so tall he'd lose his way
Oh, now it's all over, oh, it's all done
Oh, it's all over, or has it just begun?
Oh, it's all over, oh, it's all done
Oh, it's all over or has it just begun?



[Verse 1]
With a young man, with his heart on his sleeve
Had the body of a man, and a trust of a child
He never meant to hurt anybody
But he broke some hearts along the way

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's all over
Ooh, it's all done
Ooh, it's all over
Or, has it just begun?

[Verse 2]
All that he spoke came right from his heart
Though some had been hurt by the things he had said
Go walking in the long grass to find his peace
Sometimes it'd grow so tall he'd lose his way

[Chorus][x2]
Ooh, now it's all over
Ooh, it's all done
Ooh, it's all over
Or, has it just begun?



Stepping out the back way
Hoping nobody sees
Feeling can be easy
Think how I feel

What will (can) you say?
What will you do?
Why can't you see?
It's yourself I love

Don't you know I'm not asking
You must have made up your mind
Is it worth the pain you're causing
To those you're leaving behind

What will you say?
What will you do?
Why can't you see?
It's yourself I love

Don't you know I'd like some answers
You could give me a call
I hardly know the reason
And I really feel no good at all

Where will you go?
Where will you be?
Where can I try?
It's yourself I love



[It]
When it's cold, it come slow
When it's warm, just watch it grow
All around me
It is here, it is now

Just a little bit of it, can bring you up or down
Like the supper, it is cooking in your hometown
It's supper, it is eggs
It is in between your legs
It is walking on the moon

If you think this is pretentious, and you've been taken for a ride

It is here, it is now
It is real, this is Rael

Yes, you know what we know
That it's only knock and know all, but we like it!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
Oh yes, we like it!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
Yeah!

It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all!
It's only knock and know all, but we like it!
Thank you, cheer!

(Instrumental)



I've been trying
Lord knows that I've been trying
To understand why
Can't I be your only man

Now you said you loved me
So sincerely
That I believed that you loved me
Yet I can't understand why
Can't I be your only man

Day after day you
Ya Treat me any old way
I wanna go but my heart says no
Acting so strange
But my love still remains
So keep on trying boy
She's gonna change

Day after day you
Ya Treat me any old way
I wanna go but my heart says no
Acting so strange
Yet my love still remains
It says keep on trying boy
She's gonna change

Now, I've been trying
Lord knows how I've been trying
But I can't understand why
Can't I be your only man

I just keep on trying
Oooh...ohoooh...
Just keep on trying...
Oooh...ohoooh...
Ya gotta keep on trying
Oooh...ohoooh...



[Verse 1]
I've forgotten everything about you
Until someone says your name
I've forgotten all the reasons I loved you
Until someone tells me that you rang

[Chorus]
The memories are hazy now
I don't recall at all
There's nothing, there's nothing there
Just me
And I don't understand why

[Verse 2]
I can't recollect my feelings
Until someone mentions that they saw you
I really don't remember all the things you said
Until someone shows me where you live

[Chorus]
Why is everything so hazy now
I don't recall at all
There's nothing, there's nothing there
Just me
And I don't understand why

[Bridge]
I can't recall your smile
The touch of your hand holding mine
And I can't remember why
Holding you seemed so right
Oh

[Chorus]
The memories, they're hazy now
I don't recall at all
There's nothing, there's nothing there
Just me
And I don't understand why

[Outro]
I've forgotten everything about you
Until someone says your name
I've forgotten all those reasons i loved you
Until someone tells me that you rang
Oh
Oh



[Verse 1]
You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend, yeah, mmm
All this time I've stayed out of sight
I started wondering why, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I, oh now I wish it would rain (Girl, I wish it would rain)
Rain down on me (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, I wish)
Oh now I wish it would rain (Yeah)
Rain down on me (La da da da da da)

[Verse 2]
You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh, I guess you were right, yeah yeah
Ooh, I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh now, oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Down on me, yeah, oh, how I wish)
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Da da da da da)
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Rain down on me)
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Brothers, won't you help me sing this song?)

[Bridge]
Though your hurt is gone
Mine's hangin' on inside
And I know, it's getting me through this
I've waited, and waited on your side
'Cause I know, I know (I know)
I know I never meant to, never meant to
Never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again
Rain, yeah
Rain down on me
Da da da da da da

[Chorus]
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me
Rain down, rain down on me, yeah
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me

[Outro]
I wish, I wish it would rain
It would rain down on me
Rain, yeah
Oh now I wish it would rain
Oh...oh...wish it would rain, yeah



[Verse 1]
You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

[Chorus]
Now I... ooh, now I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain... rain down on me now
Ooh, now I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain on me

[Verse 2]
You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh, I guess you were right
Ooh, I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again

[Chorus]
Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain... rain down on me now
Ooh, but I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain on me

[Bridge]
Though your hurt is gone, mine's hanging on inside
And I know... it's eating me through, it's eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign
'Cause I know, I know... I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again

[Chorus]
Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down... down on me
Ooh, you know I wish it would rain... rain down on me now
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain down... down on me
Yes, you know I wish it would rain down.. rain down over me

[Outro]
Just rain down over me
Just let it rain down, let it rain down
Let it rain down, oh yeah
Let it rain down, rain down over me
Just let it rain down, just let it rain down
Let it rain down
Just let it rain



[Intro: Jamie Morton]
Sig til de andre, at jeg' på vej
Der er venner og ting, jeg ska' se
Min himmel er blå, nu er jeg på vej
Og jeg glæder mig til det, der skal ske

[Omkvæd 1: Stig Rossen]
Sig til de andre, at jeg' på vej
Og jeg nyder hvert et skridt, jeg ta'r
Der er sol overalt, nu er jeg på vej
Og jeg smiler til alt det, jeg har

[Vers 1: Stig Rossen]
Det er dejligt at rejse af sted med en ven
Til trods for at vi langt fra er ens
Og historier fra vores rejse spreder smil
Og mit hjerte svæver op

[Omkvæd 2: Stig Rossen]
Så sig til dem, at jeg' på vej
Jeg takker for alt det, jeg ser
I den stjerneklare nat holder månen vagt
Så hvordan ku' man ønske sig mer'?

[Vers 3: Stig Rossen]
Hverken sne eller regn ka' ryste mig
For solen vil snart skinne her
Og den sommerlune vind mod din kind gi'r hjertet vinger
Og nu er jeg, hvor jeg helst vil vær'

[Kontraststykke: Stig Rossen]
Og jeg er på vej nu
Uden tøven
Jeg er på vej nu

[Fløjtesolo: Stig Rossen]
Jeg er på vej nu
Jeg er på vej nu
Jeg er på vej nu

[Omkvæd: Stig Rossen]
Sig til de andre (sig til de andre), at jeg' på vej (at jeg' på vej)
Jeg vil ud og finde mit sted (jeg vil finde mit sted)
Min himmel er blå, nu er jeg på vej
Og glæden og lykken er nær (glæden er nær)
Så sig til de andre, at jeg' på vej (jeg er på vej)
Og jeg ved, at rejsen bli'r nem (ved, at rejsen bli'r nem)
Der er sol overalt, nu er jeg på vej
Og nu vil jeg finde mit hjem

[Outro: Stig Rossen & Jamie Morton]
Jeg er på vej
Ja, jeg er på vej



Koda parle : Si tu tiens vraiment à savoir comment ma mère
Et moi avons été séparés, je gardais l'histoire pour le
Rendez-vous des saumons mais je te la raconte si tu veux...
...Il me semble que c'était le 5e ou 6e jour le plus froid
De toute ma vie...
Kinaï : Oh ! Très intéressant, garde ça pour plus tard

Koda : Tu crois ?
Kinaï : Oh oui... pour tes amis !!

Kinaï : Arrête ça ! Tu vas te taire ! Ca suffit !
Je pars vers de nouveaux pays
Kinaï : Arrête ! Chuuut ! Koda arrête de chanter !
Où le ciel est bleu, dites que je m'en vais
Et c'est tout ce qui compte dans ma vie
Kinaï : Oh...

Phil Colins : Dites à mes amis que je m'en vais
Et j'aime chacun des pas que je fais
Le soleil est mon guide et moi je m'en vais
Je ne peux m'empêcher de sourire

Car il n'y a rien de mieux que de se revoir
Peu importe ce qui nous sépare
(Koda parle : Alors j'ai vu ******)
(Animaux : Ah ah ah !!)
Vous ne pouvez que sourire de nos histoires
Oh ça me fait chaud au cœur
(Koda : Ah ah ah !! Ouais ! Ya !)

Alors dites leur que je m'en vais
Je pars vers de nouveaux amis
(Kinaï : Atchouu !)
Et dormir sous les étoiles c'est mon idéal
Sous la lune qui protège mes nuits

Ni la neige ni la pluie chang'ront ma vie
Le soleil se lèvera c'est écrit
Le vent qui frotte mon visage réchauffe mon cœur
Je pars vers un avenir meilleur
(Kinaï : Ooh... Ooooooh !)

Glacier...
Much : Et les traces là ! Tu crois qu'il va pas les suivre

Koda : Oh ! Ca fait drôle ! C'est bizarre !
Eléphant : Triii !
Truc : Pousses-toi, c'est moi qui conduit !
Much : Ouais mais après ça sera mon tour de conduire !
Truc : Ah bah c'est pas aussi facile que ça en a l'air !
T'as intérêt à bien regarder comment je fais là !
Much : C'est toujours toi qui commence, c'est toujours toi
Qui conduit, alors moi j'en ai marre ! Marre !
Truc : Ooh pfff...

Dites à mes amis que je m'en vais

Je suis impatient d'arriver
(Animaux : Ah ah ah ah !...)
Et le ciel toujours bleu

J'ai du bon temps à partager

Dites à mes amis que je m'en vais
Je suis impatient de rentrer
(Eléphant : Triii !)
(Koda : Hooo !)
Sous le soleil qui descend
Oui je m'en vais
C'est le bonheur à partager
Oui je m'en vais

Koda chante : C'est vrai je m'en vais
Much parle : Quelle ambiance !



[Verse 1]
D'you see the face on the TV screen
Coming at you every Sunday?
See the face on the billboard?
Well that man is me
On the cover of a magazine
There's no question why I'm smiling
You buy a piece of paradise, you buy a piece of me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll get you everything you wanted
I'll get you everything you need
You don't need to believe in hereafter
Just believe in me

[Chorus]
Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything is alright

[Verse 2]
I believe in the family
With my ever-loving wife beside me
But she don't know about my girlfriend
Or the man I met last night
Do you believe in God?
Cause that is what I'm selling
And if you wanna get to heaven
Well, I'll see you right

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't even have to leave your house
Or get out of your chair
You don't even have to touch that dial
Cause I'm everywhere

I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Won't find me practicing what I'm preaching
Won't find me making no sacrifice
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
If you promise to be good, try to be nice
God will take good care of you
Well, just do as I say, don't do as I do

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm counting my blessings
As I've found true happiness
Cause I'm a-getting richer
Day by day
You can find me in the phone book
Just call my toll-free number
You can do it any way you want
Just do it right away

[Pre-Chorus]
And there'll be no doubt in your mind
You'll believe everything I'm saying
If you wanna get closer to Him
Get on your knees and start paying

[Chorus/Outro]
Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Jesus, he knows, he knows
Ooh, yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Jesus, he knows, he knows
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

[Intro - Speech]
It was on a divine visitation, that the Lord told me that I was to go on the television. I was lying on the bed and the bed began to go around, and I had the sensation like I was on a merry-go-round. And then the furniture joined in and then I was in the stars! There were stars everywhere; above me, below me, to the left of me, to the right of me. Millions and millions of stars and the Lord said ‘the stars are the souls that you will win for me.’

The Lord actually talks to me, you know, I hear what’s being said, and he said to me ‘Get me $18 million by the weekend’, and the Angel of the Lord stands by my side and speaks into my ear and it’s a beautiful thing and I hear what’s being said. It’s a marvellous, marvellous experience; I never thought such a thing could happen – in the name of Jesus!

And the Lord spoke to me: he said ‘Stretch forth your hands, TELL the people to put their hands against yours, and I will heal them. Get me $18 million by the weekend. TOUCH THE SCREEN, TOUCH THE SCREEN!’

[Verse 1]
D'you see the face on the TV screen
Coming at you every Sunday?
See the face on the billboard?
Well that man is me
On the cover of a magazine
There's no question why I'm smiling
You buy a piece of paradise, you buy a piece of me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll get you everything you wanted
I'll get you everything you need
You don't need to believe in hereafter
Just believe in me

[Chorus]
Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything is alright

[Verse 2]
I believe in the family
With my ever-loving wife beside me
But she don't know about my girlfriend
Or the man I met last night
Do you believe in God?
Cause that is what I'm selling
And if you wanna get to heaven
Well, I'll see you right

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't even have to leave your house
Or get out of your chair
You don't even have to touch that dial
Cause I'm everywhere

[Chorus]
Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

[Speech]
God’s everywhere; he just uses me as his instrument. He speaks, the power goes through my voice: the sign of the cross. Jesus told me that

[Bridge]
Won't find me practicing what I'm preaching
Won't find me making no sacrifice
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
If you promise to be good, try to be nice
God will take good care of you
Well, just do as I say, don't do as I do

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm counting my blessings
As I've found true happiness
Cause I'm a-getting richer
Day by day

Just do it right away

[Pre-Chorus]
And there'll be no doubt in your mind
You'll believe everything I'm saying
If you wanna get closer to Him
Get on your knees and start praying

[Chorus/Outro]
Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Jesus, he knows, he knows
Ooh, yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Jesus, he knows, he knows
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

[Outro - Speech]
One day I was standing here in front of the cameras, right here in the cathedral, and the Lord spoke to me. He said ‘STRETCH FORTH YOUR HANDS AND TELL THE PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR HANDS AGAINST YOURS, AND I WILL HEAL THEM!’
He said this was a form of laying on of hands; so put your hands on the screens now. TOUCH THE SCREEN, TOUCH THE SCREEN! HEAL, HEAL, HEAL IN THE NAME OF JESUS, HEAL, TOUCH THE SCREEN, TOUCH THE SCREEN--



Tout ce que tu fais, je le ferai
Apprends-moi ce que je n' connais pas!
Tout ce que tu sais n'est rien encore pour moi

Il y a tant de choses à savoir
Semblant si près, pourtant si loin
Je me vois comm' les autres me voient
Mais il y a quelque chose plus grand là-bas...

Je veux savoir, montre-les-moi
Ces étrangers qui seraient faits comme moi
Apprends-moi, montre-les-moi
Ces inconnus qui seraient pareils à moi

Tout ces mouv'ments, tous les gestes qu'elle fait
Me font des frissons dans le corps
Pourquoi je sens ce besoin d'être toujours près d'elle?

Toutes ces émotions nouvelles
D'un monde nouveau loin, très loin d'ici
Au-delà des arbres et des nuages
Je vois devant moi un autre horizon

Je veux savoir, montre-les-moi
Ces étrangers qui seraient faits comme moi
Apprends-moi, montre-les-moi
Ces inconnus qui seraient pareils à moi

Viens voir ce monde qui est le mien
Il est plus beau que dans tes rêves
Ressens-tu ce que mon coeur ressent pour toi?
Prends ma main, vers ce monde que je veux voir

Je veux savoir, montre-les-moi
Ces étrangers qui seraient faits comme moi
Apprends-moi, montre-les-moi
Ces inconnus qui seraient pareils à moi
Je veux savoir!



[Verse 1]
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back?[X2]
My arms are missing you, my lips feel the same way too
I tried so hard to be true, like I promised I'd do
But this boy keeps coming around, he's trying to wear my resistance down

[Chorus]
Hey Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back
He calls me on the phone, about three times a day
Now my heart's just listening to what he has to say
But this loneliness that I have within keeps reaching out to be his friend

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Need your loving, need your loving

[Instrumental break: Verse 2]
I want to say, I'm not getting any stronger, I can't hold out very much longer
Trying hard to be true, but Jimmy, he talks just as sweet as you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Need your loving, need your loving[X2]
(Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back)

[Repeats out]



Somewhere on the waterfront
Johnny's hiding with a gun
Swears he'll kill any man that tells his story
He ain't sorry for what he's done

He broke into a drugstore
Just to cure a daily need
He didn't mean to shoot the guard
But he was blinded by the greed

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny

You see that nun, she's his sister
She doesn't know that he's gone bad
When they told it to his father
It drove the old man mad

Just like his mother warned him
From her dying bed
It's all right to lose your heart
But never lose your head

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Look out

Now the cops have got him surrounded
And he doesn't stand a hope
He wonders how he could be in so much trouble
Over just a little dope

Five to one he gets away
That's the odds I'm going to give
Five to four they blast him away
Three to one he's going to live

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, you better run
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny

Back in the alley where he was slain
I thought I heard something move
Beside the trash can lay a heart and chain
The picture had been removed

Just another junkyard juicer
Looking for a bed
It's all right to lose your heart
But never lose your head

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Look out



It's no use saying that it's alright, it's alright
But where were you after midnight, midnight
Heard a Bang, Bang, Bang; Down they go
It's just a job you do
Cos the harder they run, and the harder they fall
I'm coming down hard on you

Now no-one saw what you looked like, what you looked like
Like a stranger you came out of the night, out of the night
Cos someone put the word on you, and I hope my aim is true

Cos I got a name, and I got a number, I gotta line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I'm coming after you

Don't keep saying that it's alright, it's alright
It seems you went just a little too far this time
Heard a Bang Bang Bang, and down you go
It's just a job I do
Cos the harder you run the harder you fall
I'm coming down hard on you, hard on you - I hope my aim is true

I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, and I'm coming after you

Keep running, Keep running; city to city
Even if you're innocent
You can cause too much embarrassment
And though your heart is breaking
And you know there's no mistaking
Cos you feel your life line breaking (keep running, keep running)
You can feel your hands are shaking (keep running, keep running)
And no-one answers the telephone
You can never never ever go home alone
And though your heart is aching
And you know there's no mistaking
The footsteps close behind

Now don't pretend that you sleep at night, but sleep tight
And can't you feel that the time is right, it's alright
Heard a Bang Bang Bang, and down you go
Oh no-one really cares
Cos the harder you run, and the harder you fall
I'm coming down hard on you, hard on you - I'm hoping that my aim is true

I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I'm coming after you

I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I got a job to do



[Verse 1]
Father comes home 'cos his money's run out
Seems a little loose tonight, he starts to shout
Dinner's not on the table, seems mother's not able
She's staring at the TV
You can smell it on his breath, feel it in his touch
He never meant to hit her hard, but he's like that when he's had too much

[Chorus]
It's just another story about going too far[x2]

[Verse 2]
Well the kid's at school, she's getting good grades
But the peer pressure's starting now - too bad, she had it made
Seems there's always someone trying to push you to do something, you know, ain't the way they told you to
It's hard to see
The things you taught her, how to be, it's like you told her nothing, selective memory
Come on just try it, it's just a smoke, ain't gonna kill you, so she takes a toke
Fade to grey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well the guys at work seemed OK, they'd buy you a drink, get you laid, what's wrong with that?
Why'd they have more money than you, expensive cars, expensive clothes, d'you ever think of what they do?
At night they're out, shaking people down, when they're walking together seems they own the town
But hey, who's gonna talk, you are their alibi, don't turn around, don't ask questions, just walk

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Just like a prisoner
He do not know right from wrong
Just like a baby
He sings a pleading song

[Chorus]
And that is why
So many tears must fall
Yes, that is why
So many tears must fall

[Verse 2]
Just like a sailor
He steers away from home
He feels a tidal wave
In his heart, but he is not alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I am like that prisoner
I do not know right from wrong
Just like that baby
I sing a pleading song

[Outro]
And that is why
You will never know how I feel
Yes, that is why
You will never know how I feel



Found that man reported missing
He wandered in his home
It don't seem to bad if you consider
Just what he's been through
It seems he met up with a gang of thieves
Who mistook him for a man of means
They locked him up, then found he had no money
And so they let him go again
Now he's back at home and happy
Just to see the kids

I wish that I could really tell you
All the things that happen to me
And all that I have seen:
A world full of people, their hearts full of joy
Cities of light with no fear of war
And thousands of creatures with happier lives
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to hide

Oh, keep it dark

It seems strange to have to lie
About a world so bright
Tell instead a made-up story
From the world of night

I wish that I could really tell you
All the things that happen to me
And all that I have seen:
A world full of people, their hearts full of joy
Cities of light with no fear of war
And thousands of creatures with happier lives
And dreams of a future with meaning and no neeed to lie
No need to hate, no need to hide

Oh, keep it dark



[Verse 1]
Essen, Essen, Essen
Immer noch so hungrig
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf

[Verse 2]
Schlafen, Schlafen, Schlafen
Nachts immer so nervös
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Nein, hör nie wieder auf

[Verse 3]
Schnell ans Telefon
Egal welche Nummer
Jede Stimme ist mir recht
Zu weit diesmal
Viel zu weit hab ich's getrieben
Der Kopf platzt, mir ist schlecht
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf

[Bridge]
Hinter jedem Stuhl
Steckt ein Schweigen, das lebt
Es kommt hervor, wenn der Nebel sich hebt
Es frisst alles - alarm!
Lichter gehn aus, Sterne stürzen ab
Wie ein Bienenschwarm

[Refrain]
Keine Selbst-
Keine Selbstkontrolle
Keine Selbst-
Keine Selbst-
Keine Selbstkontrolle
Keine Selbst-
Keine Selbstkontrolle
Keine Selbst-
Keine Selbstkontrolle
Keine Selbst-
Keine, keine

[Verse 4]
Reden, Reden, Reden
Ich tu dir nicht gern weh
Ich hör nicht wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf

[Verse 5]
Regen in der Strasse
Regen in der Nacht
Ich muss jetzt weitergehn
Ich muss jetzt weitergehn
Nein, ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Nein, ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf
Ich hör nie wieder auf



Immer tu ich einem andren weh
Und ich kann es nicht mehr ändern
Es ist schon zu spät
Ich tat alles, was ich konnte, ja!
Ich habe mich so bemüht
Und ich frage mich, wohin der Weg mich führt

Bruder Bär, du bist verletzt
Hast mir geglaubt, mir blind vertraut
Doch du bist verletzt
Das, was ich dir so lang verschwieg
Tut mir unendlich Leid
Und ich hoffe nur, dass jemand dich von
Deinem Schmerz befreit

Kein Weg führt aus der Dunkelheit
Keine Zukunft
Ich kann mich nicht befrei´n
Und alles ist so hoffnungslos
Alles scheint mir hoffnungslos



[Verse 1]
I do not want to lose this good thing that I have got
If I do, I would surely, surely lose a lot
Because your love is better than any love I know

[Chorus]
It is like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
Think I would better knock on wood, baby

[Verse 2]
I am not superstitious about you, I can't take no chance
You got me spinning, baby. Baby, I am in a trance
Because your love is better than any love I know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There is no secret, that woman is my loving cup
She sees to it that I get it up
Just one touch from her, you know can do so much

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood



[Verse 1]
I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger has gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night
There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

[Verse 2]
Oh, superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, these men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go around
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

[Verse 3]
I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright all through the night
In the wake of this madness, as I held you tight
So long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep
There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to



[Verse 1]
I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger has gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night
There's too many men, too many people

They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people

The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

[Bridge]
I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago...

[Verse 3]
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

[Chorus/Outro]
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given

[Koda]
O pé na estrada eu vou botar
Que já tá na hora de ir
Um lindo horizonte e um céu azul
O que mais eu poderia pedir?

[Solista]
O pé na estrada eu vou botar
E o coração eu quero abrir
Sob os raios do sol sigo um sonho meu
Eu não posso deixar de sorrir

Nada é melhor do que amigos rever
Ainda que demore a chegar
As estórias vão fazer você sorrir
Vão fazer você sonhar

Que todos saibam: lá vou eu
Por novos caminhos seguir
Com a luz lá no céu a olhar pra mim
Eu vou sob as estrelas dormir

E se a chuva cair, não vou parar
Qualquer tempestade tem fim
E o vento no meu rosto a soprar me faz sonhar
O que eu quero é caminhar assim
Pois eu vou seguindo
Meu caminho
Eu vou seguindo

Eu vou seguindo
Eu vou seguindo
Eu vou seguindo

Que todos saibam que lá vou eu
(Que todos saibam que lá vou eu)
E o que eu mais quero é chegar
(E o que eu mais quero é chegar)
Um lindo horizonte e um céu azul
Estórias eu quero contar
(Eu quero contar)

Mas, que todos saibam que lá vou eu
(Que todos saibam que lá vou eu)
Caminhando eu vou pro meu lar
(Caminhando eu vou pro meu lar)
Sob os raios do sol, sigo um sonho meu
(Sonho meu)
Estórias eu quero contar
(Quero contar, portando lá vou eu!)
Sim, lá vou eu!

[Koda]
Sim, lá vou eu!



[Verse 1]
My mom and daddy both say
I must be crazy to be this infatuated
But I know you know
We got something special never felt before
You get me going just looking at you
And the feeling's not hard to recognise so
Alright I'll come out in the open with it
Will you walk out with me

[Chorus 1]
Because you're the first girl I've ever loved
Tell me do you feel the same way
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest
Because I know who I am
Your skin is smooth as silk and your eyes like stars
You're just like a picture book standing there
But I can't go on
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way that I do

[Chorus 2]
I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china
Because I know it's your first time

[Verse 2]
Your mum and dad don't like me
And they tell me every time I call around to see you
I don't know why
Because I always straighten my tie and comb my hair
I know your brother thinks that
I'm a limp wristed wimp from the other side of town
I know he's got me wrong
Because I'm really not like that, I'll tell you why

[Chorus 3]
You're the first girl I've ever loved
Tell me do you feel the same way
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest
'Cause I know who I am
I remember the very first time I held your hand
And that was the last time you were so close to me
But I can't go on
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way as I do

[Chorus 2]
I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china
Because I know it's your first time

[Outro]
I know you know and now I want to, I want to tell everybody
I know you know and now I want them all to see (x2)



JANE
This man is not like other men
Like no man I've ever seen
You'll have to meet him to believe it
I know just how you'll be
Oh he defies all gravity

PROFESSOR PORTER
Oh, Jane can this be true

JANE
Like no man I've ever seen

PROFESSOR PORTER
My word

JANE
He seems to fly
Defying everything

PROFESSOR PORTER
No

JANE
Like something in your dreams

PROFESSOR PORTER
Good Heavens!

JANE/ PROFESSOR PORTER
Can this be true?

PROFESSOR PORTER
This man he sounds extraordinary!

JANE
He is father!

PROFESSOR PORTER
I'd love to meet him too

JANE
You shall...

PROFESSOR PORTER
Well does he talk?
Like you or I can?

JANE
Well...

PROFESSOR PORTER
And what do you two do?

JANE
I know this, he seems at one with nature

PROFESSOR PORTER
That?s good

JANE
Like no man I ever seen

PROFESSOR PORTER
Hmm, he sound quiet nice

JANE
It seems he learned from all around him
They're like his friends you see

PROFESSOR PORTER
Really?!

JANE / PROFESSOR PORTER
Can this be true?

JANE
Oh father, sometimes I wake at night
And see him there
He lightens up the darkness you will see

PROFESSOR PORTER
Oh I can see...
Oh daughter what?s this I hear?
It seems he fills your heart with joy
I see the symptoms in those eyes
I feel so happy, and proud of you inside...
So we both made our discoveries

JANE
Yes!

PROFESSOR PORTER
Though, I'll keep mine to myself

JANE
I?m not following you daddy

PROFESSOR PORTER
But if my instincts serve correctly
I may have lost my girl

JANE
Oh no no no no no!

JANE/PROFESSOR PORTER
Oh this is what we've waited for
We always knew one day
This is the link we've both been searching for
It's just a breath away
Can this be true?
Can this be true?
We'll see!



The chamber was in confusion
All the voices shouting loud
I could only just hear a voice quite near say
"Please help me through the crowd"

Said if I helped her through she could help me too
But I could see that she was wholly blind
From her pale face and her pale skin
A moonlight shined

Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

When I'd led her through the people
The angry noise began to grow
She said, "Let me feel the way the breezes blow
And I'll show you where to go"

So I followed her into a big round cave
She said, "They're coming for you, now don't be afraid"
Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne
Carved in jade

Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

She leaves me in my darkness
I have to face, face my fear
And the darkness closes in on me
I can hear a whirring sound growing near

I can see the corner of the tunnel
Lit up by whatever's coming here
Two golden globes float into the room
And a blaze of white light fills the air



Kelis - Little Suzie
[Verse]
Got credit cards in my pockets
But I walk past bums all day
(Why why why)
I see dealers pushing poisons
But I have nothing to say
(Why why why)
I date two people at the same time
Knowing it is twice the sin
(Why why why)
Oh yes I have this little problem here I'm being vain again
(Why why)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man I'm just listening to His teachings my soul and heart
This is God's movie and I'm just trying to play my part
Time is running out and we've broken the seventh seal
The more I read I realize that UFOs are real

[Chorus]
Hey little Suzie
You don't have to cry no more
Hey little Bobby
Don't you worry about the war
Hey little Jessica
You just keep up with the score
Cuz God closes the windows
Next thing you know He opens doors

[Verse]
I blew my paycheck getting real high today
(Why why why)
I lied and told my nephew that I had no more time to play
(Why why why)
I saw this lady gettin robbed I looked away
(Why why why)
I put my grandma in a home and made her stay
(Why why)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
Singing la la la la la
Singing la la la la la

[Verse]
I give in church
But you are asking me where it really goes
(Why why why)
I could give more but I end up spending it on shoes and clothes
(Why why why)
I chew ice, look at my watch some Middle Eastern babies sold
(Why why why)
In the winter I have furs knowing some poor child is cold
(Why why)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What if the holy trinity was Christians, Muslims, Jews
Yet we bomb eachother for more coverage on the news
He was this he wasn't that he never touched the girl either way
Our messiah shall save the world

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
Kelis - Star Wars
[Verse]
I was the first new born babe
Brought to you by the fearsome ‘Tunes
Here comes the nerds
Look in the sky
It’s the Clipse, and Nigo’s flying real high too
They’ll be here soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Now Star Trak is here
We’ve come to save the day
When Star Trak has appeared
We’re going to pave the way

[Chorus (x3)]
This is a new beginning
The empire strikes back
Learn from losing
Cherish winning
Forever Star Trak
Kelis - I Don't Care Anymore
[Verse]
Well you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace
Or drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore, I don't care
You can tell everybody bout the state I'm in
And you won't catch me crying cos I just can't win
I don't care anymore, I don't care, I don't care anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't care what you say (I don't care what you say)
I don't play the same games you play

[Chorus 1]
Cos I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's means to an end
They don't care anymore (they don't care)
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time
I've got my favorite music, I speak my mind
I don't care anymore, I will always be alright
I don't care no more, I don't care

[Bridge 1]
I don't care what you say (I don't care what you say)
We never played by the same rules anyway (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I won't be there anymore, get out of my way
Let me by, let me by, I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore, I don't care, oh, I don't care anymore
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care anymore

[Pre-Chorus 2 - Pharrell & Kelis]
Well I don't care now what you say
I don't care what you say
Cos everyday (everyday), I'm feeling fine with my self
I'm feeling fine with myself (I feel fine by myself)
And I don't care what you say (I don't care what you say)
I don't care what you say, hey
I'll do alright by myself (I'll be alright by myself, yeah)

[Bridge 2]
I don't care (I don't care), Anymore (anymore)
I don't care (I don't care), Anymore (anymore)
I don't care (I don't care), Anymore (anymore)
I don't care, Anymore

[Bridge 3]
Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what
Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what
Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what
Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what

[Chorus 2]
Cos I remember all the times I tried so hard
And you laughed in my face cos you held all the cards
I don't care anymore, I don't care
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
Cos all I want of you is just let me be
I don't care anymore
Did you hear I don't care anymore, did you hear

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I don't care, I don't care, what you say, what you say
I never did believe you much anyway
We won't be there anymore, we won't be there
So get out of our way, get out of my way
Let us by, we've got better things to do with our time

[Chorus 3]
We don't care anymore, we don't care anymore
We don't care anymore, we don't care anymore
We don't care, we don't care
We don't care anymore, we don't care



I'm feeling so confused today
It seems they've changed the rules again
Cos in my life I'm trying hard
To do it all so I can remain
Healthy and sane

I'll live forever
Always one more tomorrow
Living forever
Always one more tomorrow

I heard it on the radio
Too much of what they said wasn't so
And now we've got to do those things
That they brought before were so wrong
To be healthy and strong

And live forever
Always one more tomorrow
Living forever
Always one more tomorrow

I know we don't need you
I know we don't believe you
You don't really have the answer
You think you know better
You think it really matters
You just want to rule over everybody's lives

I think I'll change my life today
Gone are the times of taking care
And I don't need a reason why
All I need is all in a day survive in a way

Or just till tomorrow
Always one more tomorrow
Living forever
Do you really want to live forever



Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long

Yes
You'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Feel the pressure
Your back's against the wall

Love is gaining on you
You're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love
Afraid to take a chance

You better hide your feelings
Get out while you can

Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
The magic down there is so strong

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town

Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
The magic down there is so strong

You'll be pulling out your hair
Drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been

You'll be haunted by her face
Missing her warm embrace

Memories of loving her
Holding her tight every night
Was that the best part of your life ?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please
Please don't go
Don't go
No!
Don't go!
Don't go!

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm
Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts
All over town, All over town

Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
(Going loco down in Acapulco)
(Going loco down in Acapulco)



Lo que hagas tú hoy, lo haré
También Dime cómo es y
Aprenderé Es razonable mas no para
Mí Sé que hay tanto por aprender
Parece claro mas no es verdad Y puedo ver mi
Propia imagen Descubriré cuan grande es mi
Futuro

Quiero saber, que me enseñes Quiero saber
Lo extraño que soy Dime más que
Entienda Lo que es normal en lo extraño que
Soy

Cada gesto, como mueve su ser
Siento un algo como
Nunca sentí Esta atracción me invita
A estar muy junto a ella Las emociones que hoy
Conocí De un mundo son que jamás
Viví Detrás del sol, detrás
Del mar ¿Qué habrá de nuevo
En el horizonte?

Quiero saber, que me enseñes Quiero saber
Lo extraño que soy Dime más que
Entienda Lo que es normal en lo extraño que
Soy

Ven conmigo, te mostraré Que en mi mundo
Esto es realidad Y a sentir lo que siento yo
Contigo aquí Sígueme Con mi mano te
Guiaré

Quiero saber, que me enseñes Quiero saber
Lo extraño que soy Dime más que
Entienda Lo que es normal en lo extraño que
Soy Quiero saber



[Chorus]
While I sit here trying to think of things to say
Someone lies bleeding in a field somewhere
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go
I've seen all I wanna see today

[Chorus]
While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
And it would seem that we've got a long long way to go
But I can't take it anymore

[Chorus 2]
Turn it off if you want to
Switch it off it will go away
Turn it off if you want to
Switch it off or look away

[Chorus]
While I sit and we talk and talk and we talk some more
Someone's loved one's heart stops beating in a street somewhere
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go, I know
I've heard all I wanna hear today

[Chorus 2]
Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)
Switch it off it will go away (switch it off it will go away)
Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)
Switch it off or look away (switch it off or look away)

[Outro]
Switch it off
Turn it off



[Verse 1]
There are things in life you learn
And, oh, in time you'll see
It's out there somewhere
It's all waiting
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there
Watching over you

[Chorus]
Just take a look through my eyes
There's a better place somewhere out there
Ooo, just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(There's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

[Verse 2]
There will be times on this journey
All you'll see is darkness
But out there somewhere
Daylight finds you
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there
Watching over you

[Chorus]
Just take a look through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
Theres better place somewhere out there
Ooo, just take a look through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(There's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

[Bridge]
All the things that you can change
There's a meaning in everything
And you will find all you need
There's so much to understand

[Chorus]
Take a look (take a look) through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look (take a look) through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(You'll be amazed if you just take a look)
Just take a look through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look (take a look) through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(You'll find a better place)
If you look through my eyes
(You know there's a better place)
Just take a look through my eyes
(You know there's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

Take a look through my eyes



Ooh woah oh
Ooh woah oh
Ooh woah oh

There are things in life you'll learn
And oh, in time you'll see
Cause out there somewhere
It's all waiting
If you keep believing

So don't run, don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see, trust me
I'll be there watching over you

Just take a look through my eyes
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
If you look through my eyes

There will be times on this journey
All you'll see is darkness
Out there somewhere daylight finds you
If you keep believing

So don't run, don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see, trust me
I'll be there
I'll be watching over you

Just take a look through my eyes
(take a look through my eyes)
There's a better place somewhere out there
(better place somewhere out there)
Just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
If you take a look through my eyes

All the things that you can change
There's a meaning in everything
And you will find all you need
There's so much to understand

Just take a look through my eyes
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find, yeah
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woahhhhh
(if you take a look through my eyes)
Be amazed what you'll find
(be amazed what you'll find)
If you look through my eyes



[Verse 1]
There are things in life you learn
And oh in time you'll see
It's out there somewhere
It's all waiting
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there watching over you

[Chorus]
Just take a look through my eyes
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(There's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

[Verse 2]
There will be times on this journey
All you'll see is darkness
But out there somewhere
Daylight finds you
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there watching over you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All the things that you can change
There's a meaning in everything
And you will find all you need
There's so much to understand
Take a look (take a look) through my eyes
There's a better place somewhere out there

[Chorus][x3]



[Verse 1]
Once upon a time I made a lion roar
He was sleeping in the sunbeams on the old zoo floor
I had gone to see the park where my papa used to play
It's called called Villa Borghese and it's on the way

[Chorus]
Back to To east Africa[x4]

[Verse 2]
Down on Grand Comoro Island, where I grew past four
I could swim and fish and snorkel on the ocean floor
And the wind laughed, and the wind laughed through the trees as if to say
Here's a child who'll want the world to go his way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Suddenly for me the world turned upside down
Far from my friends the lions and the dolphins came this awful sound
Dark shadows, sounds of thunder raging over me
Came this monster called 'A-dre-no-leu-ko-dys-tro-phy

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well they said, they said, they said (the ones who know it all)
They said from now on for you there will be no more standing tall
So I took my parents hands, I lifted my head to say
I'll just have to be a hero, there's no other way!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I am going back to east Africa[x2]
Come with me I am going back[x3]
Well I think I am going back[?]
COme with me to east Africa



There's an angel standing in the sun

There's an angel standing in the sun
Free to get back home



[Chorus]
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now, now you're gone

[Verse 1]
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there

[Verse 2]
You closed the door to your heart
And you turned the key, locked your love away from me

Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone

[Verse 3]
You made me love you
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love
Came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now

[Verse 4]
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left it's trace

After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

[Bridge]
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
You made me love you
Oh, my darling
Now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh, my darling
Now you're gone



[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm with her
Something inside
Starts to burning
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

[Chorus]
Just like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart

[Verse 2]
Whenever she calls my name
So slow, sweet and plain
I feel, I feel, feel that burning flame
Has my blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

[Chorus]
Just like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart

(heatwave)
(heatwave)

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Well, that funny feeling has me amazed
I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze

Just like a heatwave
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh, he's in love girl (ooooh)
Yeah, he's in love girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, go ahead, girl
Ooh, you know he's in love, girl
Don't pass up this chance
It could be true romance

[Outro]
Heatwave
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(wahooo, wahooo)
Oooh, heatwave
Yeah, yeah
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo) Yeah, yeah
(Burnin' burnin' burnin') [?]
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo) Heatwave, yeah, heatwave
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo)
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')
Heatwave, yeah, heatwave
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo)
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo)
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')



[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I lie awake, wondering if I'll make it out of here
But the wind blows round my heels, so I stay
I remember lying there, wishing I could be someone else
Trying to find somehow to get away

[Chorus 2]
If I asked him nicely d'you think he's show me how to fly
'cos the dust has weighed my wings down, and I'm too tired to try

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I sit here hearing voices in my head
I try to understand, to make some sense
I wonder if I had to, would I lie to save myself?
A plea of guilty, but self defence

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Try, all of my sins
'cos I can't stop now
Just don't leave me behind

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]



[Verse 1]
I remember yet before we met
When every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely one
And I remember meeting you
Discovering love could be so true
When shared by two, instead of only one
When you said you loved me
We could not be parted
Said, I built my world around you
And I'm truly glad I found you

[Chorus]
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I never felt so good before
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Yes it has, you know it has

[Verse 2]
Each night I pray we'll never part
Because the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day
Best I try, hard I try
To reassure and satisfy
You know I'd be lost if you went away

[Chorus]
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Yes it has, I know it has
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever

[Outro]
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I never felt so good before
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Yes it has, you know it has
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Don't you know my baby there
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever



[Verse 1: Phil Collins]
Was it summer when the river ran dry
Or was it just another dam
When the evil of a snowflake in June
Could still be a source of relief
O how I love you, I once cried long ago
But I was the one who decided to go
To search beyond the final crest
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high

So I pretended to have wings for my arms
And took off in the air
I flew to places which the clouds never see
Too close to the deserts of sand
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies
Forced me to land and take a disguise
I would welcome a horses kick to send me back
If I could find a horse not made of sand

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
If this deserts all there'll ever be
Then tell me what becomes of me
A fall of rain
That must have been another of your dreams
A dream of mad man moon

[Instrumental until 4:49]

[Verse 2: Phil Collins]
Hey man
I'm the sand man
And boy have I news for you;
They're gonna throw you in jail
And you know they can't fail
Cos sand is thicker than blood
But a prison in sand
Is a haven in hell
For a jail can give you a goal
[and a] goal can find you a role
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle
Where it rains so much
You can't wait for a touch
Of sun and sand, sun and sand...

[Verse 3: Phil Collins]
Within the valley of shadow-less death
They pray for thunderclouds and rain
But to the multitude who stand in the rain
Heaven is where the sun shines
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down
Forever caught in desert lands
One has to learn to disbelieve the sea

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
If this deserts all there'll ever be
Then tell me what becomes of me
A fall of rain?
That must have been another of your dreams
A dream of mad man moon

This is from the self-titled album recording sessions where "Mama" was still being made. The lyrics will stay like this unless someone has the time to transcribe what Phil Collins is saying in recording



See the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for something to show

And nobody knows him, and nobody cares
'Cause there's no hidin' place
There's no hidin' place
For you

Lookin' everywhere at no one
He sees everything and nothing at all, oh
When he shouts, nobody listens
Where he leads, no one will go, oh

He's a lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for something to show

And nobody knows him, and nobody cares
'Cause there's no hidin' place
There's no hidin' place
For you and me

Are we just like all the rest?
We're lookin' too hard for somethin' he's got
Or movin' too fast to rest
But like a monkey on your back, you need it
But do you love it enough to leave it all?

Just like the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show

Who the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he's there every day now
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show

Who the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show



There's the Reds and there's the Greens
Super slicks and has beens
They're accompanied by three men dressed in black
One's a whistle, two are flags, quite often they're the drags
Kick the ball into the goal, they put it back

Yes Match of the Day's
The only way, to spend your Saturday

Each side's eleven men, with numbers on their backs
But at a distance they all tend to look the same
But some own their boutiques, they clean up every week
Inciting riots, causing chaos, such a shame!

But Match of the Day's
The only way
We spend our Saturday

And that's not all, our mates the keepers
Slippin' and sliding in the mud
Arms as long as creepers

Send him off Ref'***!!++??
Where are your specs Ref'+++***!!!
Kick you to death Ref'!!XX**??
Oi! Are you deaf Ref'X*+X*!!?

There's a few things before we go
That I think you ought to know
Obstruction, Body Checking, heavy tackles
So put on your hat and scarf
Have a drink, have a larf'
>From the terrace you can see your men do battle

Yes Match of the Day's
The only way
You can spend your Saturday

Don't forget, the trainers with their sponges
Managers with open cheques, liquid business lunches
Send 'im off Ref'***!!++??
Where are your specs Ref'!***&&&!!!
Kick you to death Ref'!!XX**??
Oi! Are you deaf Ref'X&+X&+!!?



The fires are burning in another land
Don't start counting, don't start counting
Colder and colder, the ice is moving closer
And it gets me down
Going round and round and down the same old track
Pack on my back
Going swiftly nowhere, heart in my ear
Beating like a drum

Where will you go?
All by yourself
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, hah)

And now I'm standing on the corner, waiting in the rain
But then in sunlight without warnin', I invent a name

Me and Sarah Jane, we had a special thing goin'
Me and Sarah Jane
It was a time of love and laughter. It wouldn't come again
We had our round of joyful laughter. Then began the pain

Me and Sarah Jane, we had a special thing goin'
Me and Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)

I'm searching for a clue, traces on the sand

First, I'm flying, going round, round, round
Then, I'm sliding, going down, down, down
Doesn't matter - where I start, I always end up
Crawling through those same old crowded rooms

Me and Sarah Jane, we had it coming, all the pain
Walkin' down the streets and finding nothing is the same
And now the city lights are dimmin' one by one
It costs too much money to keep them on

Me and Sarah Jane, in silence walk along the shore
Tears of joy and mocking laughter, words lost in the wind
The tide was risin' but there we stayed
We had no fear of dying, we weren't afraid



Ma would never say what happened
And we knew better than push too hard
We knew we had all the chores to tend to
Like fixing fences and helping her
Washing dishes and making coffee
Me and Virgil'd chop some wood
But we'd stop our swinging
Just to listen to her crying
It didn't sound too good
I can remember, too well

But we never thought to pay much heed
We learned to live life the best we could
But then one day pa upped and left us
High and dry without a word
Seemed a pity
My ma was pretty
But I soon learned life ain't that way
And I can remember hearing her weeping
While we were sleeping next to her

I can remember
I'll never forgive and I'll never forget
Cos pa you broke her heart
Ooh pa you broke her heart
You broke her heart
Ooh pa you broke her heart

Well the years rolled by
And 'fore we knew it
Our sister got married and moved out west
I stayed with ma, cos I couldn't desert her
I knew it would hurt her to be alone
So we pulled tighter
We said we'd try to make things easy
And raise a smile
But as the night came
We'd hear her crying
Praying for pa to come back again

I can remember
I'll never forgive him and I'll never forget
Cos pa you broke her heart
Oh pa you broke her heart

And then the winter came
I'd never known it colder
Ooh it seemed the worst for years
And the night she died I swear I saw her smiling
Saying I was a big boy now, no tears

So I packed up all we had, and Virgil got the horses
And we paid our last respects and gave the whip a crack
Ooh, seemed a big bad world, we were riding into
Me and Virgil both agreed, we best head off
And don't look back

Nothing but desert all around
Oh it made me wonder
Lord it's hard to carry on
When you're sick with hunger

Weeks and months of sleeping rough
Keeping clear of danger
Seems we were miles from anywhere
And too far gone to change it
We'd best keep going, don't look back

Well me and Virgil we beat the desert
Riding fast and riding hard
We hit the city, the past behind us
So we raised some hell, we had some fun
But real soon I met a lady oh so pretty, and oh so fine
'fore too long I found myself married
With a home of my own and a blue eyed son
And 'til this day I can hear ma saying to me -
"You're a big boy now"



[Vers 1]
Åh, din kræft vil gør' dig stærk
Din forstand vil gør' dig klog
Du vil gøre store ting en dag
Du er ude på en rejse
Mange spørgsmål dukker op
Men du klatrer op af bjerget
Og når den høje top

[Omkvæd]
Menneskesøn se himlens skær
La' din ånd slå vingeslag
Snart ved du, hva' du er værd
Menneskesøn du bli'r en mand en dag

[Vers 2]
Ingen baner vejen for dig
Du lærer selv hvordan
For med tro og håb og vilje
Vil du rejse fra dreng til mand

[Omkvæd]
Menneskesøn se himlens skær
La' din ånd slå vingeslag
Snart ved du, hva' du er værd
Menneskesøn du bli'r en mand en dag

[Vers 3]
Du lærer at forstå
Og forstå, hva' du har lært
Og tager din plads blandt dem du elsker højt
Alle drømmende du drømte
På junglens bløde tag
Nu er tiden næsten inde
Og alt bli'r dit en dag

[Omkvæd]
Menneskesøn se himlens skær
La' din ånd slå vingeslag
Snart ved du, hva' du er værd
Menneskesøn du bli'r en mand en dag

[Outro]
(Uh) I-yæh-uh
(Uh) I-yæh-uh
Menneskesøn
Menneskesøn er blevet en mand i dag



The fires are burning, ooh in another land
But don't start counting, ooh don't start counting

I'm going swiftly nowhere, heart in my ear

[Instrumental]



[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late

[Post-Choru]
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

[Bridge 1]
Well, I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Oh, but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

[Chorus]
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late

[Bridge 2]
Since then I've been running around, trying to find you
I went to the places that we always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, I went 'round there
Still don't believe it
He was just leaving

[Outro]
Oh, there must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
(There must be, there must be, oh-oh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, oh-oh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, oh-oh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, oh-oh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, oh-oh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, oh-oh)
Misunderstanding



There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late

Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that you always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, i went round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake



There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
And you were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Oh but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

Oh there must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
And you were late

Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that we always go
I rang your home but got no answer
So I jumped in my car
I went round again
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving

Oh there must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake, yeah

Oh there must be, oh there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
Oh there must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
Oh there must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
Oh there must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding



There must be some misunderstanding
Ooh, there must be some kind of mistake
Cause you left me in the rain for hours
And you were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
Well I checked your number twice, and i don't understand it
Well I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
I never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some misunderstanding
Aw listen, there must be some kind of mistake
Cause you left me in the rain for hours
And you were late

Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that you always go
Rang your house but got no answer
So jumped in my car, and i went round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving

There must be some misunderstanding
Oh there must be some kind of mistake
You know there must be some misunderstanding
Oh there must be some kind of mistake

There must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, no no
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, aw no
Misunderstanding

Misunderstanding, Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be, oh oh
Misunderstanding
There must be, there must be some kind of misunderstanding

You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstanding
You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstanding
You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstanding
You know there must be something, must be something, must be something, must be some, misunderstanding



[Verse 1]
Here am I
Who while away the mornings
Since you've gone
Too long have I lay alone
Not knowing which way to turn

And there you are
Quite sure that you were right
Knowing full well
That I'd be the first one to go down

[Chorus 1]
And you'd be the one who was laughing
Except when things weren't going your way
And then the lady would say that she'd had enough
Wandering around on her own

[Verse 2]
The day you left
Well I think you knew you'd not be back
Well at least it would seem that way
Because you never said goodbye
But when it comes 'round to you and me
I'm sure it will work out alright

[Chorus 2]
And you'd be the one who was laughing
And giving me something I don't need
And you know, I'd always hold you and keep you warm
Oh, more fool me

[Outro]
Ah, but when it comes
Round to you and me
I ask myself, "Do I really believe in your love?"
Yes, I'm sure it will work out alright



Here am I
While away the mornings, since you've gone
Too long have I layed alone
Not knowing which way to turn
And there you are
Quite sure that you were right
Knowing full well
That I'd be the first one to go down
And you'd be the one who was laughing
Except when things weren't going your way
And then the lady would say that she's had enough
Wandering around on her own
The day you left
Well, I think you knew you'd not be back
Well, at least it would seem that way
Because you never said goodbye
When it comes 'round to you and me
I'm sure it will work out alright
And you'd be the one who was laughing
Giving me something I don't need
And you know, I'd always hold you and keep you warm
Oh, more fool me
When it comes around to you and me
I ask myself, do I really believe in your love?
Yes, I'm sure it will work out alright



[Verse 1]
I can think of nowhere
I would rather be
Reading morning papers
Drinking morning tea

She clutches the tray
And then we talk just like a kitchen sink play
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Living so close to danger
Even your friends are strangers
Don't count upon their company

[Verse 2]
This is for the fingers
This is for the nails
Hidden in the kitchen
Right behind the scales

What do I care
I'm wasting fingers like I had them to spare
Plugging holes in the Zuiderzee
Punishing Paul for Peter
Don't ever trust those meters
What you believe is what you see

[Bridge]
In my town, there is a raincoat under a tree
In the sky, there is a cloud containing the sea
In the sea, there is a whale without any eyes
In the whale, there is a man without his raincoat

[Verse 3]
In another country
With another name
Maybe things are different
Maybe they're the same

Back on the trail
The seven soldiers read the papers and mail
But the news, it doesn't change
Swinging about through creepers
Parachutes caught on steeples
Heroes are born, but heroes die

Just a few days
A little practice and some holiday pay
We're all sure you'll make the grade
Mother of God, if you care
We're on a train to nowhere
Please put a cross upon our eyes

Take me
I'm nearly ready, you can take me
To the raincoat in the sky
Take me
My little pastry mother take me
There's a pie shop in the sky



I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, I'm Talking about my girl

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, I'm talking about my girl

I don't need no money fortune or fame
I got all the riches baby one man can claim
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl, I'm talking about my girl
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
My girl



(Instrumental)



["Loser" Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I’m out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I’m insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don’t believe everything that you breathe
You've got a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

["Loser" Hook]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

["The National Anthem" Verse 1]
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on

["The National Anthem" Verse 2]
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

["Loser" Hook]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Instrumental Interlude]

["In The Air Tonight" Chorus]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

["Loser" Verse 2]
Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
Cause one’s got a weasel and the other’s got a flag
One’s on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap with the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and its hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't get right if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who’s choking on the splinters

["In The Air Tonight" Chorus]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it in the air in the night, oh Lord, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

["In The Air Tonight" Chorus]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it oh, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord
["Loser" Hook]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?




There is never a time to say
'Cause it seems to me we've lost our way
So we carry on down the road
When we live our lives haunted by

All the things we say and do
Keep on missing when I'm alone
With you

No there's never a time to change
You don't get a chance to rearrange
It's a long, long way to go..
Just to find out something we both know

Can't you see what's going on?
It's so sad that a love so strong
Has gone

All I know is what is true
All I ask is for you
To just look around and see

You live your life locked in a dream
Where nothing is real and not what it seems
We can't go on another day
Just being afraid to say

'Cause it's a long, long way to fall
When we both thought we had it all
When you know there's a time to say
'Cause we're all played out; We've lost our way!

All I hoped that you would be
Was so understanding, and by now you'd see
But oh no...

So sad, ohh, so sad
That's the way that it goes, I know

I'm gonna tell you right now...

(end)



[Verse]
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone
You said there would be warm love in springtime
That was when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone
You said then you'd be the life in autumn
Said you'd be the one to see the way
I would never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away

[Outro]
Why didn't you stay?



[Verse 1]
It is so easy loving you
With everything I feel inside
And holding me the way you do
It is here I am staying all of my life

[Chorus]
I will never ever make you cry
I will never ever say goodbye
Can't you see it in my eyes?
I am yours until the day I die

[Verse 2]
I will watch you fall asleep at night
I will smile and kiss you, hold you tight
I will hold your hand and close my eyes
It is here I am staying all of my life

[Chorus][x2]



A cualquiera puedo lastimar
Mas con nada ya
Podria hacerme perdonar
Y lo que estuviera en mi poder
Haria sin vasilar
Pero ya nose por donde caminar

Oso fiel
Yo te falle, cofiaste en mi
Creiste en mi y aun asi falle
Por todo lo que te oculte
No tengo ya valor
Busco algo que...
O alguien que...
Alivie mi dolor

No hay solución
No hay claridad
Ya no hay salida
No tengo libertad
En un eterno anochecer
Que no puede amanecer



[Verse 1]
Well it's a long, long road when you're out there alone
No matter what side you're on
But there's a heart of gold behind the smile
And it brought me to where I belong
'Cos I'd set my sights on finding you
And I'm staying forever, you know it's true
Yes I'd set my sights on finding you
Don't be lonely tonight, we can make it alright

[Chorus]
No matter what you say
No matter who you are
Love always finds a way
Finds a way to your heart

[Verse 2]
Well it's a cold lonely road, but you can survive
No matter which way you choose
And as long as there's life behind these eyes
I'm here with you, win or lose
If you let your light shine on through
Someone will come round to pull you through
Yes just let your light shine on through
Don't be lonely tonight, you can make it alright

[Bridge]
Just hold my hand
Come with me a while, I'll make you smile
Just hold my hand
There's someone who loves you, it's me, oh it's me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's alright that you cry if you're lonely sometime
No matter who's by your side
'cos the love that you look for is inside us all
But it's something you have to find
And I'd set my sights on finding you
And I'm staying forever, you know it's true
Yes I'd set all my sights on finding you
Don't be lonely tonight, we can make it alright

[Chorus]



You can look at the menu
But you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions
But you can't have a seat

You can dip your foot in the pool
But you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment
But you can't commit the sin

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can build a mansion
But you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner
But you're not allowed to win

Some break the rules
And let you count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can see the summit
But you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle
But you just can't make it fit

Doctor says you're cured
But you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds
But your hopes go down the drain

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame



[Verse 1]
It will shine and it will shudder as I guide it with my rudder
On its metalled ways
It will cut the night before it as it leaves the day that saw it
On its metalled ways

Nobody passes us in the deep quiet
Of the dark sky
Nobody sees us alone out here
Among the stars

[Chorus] x 4
In these metal ways
In these metal days

[Verse 2]
Through a fault of our designing we are lost among the windings
Of these metal ways
Back to silence back to minus with the purple sky behind us
In these metal ways

Nobody hears us when we're alone
In the blue future
No one receiving the radio's splintered waves

[Chorus]



Kerchak
My worst fear
I hold it now
I always knew that this would happen
Though he's a child it's in his blood
And he will grow
So now it's clear what I must do
I know too well what he'll become
For as long as I draw breath
I'll remember

Kala
Where's Tarzan?
Where is he?

Kerchak
No turning back
What's done is done
I have seen what they can do
He can't be saved by you, by me
It's too late

Kala
No, I won't let you do this
How can you think?d

Kerchak
No more fighting I'll be obeyed
I'll stand my ground
Don't dare defy me
I know his kind
I know the truth
I will protect us
No other way
Open your eyes
It's there to see
No other way
He's not one of us
And never will be

Kala
Just listen to me

Kerchak
No more to say
He is what he is
And that won't change
There's no other way
I am leaving him here
And here he'll stay

Kala
He's just a child

Kerchak
He was up in the trees
Making a weapon
And in time it is us
He will hurt

Kala
No

Kerchak
Nothing and no one
Will stop him becoming
What he is
And was by blood

No other way
He won't come between me
And those I loved
Believe me when I say
With my body and soul
This I vow

Kala
But I need him!

Kerchak
No, no other way
In spite of your pain
It will be done
No matter what you say
He never was or could be
Be my son
There is no other way
I won't let him near
The rest of the tribe again

Kala
I understand

Kerchak
Where are you going?

Kala
To find him
We'll live away from the family

Kerchak
For how long?

Kala
For as long as he needs me

Kerchak
You can't
I won't be able to protect you
Kala don't do this
Please

Kala
Kerchak I'm his mother

Kerchak
No other way
I should have done this before
Long ago
And from today
Though they'll think of me cruel
They won't know
There was no other way



Kerchak
My worst fear
I hold it now
I always knew that this would happen
Though he's a child it's in his blood
And he will grow
So now it's clear what I must do
I know too well what he'll become

Talk to me, you never talk to me
Ooh, it seems that I can speak
I can hear my voice shoutin' out

But there's no reply at all

Look at me, you never look at me
Ooh, I've been sittin, starin', seems so long
But you're lookin' through me
Like I wasn't here at all

No reply. There's no reply at all

Dance with me, you never dance with me
Ooh, it seems that I can move
I'm close to you, close as I can get

Yet there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all

I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know

Be with me. Seems you're never here with me
Ooh, I've been tryin' to get over there
Oh, but it's out of my reach

And there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all

I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know

Maybe deep down inside
I'm tryin' for no one else but me
Too stubborn to say, "The buck stops here
It's not the one you're lookin' for."

But maybe deep down inside, I'm lyin'
To no one else but me
Oh, but my back is up. I'm on my guard
With all the exits sealed

Listen to me, you never listen to me
Oooh, and it seems there's no way out
I've been tryin' but we cannot connect

And there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
No reply at all
Is anybody list'nin?
Oh, there's no reply at all...

[Verse 1]
Got to get some food
I'm so hungry all the time
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop

[Verse 2]
Got to get some sleep
I'm so nervous in the night
I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop

[Verse 3]
I got to pick up the phone
I will call any number
I will talk to anyone
I know I've gone too far
Much too far I gone this time
I don't want to think what I've done
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop

[Bridge]
There are always hidden silences
Waiting behind the chair
They come out when the coast is clear
They eat anything that moves
I go shaky at the knees
Lights go out, stars come down
Like a swarm of bees

[Refrain]
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self control
No self...
No, no

[Verse 4]
You know I hate to hurt you
I hate to see your pain
But I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop

[Verse 5]
Street after street
Night after night
I walk on through the rain
I walk on through the rain
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Hey, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop



[Verse 1]
The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

[Verse 2]
I didn't think much about it
Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night
I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

[Pre-Chorus]
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said:

[Chorus]
You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

[Bridge]
You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

[Verse 3]
Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away
In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

[Pre-Chorus]
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straght in the eyes
He said:

[Chorus]
You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

[Outro]
You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you
You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son
You're no son
You're no son
You're no son
No son
No son
No son
You're no son
No son
No son
You're no son of mine



The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out

Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide

And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straght in the eyes
He said:

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you
You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son
You're no son
You're no son
You're no son
No son
No son
No son
You're no son
No son
No son
You're no son of mine



Well the key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out

Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night

I couldn’t stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And knew my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said:

You’re no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he’d say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straght in the eyes
He said:

You’re no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you’re no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you
You’re no son, no son of mine
You're no son
You're no son
You're no son
You're no son
No son
No son
No son
You're no son
No son
No son
You're no son of mine



Everywhere I turn, I hurt someone
But there's nothing I can say to change the things I've done
I'd do anything within my power
I'd give everything I've got
But the path I seek is hidden from me now

Brother bear
I let you down
You trusted me
Believed in me
And I let you down
Of all the things I hid from you
I cannot hide the shame
And I pray someone
Something will come
To take away the pain

There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
And I can't face another day



[Verse 1]
Everywhere I turn, I hurt someone
But there's nothing I can say to change
The things I've done
Of all the things I hid from you
I cannot hide the shame
And I pray someone, something will come
To take away the pain

[Chorus]
There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can be free
But I can't see another way
I can't face another day

[Verse 2]
Tell me where did I go wrong?
Everyone I loved, they're all gone
I'd do everything so differently
But I can't turn back the time
There's no shelter from the storm inside of me
Oh-oh-oh...

[Chorus]
There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can be free
But I can't see another way
Oh, and I can't face another day

[Bridge]
I can't believe the words I hear
It's like an answer to a prayer
When I look around I see (Oh, I can see)
This place, this time, this friend of mine
Ooo...

[Verse 3]
I know it's hard but you found somehow
To look into your heart
And to forgive me now
You've given me the strength to see
Just where my journey ends
You've given me the strength to carry on
Oh-oh-oh...

[Chorus]
I see the path from this dark place
I see my future
Your forgiveness has set me free
Oh, and I can see another way
I can face another day!

Yeah!
(I see the path)
I can see the path
(I see the future)
I see the path from this dark place
I see my future

I see the path
(I can see the path)
I see the future
I see the path



Nowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide

It's not love
I'm running from
It's the heartbreak
I know will come

'Cause I know
You're no good for me
But you've become
A part of me

Everywhere I go
Your face I see
Every step I take
You take with me, yeah

Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide

I know you're
No good for me
But free of you
I'll never be, no

Each night as I sleep
Into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you
Hoping soon that I'll forget you

When I look in the mirror
To comb my hair
I see your face
Just a-smiling there

Got nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Got nowhere to hide

I know you're
No good for me
But you've become
A part of me

How can I fight a lover
That shouldn't leave
When it's so deep, so deep
Deep inside of me

When my love is so high
I can't get over it
It's so wide
That I can't get around it, no

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
From you, baby
Just can't get away from you baby
No matter how I try

Well I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be

Got nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run, baby
Got nowhere to hide
Got nowhere ro run, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to hide



Off to sea, where my mind been lately
Tying bricks to my feet
Tryna come down for a day because all the shit that I see from this angle is driving me crazy
I’m trying to focus on me, but me and my mind have been Hazey
And it’s the fact that we out here and actually rapping
Killing the beat doesn’t actually happen when Some involved
But I ain’t dropping names, if you’re taking offense, know we’re not the same
They ain’t making a (?)
They ain’t got the brain. That’s factual
Actual definition of opposites. Wait till we really dropping shit
We’Lil explain who the topic is, getting paid I’m the profit extend the lane when I’m on it
Catching rings like I’m sonic
Demonic with the word flow but that kush do calm them nerves though
Burning bush  (?)
Listen learn more shit
My whole team the most focus
My new shit the most potent, sliding through my town like I been gliding through the ocean
I know if I was you I would be ducking me, 2 if you couldn’t fuck with me
Few of your homies bumping me daily either they playing me loud or looking for loud so they paging me
While you playing around I’m playing with numbers all day
(?)
Don’t give a fuck what you say frontin’
Because minus the mic, I’m still the life of the function and my team coming up now
You can make the assumption that I been kinda tryna separate your chest from your knees
Cut you in half and now I have to have 2 fake MC’s
This that west meets east shit. This that stress depletion
This that leaving the crib in a vest if you ain’t invested in me shit
Yeah I’m one in a million, been keeping it realer than most, and I know that
I could kill the whole game on any coast, and ima show that
You in the circle every single (?)
I don’t give a fuck what they say, I know they don’t stack
Opinions are irrelevant unless I’m out here selling shit
Or tryna get Some head from it and bitch tryna be celibate
(?)
Soaking like a well in it spelling it out to the amount there ain’t no pinpoint in even telling it
Spliffing the fifth joint, shit irrelevant, all of my relatives smoke
(?) we all intelligent folk man
You ain’t important
You’re too impotent
We all start rowing and we’re all In motion

4x

You’re walking while I pull up and park the arc by the dock and I go swim with the sharks



[Verse 1: Kaine]
Turn the lights off for me
Hard to hear, hard to see
Oh Lord
Not afraid of the trip
In a pool filled with sin
Oh Lord, oh Lord

[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Delleile & Kaine]
He said don't you run from me while I take it off
Take it off, take it off
Tell me your name while I break you off
Break you off, while I break you off
Don't you run from me while I take it off
Take it off, take it off
Tell me your name while I break you off
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Chorus: Delleile]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
When the rhythm hits, I'm not afraid to die
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
There's just way too many temptations

[Verse 2: Ben & All]
Feel my pulse as I breathe at 103
Oh Lord, oh Lord
I'm not afraid of the trip
In a pool filled with sin

[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Delleile & Kaine]
He said don't you run from me while I take it off
Take it off, take it off
Tell me your name while I break you off
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Chorus: Delleile & All]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Feel it coming, feel it coming
When the rhythm hits, I'm not afraid to die
Feel it coming
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Bridge: Ben & Kaine]
Don't you run from me, no no, no no
Don't you run from me
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Chorus: Delleile & All]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Feel it coming, feel it coming
When the rhythm hits, I'm not afraid to die
Feel it coming
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord



[Dance On A Volcano]
Holy Mother of God
You've got to go faster than that to get to the top
Dirty old mountain all covered in smoke
She can turn you to stone
You better start doing it right
Yes you better start doing it right
All right

You're halfway up and you're halfway down
The pack on your back keeps turning you around
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember
You don't look back whatever you do
Yes you better start doing it right
All right
Yes you better start doing it right

[The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway]
And the lamb lies down, down, down, down on Broadway

Early morning Manhattan
Ocean winds blow in off the land
Movie-Palace is now undone
The all-night watchmen have had their fun
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show
It's the same old ending - its time to go
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream
There is something moving in the sidewalk steam

And the lamb it lies down, down, down, down on Broadway

Night time flyers feel their pain
Drugstore takes down its chains
Metal motion comes in bursts
But the gas station can quench that thirst

Suspension cracked on an unmade road
The trucker's eyes they read 'Overload'
And out on the subway
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
He Exits in the daylight, spray gun hid

And the lamb it lies down, down, down, down on Broadway
On Broadway
On Broadway
On Broadway

They say the lights are always bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic, in the air

Tonight, tonight, tonight

They say the lights are always bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air

[The Musical Box]
She's a lady, she's got time
Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your face

She's a lady, she is mine
Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your flesh
(Just let me look)

I've been waiting here for so long
And all this time passed me by
It hardly seems to matter now, not now

You stand there with your fixed expression
Just casting doubt on all I have to say
Well why don't you touch me, touch me
Why don't you touch me, touch me
Touch me now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, na, ha now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, na, ha now

[Firth Of Fifth]
[Instrumental]

[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]
It's one o'clock and its time for lunch
Bum de dum de dum, dum, dum
When the sun beats down and I lie on me bench
I can always hear them talk

Ah there's always been Ethel
Jacob wake up, you've got to tidy your room now
And then Mister Lewis
Well isn't it time that he was out on his own?
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you!
Keep a them a mowing blades sharp

And I know what I like, and I like what I know
Ya know its getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show ooh show, show you show, show
I know, yes I know what I like, and I like I like what I know
Its getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show
Your show, you know that its your show
Its your show, know thats its your show
Know that its your show (I like)

[Break: "Tambourine Dance"]

When the sun beats down and I lie on me bench
I can always hear them talk
Me, I'm just a lawnmower
You can tell me by the way I walk
Walk!

[That's All]
Well I just as I thought it was going all right
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
Its always the same its just a shame that's all
And I could say day, and you'd say night
And tell it's black when I know that it's white
Its always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

[Illegal Alien]
No, no, no its no fun being an illegal alien
No, no its no fun being an illegal alien
Its no fun being an illegal alien
No, no, no, no, no its no fun being an illegal alien

[Your Own Special Way]
You have your own special way

[Follow You Follow Me]
And I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year
I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year there will be

[Stagnation]
[Instrumental]

[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]
Ye, ye, ye, ye, yes I know well I know what I like
And I like well I like what I know, I know, I know
Its getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show
Your show you know its your show



[Verse]
You now listenin' to a different type of boss
Abstract, they cut him from a different type of cloth
Jers say that Mouse went a different type of soft
Only started when I was lookin' at different type of lofts
Told 'em, I'm a don, show me somethin' with a pool next
And I need four bathrooms, it ain't gotta be a duplex
White tee, boots yes, see 'em in a suit next
Or somethin' European shirt lookin' like a 2X
Runnin' for the ball like I'm Plaxico Burress
Or in Cancun breakin' a back on a brunette
Gimmicks down pat like they rehearse that much
I don't respond to a sublime, it ain't hurt that much
Yea I scream out Jers that much
'Cause these other dudes fightin for New York like it's worth that much
And these sitcom niggas caress and hold bitches
To them they Golden Girls, to me, they old bitches
Chicks lookin' to G you, cons lookin' to cheat you
Owe a nigga money, you know he lookin' to see you!
Niggas lookin' to beat you
Fiends treat the hood like its Saw part two, 'cause they just lookin' for needles
I wake up grateful that I'm breathin' first
'Cause dudes'll kill you, they don't need a reason first!
These niggas'll still hit 'em
They know the hood is too poor to hire CSI, and Gil Grissom
Nowadays, gotta keep his blue steel with 'em
I know about snakes, 'cause I used to deal with 'em
Used to give my heart, used to rob, steal, with 'em
Let 'em meet mom, share my last meal with 'em
To rap now, you ain't gotta have skill with 'em
Just appeal (with 'em)...with a little rhythm
A dude has that and ready to attack y'all
You gotta kiss ass or else you get blackballed
If you don't like niggas, still give 'em dap y'all
I swear to God this hip hop shit is a trap y'all
I don't even remember how I used to act y'all
Something's wrong with the math, I know I can add y'all
I came out screamin' Desert Storm everyday
And soon as I stop, he don't wanna play
Stacks sayin' what you did for Clue, shit I just laced it
I didn't even know that dude was doin' his tape, shiiiitt
He don't want the fame no more, it's fuckin' with me
Don't hear Reasonable Doubt the same more
I can't listen to Blueprint (naaw!)
Got a resentment toward Hov', tryin' to hate on 'em, throwin' in my two cent
They say don't bite the hand that feeds you
Even if I wanted to, I can't, no teeth to
Don't get me wrong, still I love Clue and Hov'
But they both rich, so what that gotta do with Joe?!
I gotta bring home food for Joe...Trey that is...
Like, fuck why I say that shit?!
C4 why you take that shit?
But it's just how I feel, so naw, don't erase that shit
Child support's a bitch, but I take care of mine
But the law just say that I ain't there for mine
And the judge I look at (what about?)
Don't wanna hear, nor do he understand that things got pushed back
I'm sittin' here with all this anger, stop me
He's like what about this thing called a Gangsta Party?
Must think I live life like it's a Gangsta Party!
I'm 10 seconds away from a GANGSTA ROBBERY, NIGGA!!
No four leaf clover, I can't luck up
Feel like removin' the seeds and gettin' fucked up
Feelin' quick temper, somebody bound to get fucked up
I feel like everyone around me's a fuck up
Ratchet on me, I'm screamin' out "what what!"
'Bout to live life like my last buck's up
I ain't got time to run around stuck up
Not when I just seen a group of niggas gettin' stuck up
So you damn right, I'm on my grind
Look like some shit is on my mind niggas
Need to talk, but nobody to turn to
So I go to horoscopes in the Jersey Journal
It's always somethin' bad, I don't know why I read it
Then I play it off, it's fake, I don't believe it!
Smokin' like two packs a day
Still got about five cartons stashed away
And that's just were I'm at today
I'll be in a better place if I just passed away (sike!)
Just hop in the casket and lay
That's old school Mouse, move on, put the past away



[Instrumental]

We know you really only wanna hear

The things we like to say

But if I said to you please dont do it

You do it anyway

Sometimes I know, we gotta be cruel

Be cruel to be kind

When I ask you, what you see in me

You say our love is blind

Cos only you know and I know

The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know

The things we mean to say

Whenever I think I know you better

Better than I know myself

I open up and give you everything

Then you say, o.k. what else

And when I run away you always cry

You always over react

But I dont know if you know how you really feel

But you better know before I get back

Cos only you know and I know

The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know

The things we mean to say

Just try to remember

Now Im the one you love

You told me, ooh try to remember

Im the one youre always thinking of

You told me, please try to remember

Before I walk away

Remember

Its not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday

Cos only you know and I know

The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know

The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know

The things we mean to say, yes

Only you know and I know

The things we mean to say



[Verse 1]
We know you really only wanna hear
The things we like to say
But if I said to you please don't do it
You do it anyway
Sometimes I know, we gotta be cruel
Be cruel to be kind
When I ask you, what you see in me
You say our love is blind

[Chorus]
Because only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

[Verse 2]
Whenever I think I know you better
Better than I know myself
I open up and give you everything
Then you say, O.K. what else
And when I run away you always cry
You always over react
But I don't know if you know how you really feel
But you better know before I get back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Just try to remember
Now I'm the one you love
You told me, ooh try to remember
I'm the one you're always thinking of
You told me, please try to remember
Before I walk away
Remember
It's not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Only you know and I know...



You know we really only wanna hear
The things we like to say
But if I said to you, please don't do it
You do it anyway
Sometimes I know, we gotta be cruel
Be cruel to be kind
When I ask you, what you see in me
You say our love is blind
'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Whenever I think I know you better
Better than I know myself
I open up and give you everything
Then you say, okay, what else?
And when I run away, you always cry
You always overreact
But I don't know if you know how you really feel
But you better know before I get back
'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
You told me, you told me
Please try to remember before I walk away
Remember
It's not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday
'Cause only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Sometimes I know, we gotta be cruel
Be cruel to be kind
When I ask you, what you see in me
You say our love is blind
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know

Tell everybody I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
With blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be

Tell everybody I'm on my way
And I'm lovin' every step I take
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way
And I can't keep this smile off my face

'Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
No matter what the distance between
And the stories that we tell will make you smile
Oh it really lifts my heart

So tell 'em all I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more?
With the moon keeping watch over me

Not the snow, not the rain, can change my mind
The sun will come out wait and see
And the feeling of the wind in your face can lift your heart
Whoa, there's nowhere I would rather be

'Cause I'm on my way now
Well and truly
I'm on my way now

(whistling)

(I'm on my way now)
(I'm on my way now)
(I'm on my way now)

Tell everybody I'm on my way
(I'm on my way)
And I just can't wait to be there
(Just can't wait to be there)
With blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way
And nothing but good times to share

So tell everybody I'm on my way
And I just can't wait to be home
(Just can't wait to be home)
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way
And nothing but good times to show
I'm on my way
Yes, I'm on my way!



Well there's a place where two worlds collide
The pile of stone against the pull of the tide
You can stay with your feet on the ground
Or step into the water, leave the dry behind

On the shoreline
Meet me on the shoreline
Where you can only swim if you try

Well, if there's somewhere on the other side
It might be better, it might be as bad
Someday soon you'll have to make a move
Cos you can't stay forever, ah just waiting

On the shoreline (on the shoreline)
Meet me on the shoreline (on the shoreline)

Take me over, lead me through

Well can you take me there, to the other side
Where everything is new, uncertain and strange
Don't ever let me go till we're there
I don't know what it is I'm looking for
And until it's found I won't be sure...

Well, there are squares in the game of life
When you can keep on moving or turn aside
Yes, there are times when you have to decide
To put your feet in the water, or stay

On the shoreline (on the shoreline)
Meet me on the shoreline (on the shoreline)
Where you can only swim if you try
I'll be there - oh
On the shoreline (on the shoreline)
I'll be there on the shoreline (on the shoreline)
Where you can only swim if you try
I'll be there
I'll be there - oh
Yes, I'll be there
I'll be there...



[Verse 1]
You oughta know by now
That a man can't hold on forever
So why do you keep waiting here
When you know it makes me want you more?
You ought a know by now
How it fells to be loved
So why d'you keep me hanging here
With this stone around my heart, dragging me down, down, down

[Chorus]
When all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you
Let me in, let me in

[Verse 2]
You ought a know by now
Or maybe someone should show you
That a man needs to be loved
And even in this man's world
With you it don't come easy
You ought a know by now
That no man can sleep at night
With a burning in his heart
That would tear this man apart
Take me out of my misery

[Chorus]
Cause all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you
Let me in, let me in

[Verse 3]
You oughta know by now
Just how good it feels to be wanted
And no man could love you more
So why can't you show me something
Just a little bit of something?
You ought a know by now
All the things a man has to do in his life
And all these things I do
You know that I do it all for you, I do it all for you

[Chorus]
When all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you
Let me in, let me in

[Outro]
Let me in, let me in
Let me in your heart



[Verse 1: Phil Collins]
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothing but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma hung her head and said

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone

[Verse 2: Phil Collins]
Hey Momma!
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life?
And Momma, there some bad talk going round town that Papa had three outside children
And another wife
Heard them talk about Papa doing some store front preaching
Talked about saving souls and all the time leaching
Dealing in debt, stealing in the name of the law
Momma hung her head and said[?]

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Son, Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Oh yeah

[Verse 3: Phil Collins]
Come on, tell me, hey Momma
I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills

[Bridge: Phil Collins]
Folks say Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth

[Chorus:  Phil Collins]
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
You know. Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone



Paperlate, paperlate
Paperlate, paperlate

Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but there is no one on the line
Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news

Ooh it's too easy to live like clockwork
Tick tock watching the world go by
Any change would take too long
So dry your eyes
Ooh it's too easy to live in a cold sweat
Just sitting dripping in pools below
You can wipe your face
Kill the pain
But the fever won't go, no no

Paperlate
Pull it together now
Put your feet back on the ground
Paperlate
Ooh don't worry now
You're not alone
Look around you
Paperlate
Ooh I'm sorry but there's no one on the line
Paperlate
Ooh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news

Ooh it's too easy to compute your future
Taking no risks and playing too safe
Any change would take too long
So dry your eyes
Ooh it's too easy to talk about rocking the boat
Making changes and changing track
But you'd better not lock that door
Cos you'll be coming back

Ah you're breathing faster
Silence the only sound
There's no need to be nice on the way up
Cos you're not coming down

Paperlate, paperlate
Paperlate, paperlate
Paperlate, paperlate
Paperlate, paperlate

Paperlate
Ooh I'm sorry but there's no one on the line
Paperlate
Oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news...



Photogenic memory
Past looks better than reality
Believe me, it's just an illusion

Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him

You see her leave with him
You want him back again
But remember what your life was like

You can't forget the nights
You forget the lies and fights
You remember only the good times

Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him

Yesterday you have done him harm
Now you wanna be on his arm
Remember the way he pretended

Yesterday he was history
Now today he's all you see
You remember the way that it ended

Photogenic memory
Past looks better than reality
Believe me, it's just an illusion

Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him

Slip away before you fall
Rip the phone out of the wall when he calls
Anything to keep him out
Out of your new life that he inspires

Photogenic memory
Past looks better than reality
Believe me, you're better without him

Slip away before you fall
Rip the phone out of the wall when he calls
Anything to keep him out
Out of your new life that he inspires

It's a photogenic, photogenic
Photo-photogenic memory, yes sir
It's a photogenic, photogenic
Photo-photogenic memory, yes sir

It's a photogenic, photogenic
Photo-photogenic memory, yes sir
It's a photogenic, photogenic
Photo-photogenic memory

Who puts fifty tons of shit on the Foreign Office roof?
Who suffers from nine known diseases?
Who gets up in the morning when the sun comes up
And makes their beds, of paper clips, and bus tickets
All around their heads?
Who congregate around Trafalgar Square
Taking pot shots at the tourists?
Oh you've got to watch out
When you wander round the square in the morning
They're everywhere, they're everywhere

Here we have an honest man
A civil servant to boot
He lived high up in the Ministry
And when he wished to make a point
He knew just what to do
His window ledges were all covered in grease
I want them out of here

He said to me I want them gone
Because you see -- Oh don't you see
None of us are getting any younger
You've got to follow your nose
And if it tells you that you've got to go
Well that's because, they're everywhere
They're everywhere

So we called in those men, those horrible men
And set them to work on the rooftops
You see their van is very plain
And I know they're too ashamed
To wear their by appointment badges anymore
Sometimes they use vaseline, sometimes they use the pill
I've often seen them with a gun
But as the years go by, old habits seem to die
And nowadays they knockatize them all
Oh you've got to watch out
As you wander round the square in the morning
They're everywhere, they're everywhere



[Verse]
Please come out tonight i need you here
Its been a long, long time and i can't wait
Let's find out, let's see what it's like out there
If it rains we'll find somewhere, somewhere dry and warm
You'll say "my, it's been a long, long time"
I'll say "how are you? I've been fine"
Please come out tonight, let's go out and see the world
We can try to find, find somewhere
It seems so long ago, i can hardly remember the time
It's all i want, it's all i want, so let's see what we find
You'll say "there's so much you need to know"
I'll say "are you really sure you have to go?"
We don't need a reason, no explanation
Just stay with me here, tonight
I won't say a word
I just need you here
Please come out tonight, let's go out and find ourselves
You can lean your head on my shoulder, remember?
You'll say "my, is that the time?"
I'll say "why not stay with me tonight?"
We don't need a reason
It's so warm inside
There's no one between us
If someone comes we can hide
Just lay here beside me
Just see what it's like
Please come out tonight

[Outro]
Please come out tonight[x2]
Please come out, please come out
Please come out tonight
Will you stay with me tonight
Lay with me tonight
Please come out, come out tonight
Just lay with me[x2]
Please come out tonight



Please don't ask me how I feel, I feel fine
Oh I cry a bit, don't sleep too good, but I'm fine
When can I see you?
When can I touch you?

Again and again I ask myself was I wrong?
Oh but time's a healer, and heaven knows I've been strong
Maybe we could try
Maybe we could work this time

I can remember when it was easy to say I love you
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do
But I can try
I know that the kids are well, you're a mother to the world
But I miss my boy
I hope he's good as gold

But enough of me, tell me how are you? You look good
Oh you lost weight I can see, your hair looks nice, you look good
Maybe we should try, don't say it! I know why

I can remember when it was easy to say I love you
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do
But I can try
I know the kids are well, you're a mother to the world
But I miss my boy
I hope he's good as gold



["Sledgehammer" by Peter Gabriel]
You could have a big dipper

Why don't you call my name
Let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony, yeah, yeah yeah

Pussycat's going to London
Looking for love and for fame
I wish somebody had told her
City folks ain't the same

Pussycat carries a postcard
Won't the big city be nice?
That's the place with the action
She's gonna have her a slice

Pussycat, pussycat
Where have you been?
I've been to London
And now I'm queen

Sitting pretty
I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me
Puss'n boots

Pussycat laughs at the warnings
Where there's a will there's a way
I think you'd agree if you saw her
Rome's built in a day

Pusscat's read all the papers
Seen the movie and knows
All of the streets lead to somewhere
And the pavement's gold

Pussycat, pussycat
Where have you been?
I've been to London
And now I'm queen

Sitting pretty
I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me
Puss'n boots

Although you know it's wrong
We must do it everyday
When the morning comes
Don't you turn around and say

It's the bound to end in tears
So let's do it anyway

Pussycat wasn't a kitten
Not as dumb as they thought
She had a good head on her shoulders
And beauty that couldn't be bought

The royalty made her an offer
If she'd keep trouble at bay
They'd give her the money and diamonds
Be queen for a day!

Pussycat, pussycat
Where have you been?
I've been to London
And now I'm queen

Sitting pretty
I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me
Puss'n boots

Pussycat, pussycat
Where have you been?
I've been to London
And now I'm queen

Sitting pretty
I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me
Puss'n boots

Pussycat, pussycat
Where have you been?
I've been to London
And now I'm queen

Sitting pretty
I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me
Puss'n boots

Pussycat, pussycat
Where have you been?
I've been to London
And now I'm queen

Sitting pretty
I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me
Puss'n boots

Pussycat, pussycat
Where have you been?
I've been to London
And now I'm queen

Sitting pretty
I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me
Puss'n boots

Il y a tant à voir
Tant à savoir
Le temps d'une vie
Là bas quelque part
T'attend l'espoir
Si tu veux bien y croire

Ne te caches pas
Ne vas pas
Ça ira pour toi
Toujours crois moi
Je serais là
Pour guider tes pas

Regardes la vie dans mes yeux
Un plus bel endroit t'attend là bas
Regarde la vie dans mes yeux
Et tu changeras
Une fois là bas c'que tu vois?
Si tu regarde dans mes yeux

Il y aura
Dans ton voyage
Des jours pleins de nuages
Mais quelque part
Brille l'espoir
Si tu veux bien y croire

Ne te caches pas
Ne vas pas
Ça ira pour toi
Toujours crois moi
Je serais là
Pour guider tes pas

Regardes la vie dans mes yeux
Un plus bel endroit t'attend là bas
Regarde la vie dans mes yeux
Et tu changeras
Une fois là bas c'que tu vois?
Si tu regarde dans mes yeux

Tout ce que tu peux changer
Toute chose peut s'expliquer
Tu trouveras tout c'que tu veux
Il y a tant à apprendre

Regardes la vie dans mes yeux
Un plus bel endroit t'attend là bas
Regarde la vie dans mes yeux
Et tu changeras
Une fois là bas c'que tu vois?
Si tu regarde dans mes yeux

Regardes la vie dans mes yeux
Un plus bel endroit t'attend là bas
Regarde la vie dans mes yeux
Et tu changeras
Une fois là bas c'que tu vois?
Si tu regarde dans mes yeux

Regarde la vie ... x2

Struggling down the slope
There's not much hope
I begin to try to ride the scree
But the rocks are tumbling all around me

If I want John alive
I've got to ditch my fear, take a dive
While I've still got my drive to survive

(Evel Knievel you got nothing on me)

Here I go!



[Verse 1]
If we can cross at the place that divides us
Cross the river, the river so wide
If we can smother the pain that's inside us
Deny the demons that wait bu our side
We can find, find the light

[Chorus 1]
Our nights are filled with the light of the same moon
We share the comfort of the same stars
Our days are bright with the light of the same sun
That don't matter, can't you see what we are
What we are, what we become?

[Chorus 2]
Keep our sights on the way ahead
Don't look back, it won't help us now
The storm we left so far behind
Seems a dark memory that starts to fade
But till we see the light we will not be safe

[Verse 2]
We all sink or swim in the same ocean
Break our skin and we will bleed
Our minutes pass with the same motion
We face the same danger, we share the same needs
We're all the same, you and me

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]



The streets were deserted though the police were alerted
They considered the phone call a hoax
Furtively glancing then jauntily prancing
The youth caught the guards unaware

Slipping between them, he ought to have seen them
The eyes and their owner so near
With torch shining bright he strode on in the night
Till he came to the room with the safe

"Hello son, I hope you're having fun!"
"You've got it wrong, sir, I'm only the cleaner"
With that he fired, the other saying as he died
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever, forever

Robbery, assault and battery
The felon and his felony
Robbery, assault and battery
The felon and his felony

He picked up the diamonds and bundles of fivers
He pushed them well down in his sack
But the alarm had been sounded, he was completely surrounded
But he had some more tricks up his sleeve

"Come outside with your hands held high!"
"You'll not get me alive, sir, I promise you that, sir"
With that he fired, the other saying as he died
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever, forever

Robbery, assault and battery
The felon and his felony
Robbery, assault and battery
The felon and his felony

"He's leaving via the roof, the bastard's got away!
God always fights on the side of the bad man
Bad man, bad man, bad man"

I've got clean away but I'll be back some day
Just the combination will have changed
Some day they'll catch me, to a chain they'll attach me
Until that day I'll ride the old crime wave

If they try to hold me for trial
I'll stay out of jail by paying my bail
And after I'll go to the court of appeal saying
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever, forever

Done me wrong, same old song
Done me wrong, same old song
Done me wrong, same old song

Done me wrong, same old song
Done me wrong, same old song
Done me wrong, same old song

Done me wrong, same old song
Done me wrong, same old song
Done me wrong, same old song



[Verse 1]
I am sorry baby, but I cannot afford to stay
Your good, kind treatment will worry me someday
I love you baby, but I am going to have to say goodbye
Woman, I got to move, I really got to fly

[Chorus]
Same thing every morning
Tell me what is it all about
I get those same old blues every night

[Verse 2]
I miss you already, baby, more than words can say
Seems like I have been gone twenty-four hours, more like a million days
I love you baby, you know I would not tell you no lies
If you do not believe I love you, look at the tears standing in my eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Here I am back home, baby, I am back home to stay
I love you babe, never more will I go away
I will not hurt you no more, baby, no going to tell you no more lies
No more running around, no more phony alibis

Little Nemo rubbed his eyes and got out of bed
Trying hard to piece together a broken dream
His visions lifelike and full of imagination
It's strange to think they came from such a tiny head

Dragons breathing fire, but friendly
Mushrooms tall as houses
Giant nymphs and goblins playing
Scenes from a night's dream, poor little Nemo!

Eating all kinds of food so close to bedtime
They always made him have these nightmares, it seemed

Helped young Washington in the garden
Cut the cherry tree down
Now we all know that's not history
Scenes from a night's dream, poor little Nemo!

"Nemo, get out of bed!"
"Don't tell me stories, I don't want to know!"
"Come on you sleepy head, we're waiting to go!"

Once he went to the 'Carnival of Nations'
Dancing with the princess through the night

Found themselves on a moving platform
Ten ton weights above them
Seeking audience with King Morpheus
Scenes from a night's dream, poor little Nemo!

"Nemo, get out of bed!"
"Don't tell me stories, I don't want to know!"
"Come on you sleepy head, we're waiting to go!"



[Verse 1]
Die Kameras sind schon lange hier
Reporter stehen Spalier
Heute ist es anders, heute nicht wie sonst
Heute mach ich es endlich, hen Schnappschuss in das Licht
Schnappschuss in das Licht, Ich ziele in das Licht

[Verse 2]
Vier Strassen noch braucht der Zug
Den Fahrer blendet die Sonne
Gewehr hinterm Fensterkreuz, Keiner sieht's in der Kolonne
Drei Strassen noch, die Kreuzung ist frei
Jetzt faengt der Jubel an
Du hoerst im Radio, Was dieser Mann alles kann

[Bridge 1]
Ich, zeig es euch jetzt
Ich, zeig es euch jetzt
Ihr glotzt nur auf die Scheibe
Nummer fuer die Datenbank
Einen Schuss brenn ich euch in den Kopf
Lerr, ausgetraeumt und krank
Nur ich, ich lebe

[Verse 3]
Sie kommen um die Ecke motorradschutz ganz vorn
Ich wisch den Schweiss von der Stirn
Von unten Gebruell, ich werde ganz still
Im andern Wagen faehrt der Gouverneur
Doch ihn hab ich nicht im Visier
Du bist, Held des Tages, Stolz im Cadillac

[Bridge 2]
"Du bist nicht zum Hassen, eigentlich ganz egal
Wir brauchen uns beide, perfekte Wahl
Ich will Liebe von allen, wie bei dir soll es sein
Was du nicht kriegst musst du holen
Und ich hol dich jetzt ein."
Atem stoppt
Abzug springt
Und die kugel durch den Lauf

[Outro]
Diese Stille - was kann ich dafuer?
Einsamer Junge hinter der Tuer
Die Freunde sind alle weg
Da ist mein Spielzeuggewehr
Wo seid ihr, Mama und Papa
Ihr redet nicht mehr, ich werd trauriger Jahr fuer Jahr
Schaut mich an
Ich ziele in das Licht



Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom
Just waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance like photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

As we relive our lives in what we tell you



You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were
Leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes
When you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I can't go on just holding on to times
So for now we'll go on living separate lives
Well I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me
Well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living separate lives
Ooh, it's so typical
Love leads to isolation
So you build that wall
Yes you build that wall
And you make it stronger
Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Someday I might find myself looking in your eyes
But for now we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now we'll go on living separate lives



[Verse 1]
You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon

Do i feel lonely too?

[Chorus]
You have no right to ask me how i feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I can't go on just holding on to time
Now that we're living separate lives

[Verse 2]
Well i held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

[Bridge]
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger

[Chorus]

Heard the old man tell his tale:

Tinker, alone within a storm
And losing hope he clears the leaves beneath a tree
Seven stones lay on the ground
Within the seventh house a friend was found
And the changes of no consequence
Will pick up the reins from nowhere

Sailors, in peril on the sea
Amongst the waves a rock looms nearer, and not yet seen
They see a gull flying by
The Captain turns the boat and he asks not why
And the changes of no consequence
Will pick up the reins from nowhere, nowhere

Despair that tires the world brings the old man laughter
The laughter of the world only grieves him
Believe him
The old man's guide is chance

I heard the old man tell his tale:

Farmer, who knows not when to sow
Consults the old man clutching money in his hand
And with a shrug
The old man smiled
Took the money, left the farmer wild
And the changes of no consequence will pick up the reins from nowhere
Nowhere

Despair that tires the world brings the old man laughter
The laughter of the world only grieves him
Believe him
The old man's guide is chance



Apri le tue braccia a chi ti cerca
Se vuoi, ti troverà
Anche se, non sai perché
È un figlio come te

Un paradiso intatto che
Vive di pace e vivrà
Per sempre con semplicità

Senti come è calda questa sabbia
Se vuoi, ti scalderà
Fidati del sole che
Vedrai ti guiderà

Una famiglia dove c'è
Sole, vento e umanità
È semplice, ma basterà

E al momento che servirà
Lotta per la libertà
Difendi te e chi non può
Se semini amore
L'amore ti tonerà

E chi potrà asciugare mai
Il pianto di una madre che
Nel suo dolore continuerà

È il tuo cuore che ti sta parlando
Se vuoi, lo sentirai
Lascialo, decidere
Non ti deluderà



Ogni giorno c'è una prova dura
Se vuoi, la vincerai
Fidati del sole che
Vedrai ti guiderà



[Chorus]
She is waiting for another love
She is waiting for another love

[Verse 1]
She has been waiting for another love
Someone that she can show into her heart
And when she finally finds a stronger love
Your whole world is going to fall apart

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You have been abusing her for far too long
Think you are a king and she is your pawn
Get ready now, cause pretty soon
She will be gone and you will be on your own

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I see the hunger burning in her eye
Any fool could see there is something wrong
You keep pretending not to care
But I will hear you sing a different song

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Waiting for another lover
Hoping for the time that she will find another



Light up my life with a smile
Every day
I can tell you heaven is just a
Breath away
Deep within my heart, there's a love
I feel for you
And I want you to know, that you
You don't have to walk around
Feeling lonely, lost for lovin', when
The sun goes down
Cause I wanna give you what
You need
Let me inside

I'll show you the way to love uh huh
Uh huh
I'll show you the way to love uh huh
Will you let me inside?

All of my life I believed love
Was true
And the pictures in my mind, they
Were only of you
Let me be the one to hold you safe
In my arms
When the magic is won
Then you, like a fire in the night
We can feel the heat
And it's going deep 'till it melts
Away, all the cold
Making everything right, will you
Be mine?

I'll show you the way to love uh huh
Uh huh
I'll show you the way to love uh huh
Will you let me inside?

Love is the future
You can throw your fears away
Love is the past
Love has brought us to this
Day, baby
Time won't keep waiting
For an answer from your heart
To love

I'll show you the way to love uh huh
Uh huh
I'll show you the way to love uh huh
Will you let me inside?



[Instrumental]



Rivers flow uphill
Blue turns into grey
Winter follows springtime
Morning ends the day
Beyond the silver rainbow

If you're walking home beside her
And you know what time it is
And if you avoid the puddles in your way
You haven't been there either
To the land that lies
Beyond the silver rainbow

But if you're walking home beside her
And the sun should turn to blue
And you keep on going, 'cos you're unaware
Ooh, then you know that you are there

Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going
Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going
Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going

Ooh, if you're sitting there beside her
With your arms you hold her close
And you're wondering just how far she'll let you go
You haven't been there either
To the land that lies
Beyond the silver rainbow

But if you're sitting there beside her
And a bear comes in the room
And you keep on going 'cause you're unaware
Oo, then you know that you are there

Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going
Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going
Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going
Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going
Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going
Beyond the Silver Rainbow (Beyond the Silver Rainbow)
(You won't know) you won't know if you're coming or going



[Verse 1]
It seems in a moment, your whole world can shatter
Like morning dreams they just disappear
Like dust in your hand falling to the floor
How can life ever be the same

[Chorus]
Cos my heart is broken in pieces
Yes my heart is broken in pieces
Since you've been gone

[Verse 2]
It's all to easy to take so much for granted
But it's so hard to find the words to say
Like a castle in the sand the water takes away
How can life ever be the same

[Chorus]
Cos my heart is broken in pieces
Yes my heart is broken in pieces
Since I've lost you

[Bridge]
Ooh now you'll never see
Ooh now you'll never know
All the things I planned for you
Things for you and me

[Verse 3]
I held your hand so tightly
That I couldn't let it go
Now how can life ever be the same

[Chorus]
Cos my heart is broken in pieces
Yes my heart is broken in pieces
Since you've been gone



Oh, das Wissen macht dich stark
Gibt dir Kraft, du selbst zu sein
Alles and're lernst du mit der Zeit
Stehst am Anfang deiner Reise
Du weißt nicht, was vor dir liegt
Aber du wirst dich beweisen
Auch wenn es Fragen gibt

So ein Mann setzt alles ein
So ein Mann ist wie ein Held
So ein Mann kann alles sein
So ein Mann ist dann ein Kind der Welt

Manchmal fehlen dir die Freunde
Niemand nimmt dich bei der Hand
Mit Verständnis und viel Liebe
Wird aus dir bald ein starker Mann

So ein Mann setzt alles ein
So ein Mann ist wie ein Held
So ein Mann kann alles sein
So ein Mann ist dann ein Kind der Welt

Ein Schüler warst du erst
Und ein Lehrer wirst du sein
Das alles wirst du irgendwann versteh'n
Oh und alle deine Träume
Und was dein Auge sah
Sie bleiben bei dir ewig
Sind immer für dich da

So ein Mann setzt alles ein
So ein Mann ist wie ein Held
So ein Mann kann alles sein
So ein Mann ist dann ein Kind der Welt
So ein Mann, so ein Mann
Sieht dann die ganze Welt

[Chorus 1 - Phil Collins ]
You got to give me some
Give me some of your loving
You got to give me some of your loving

[Chorus 2 - Phil Collins ]
Now I'm not a greedy guy
So don't ask me why
(Just give me some)
Some of your loving now, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1 - Phil Collins ]
Now I don't expect you to guarantee
Your faith and devotion to only me
I'm aware you got a lot of wild oats to sow
But baby when I need you
Don't you tell me no

[Chorus 1 - Phil Collins ]
You got to give me some
Give me some of your loving
You got to give me some of your loving

[Chorus 2  Phil Collins]
Now I'm not a jealous child
My demands are mild
(Just give me some)
Some of your loving now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I know a girl likes to feel that she's been around
Before she decides to settle down
I've no doubt
Some day you're going to feel that way too
But baby, just remember
(Until you do)

[Chorus 1 - Phil Collins ]
You got to give me some
Give me some of your loving
You got to give me some of your loving

[Chorus 2 - Phil Collins ]
Now I'm not a greedy man
But I don't wanna pick
(Just give me some)
Some of your loving now, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Ah, you got to give me some of your loving
(yes you do now)
You got to give me some of your lovin
Some of your loving
Well, I need to tell you
Oh, I need your love so bad
Ah, you got to give me some of your loving
You got to give me some of your lovin
Some of your loving
You got to give me some of your lovin
Some of your loving
You got to give me some of your lovin
Some of your loving
(You got to give me some)



[Verse 1]
Darling, darling
If I could have you to call my very own
I work my fingers through the bone, I am alone
To you I'd always come home

[Chorus]
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

[Verse 2]
Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you set my soul on fire
I need you, yeah, badly
No matter what price I have to pay
Because without you, darling, I'd worry hard
I love you anyway

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you're my only desire

I'm just your puppet on a string
And tears sometimes it brings
But do me any way you wanna when you wanna
I'll keep you just the same

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
You're a real heart breaker
You will never let me sit down
There's something about you, baby
That shakes me all up inside
You're a real heart breaker
And I need you just the same



[Verse 1]
We had a life, we had a love
But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back
How many times I'm gonna say I'm sorry?
(How many times?)
Oh, yes, I'm sorry

How can something so good go so bad?
How can something so right go so wrong?

And I want you back
How many times I'm gonna say I'm sorry?
(How many times?)

But something happened on the way to heaven
It got a hold of me and wouldn't let go
And I want you back

Oh, yes, I'm sorry
(Sorry)
Well, you know

When you go
And I believe it
But taking what I've got
Or being here with you, you know
I'd rather leave it

A girl
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere

There's a time for us
Some day a time for us
Time together with time spare
Time to learn, time to care
Some day!

Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere . . 

There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
Some day
Somewhere!



[Verse 1]
Oh the power to be strong
And the wisdom to be wise
All these things will come to you in time
On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll seek
And it's you who'll climb the mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

[Bridge]
Though there's no one there to guide you
No one to take your hand
But with faith and understanding
You will journey from boy to man

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

[Verse 2]
In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the
Ones you love
Oh and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's your's to claim it all

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

[Outro]
Son of man
Son of man's, a man for all to see



[Verse 1]
Oh the power to be strong
And the wisdom to be wise
All these things will come to you in time
On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll seek
And it's you who'll climb the mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

[Verse 2]
In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the
Ones you love
Oh and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's your's to claim it all

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

Son of man
Son of man's, a man for all to see



Oh, the power to be strong
And the wisdom to be wise
All these things will
Come to you in time

On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll seek
And it's you who'll climb the mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak

Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

Though there's no one there to guide you
No one to take your hand
But with faith and understanding
You will journey from boy to man

Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside
The ones you love

Oh, and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's yours to claim it all

Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

Son of man
Son of man's a man for all to see



[Chorus]
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Can't you see me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

[Verse]
I want to run but there's no way to go
Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, a love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
Because you've taken away all of my reasons for living
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute
Didn't I treat you right, now baby didn't I
Didn't I do the best I could, now didn't I, didn't I?
So don't you leave me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Trying the best to get ready for the heartaches to come
All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
It may come today, and it might come tomorrow
But it's for sure I've ain't got nothing but sorrow
Now won't your conscience kinda bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you?
Now hold on a minute
Gave you all the love I had, now didn't I
When you needed me I was always there, now wasn't I
Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
I'm trying not to cry out loud
You know crying, it ain't going to help me none

[Bridge]
What did I do to cause all this grief?
Now what did I say to make you want ti leave?
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you now didn't I
And didn't I always treat you good now didn't I

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, I'm standing in the shadows of love



[Verse 1]
If you ever had the time
You would try to make it fine
If your promises were real
Then maybe love is what I'd feel
But you seem to be so sad
Like a fairytale gone bad
And I don't know what to say
But I can't keep playing games

[Chorus]
I can't stay now, I can't stay now
Or walk away, or turn away
I can't stay now, I can't stay now
Or walk away, or turn away

[Verse 2]
So I stayed alone tonight
Hoping things might turn out right
Wonder if you feel the same
Maybe I'm as much to blame

[Chorus]
I can't stay now, I can't stay now
Or walk away, or turn away
I can't stay now, I can't stay now
Or walk away, or turn away

[Verse 3]
As the candle burns away
I want you another day
Reading letters that you've sent
Well is it consciences you meant
If I stay with you tonight
Though I know It won't be right
If I turn the other way
There'll be nothing else to say

[Chorus]
I can't stay now, I can't stay now
Or walk away, or turn away
I can't stay now, I can't stay now
Or walk away, or turn away



TARZAN:
Whatever you do, I'll do it too
Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me

I can see there's so much to learn
It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as others see me
I just know there's something bigger out there

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar 'bout these strangers like me

Every gesture
Every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

These emotions I never knew
Of some other world, far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar 'bout these strangers like me

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel right now with you
Take my hand, there's a world you need to know

JANE:
I can’t explain the way I feel
Everything I wanted is here
And my heart is beating faster
Every moment I’m with him I feel so complete
I cannot deny what I’m feeling

TARZAN:
I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something is familiar 'bout these strangers like me

I wanna know



[Verse 1]
Whatever you do, I'll do it too
Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me

I can see there's so much to learn
It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as people see me
Oh, i just know there's something bigger out there

[Chorus]
I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

[Verse 2]
Every gesture, every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

[Chorus]
I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

[Bridge]
Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand
There's a world I need to know

[Chorus]
I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

[Outro]
...I want to know



Whatever you do, I do it too
Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me

I can see there's so much to learn
It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as people see me
I just know there's something bigger out there

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar 'bout these strangers like me

Every gesture
Every move that she makes

This growing need to be beside her

These emotions I never knew
Of some other world, far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar 'bout these strangers like me

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel right now with you
Take my hand, there's a world I need to know

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something is familiar 'bout these strangers like me

I wanna know



(Instrumental)



[Lovers' Leap]

Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motor cars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
...And it's hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
...And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time. Hasn't it?

[The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man]

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again, can't you see he's fooled you all
Share his peace
Sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside
Hand in hand
Gland in gland
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

[Ikhnaton And Itsacon And Their Band Of Merry Men]

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors
Standing still below the ground
Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace...bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang...
And they're giving me a wonderful potion
'Cos I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

[How Dare I Be So Beautiful?]

Wandering through the chaos the battle has left
We climb up a mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped "Human Bacon" by some butchery tool
(He is you)
Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower?

[Willow Farm]

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise, everyone lies
Like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum & Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince, the prince was a brick, the brick was an egg
The egg was a bird
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail)
Hadn't you heard?
(They're going to change you into a human being!)
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in
We've got some out
We've got some wild things floating about
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all
We've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear

ALL CHANGE!

Feel your body melt;
Mum to mud to mad to dad
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball

Dad to dam to dum to mum
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear you lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooee-ooee-ooee-oowaa
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang
And all of us fit in our places

[Apocalypse In 9/8 (Co-Starring the delicious talents of Gabble Ratchet)]

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise
It won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your back bone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true
I've been so far from here
Far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again, and babe it's gonna work out fine

[As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs (Aching Men's Feet)]

Can't you feel our souls ignite
Shedding ever changing colours, in the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean, as the germ in a seed grows
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun, and he's crying with a loud voice
"This is the supper of the mighty one"
Lord of Lords
King of Kings
Has returned to lead his children home
To take them to the new Jerusalem



Kala
It's nice to see you play with the children

Kerchak
Why do you say that?
I do it all the time

Kala
You don't

Kerchak
I do

Kala
You don't

Kerchak
I don't?

Kala
You don't, you know?
It's nice to see you smiling and laughing

Kerchak
What do you mean?
I do it all the time

Kala
You don't

Kerchak
I do

Kala
You don't

Kerchak
I don't

Kala
No, you don't, you know
You're my husband
My friend, our leader
You're the one that I love completely

Kerchak
I am?

Kala
You are, you know you are

Kerchak
You can't imagine the weight on my shoulders

Kala
I know too well how hard it must be

Kerchak
You don't

Kala
I do

Kerchak
You don't

Kala
Oh yes I do, you know
You're my husband
My friend, our leader
But a little chink in your armor might be nice

Kerchak
Really?

Kala
It might be nice

BOTH
There was sunshine
There was family
There was our life, side by side
This was home

Kala
As sure as sun turns to moon will I love you

Kerchak
And I will be there to answer your call

Kala
You will?

Kerchak
I will

Kala
You really will?

Kerchak
I swear I will

Kala
It would be nice to see you more often

Kerchak
Why don't you come back for I miss you so

Kala
You do?

Kerchak
I do

Kala
But you know I can't come back alone



[Verse 1]
No i never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Please forgive me
I never meant to break your heart
I'd give my last breath before i do
Please forgive me
No i never meant to hold you down
I never meant to break your heart
Somehow, somehow
We are survivors
No i never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Here we are standing here

[Chorus]
Survivors in the night
Survivors in the night

[Verse 2]
No i never meant to break your heart
I'll always be here for you
Here's my word, take my hand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No i never meant to let you down
I'd give my last breath before i do
All i ever wanted was to be right here

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
When all is said and done
We'll find a way
To put all this behind us
We'll find some way
Cause you know that i won't be leaving
Yes i'm here and i won't be leaving
No i never meant to cause you pain
No i never meant to hurt you
All i want to do now, is to try my best

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
When all is said and done
We'll find someday
We can forget all this
Somehow, some way
And as long as i'm here
There will be no worries any more
And all these promises i'm making now
I'll hold each day
So don't ever. Don't ever, don't forget
That i never, never meant to break your heart
All i ever wanted was to stand beside you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We are survivors [x10]



[Intro]
There's a girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Ah, if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere, she's all I need, all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Su-Sussudio, just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Sussudio

[Chorus 1]
Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh
Ooh, give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime, Su-Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
I feel so good if I just say the word, Su-Su-Sussudio
Just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh

[Chorus 2]
Ah, she's all I need, all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word, Su-Su-Sussudio
I just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Su-Sussudio
I just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Sussudio
I'll say the word, oh, S-Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Just say the word
Just say the word, ooh
Just say the word

S-Su-Su-Sussudio, Su-Su-Sussudio
Su-Su-Sussudio, Su-Su-Sussudio
Sussudio, Su-Su-Sussudio

Just say the word, Su-Su-Sussudio
Just say the word, oh
Just say the word



There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Sussusudio oh oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Sussusudio oh oh

Oh if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere
She's all I need, all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Sussusudio, just say the word
Oh Sussusudio

Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun
Sussusudio oh oh
Ooh give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime
Sussusudio oh oh

I feel so good if I just say the word
Sussusudio I just say the word
Oh Sussusudio I just say the word
Oh Sussusudio I'll say the word
Sussusudio oh oh oh
Just say the word



Just that sweet little mystery that breaks my heart
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry
O that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

My friends all tell me that I look so sad
They don't need to ask me why
They know the reason that I feel so bad
Since the night you said goodbye
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the dead of the night
That keeps me hanging on, waiting for the end

Just that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

I watch the street, I watch the radio
I don't need to turn it on
Another friend comes by and tries to say hello
Another weekend's almost gone
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the depth of the night
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end

It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

The time is flying fast, and I don't care
To spend another night alone
I want to see you, but I don't know where
Till then I'm walking on my own
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the depth of the night
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end

It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

That sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

Sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery



[Verse 1]
The sun is rising in the sky
Here we're waiting, standing by
Round in circles, round and round
Pulse is racing, can't sit down
The noise of people fills the air
Search for silence goes nowhere
Time just passes, starts to rain
I look at you and I feel your pain

[Chorus]
Day after day watching it grow, counting the time
In each and every way the pleasure is mine
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times
The farther we reach, the farther we see
The farther we go

[Chorus]
Time after time waiting for you, when will you come
Wanting to play the game we've begun
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times
The more we can give, the more we can keep
The more there will be

[Verse 2]
Like the man said he was right
About something coming in the air tonight
Well if it's coming, let it be now
I feel it's close, I just know somehow
I can't hold on much longer
My head is filled with wonder
But if these things don't come to pass
I'll bring you water and fill your glass

[Chorus]
Everyday the stronger it grows, it's easy to see
Getting to feel how good it can be
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times
The more that we teach, the better we learn
The better we'll be

[Outro][x4]
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times



How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh, Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Now Take a look at me now
'Cause that's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take
Take a look at me now



[Chorus 1]
Seems I've lingered too long in the darkness
Unlock the door, turn the light on and wait
I should know better than to rest on a promise
But this body before you has seen too much pain

[Chorus 2]
Take me down, take me down to the water
Take my hand, learn me all I should know
Here I am, I'm waiting for you
Just give me a sign, oh please don't fail me now

[Verse 1]
It's at this time we feel the emotion
Nothing is wasted, nothing is lost
I'm sure that I've been here before sometime
Some bridges are reached but never are crossed

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Don't fail me now
'cos it's out of my control
I'm coming with you
I'm right beside you
Oh feet don't fail me now

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]



[Verse 1]
Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm

[Refrain 1]
So, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Seems so long I've been waiting
Still don't know what for
There's no point in escaping
I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off the light

[Refrain 2]
But, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

[Chorus]
So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

[Verse 3]
Take that look of worry
Mine's an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight
And sleeping when it's night
I've got no far horizons
I don't wish upon a star
They don't think that I listen
Oh, but I know who they are

[Refrain 3]
And, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

[Chorus]
So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh Lord

[Bridge]
Well I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you, but I don't remember

[Outro]
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember...



[Verse 1]
Take that look of worry, I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing so I find out what I can
There's a fire that's been burning right outside my door
I can't see but I feel it, and it helps to keep me warm
So I, I don't mind, no I, I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Seems so long I've been waiting, still don't know what for
There's no point escaping, I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you, I don't like to go outside
They can't turn off my feelings like they're turning off a light
But I, I don't mind, no I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind, no I, I don't mind

[Hook]
So take, take me home
Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
Cause I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

[Verse 3]
Take that look of worry, mine's an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight and sleeping when it's night
I've got no far horizons, I don't wish upon a star
They don't think that I listen, oh but I know who they are
And I, I don't mind, no I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind, no I, I don't mind

[Hook]
So take, take me home
Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
Cause I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you



[Verse 1]
Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see it, but I feel it
And it helps me keep me warm
But I-I don't mind
No, I-I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Sweeps along life and waiting
Still don't know what for
Let's go boy, escaping
I don't worry anymore!
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they turning off the lights
But I-I don't mind
No, I-I don't mind
No, I-I don't mind
Oooh, I-I don't mind

[Hook]

Take that look of worry
Mine's an ordinary life
Working in it's daylight
And sleeping when it's night

I don't wish upon a star
They don't think I listen
But I know who they are!
But I, I don't mind

[Verse 1]
I know you're leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while
We all must feel heartache sometime
Right now, right now, now, I'm feeling mine

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child wrapped in a cradle
Let me know joy before I grieve
Just once more, darling, before you leave

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while
I'm losing you and my happiness
My life is over, I must confess

[Verse 3]
I'll never, never see your smiling face no more
I'll never, never hear your knock on my door
Before you leave me, leave me behind
Please let me feel happy just one more time

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, and rock me, rock me a little while

[Verse 4]
I said I never wouldn't beg, I said I wouldn't plead
Here I am, baby, begging you please
Baby, baby, please, baby, baby, please

[Outro]
Baby, take me in your arms
Come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling



[Verse 1]
If you see the light on in the window of my room
I'll be looking out though the shades are drawn
If you should hear someone quietly calling out for your hair
Don't be alarmed it might just be me

[Chorus]
Take me with you, take me there
I'll go with you anywhere
Show me all the things you know
Are you with me, are you there
I'll be with you everywhere
Show me all the things you know, you know, you know, you know

[Verse 2]
The sun always seems to shine on the other side of the mountain
The water is clearer on the other side of the hill
All that water comes to me, ooh as i lay down
Where i am is where i should be

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm holding them close to me
All those things i learned
But there's no questions and answers
So we watch the candle burn, on and on

[Verse 3]
So the candle burns all night, burns so bright until morning
When i wake i find myself alone
So if you see me - are you here? - hear someone cry, calling out
Rescue me and take me home - take me home

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Please take me, show me
Just take me, show me[x4]



Oh, no, not this confused again
Oh, no not the same mistakes again
You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard

Why can't you see what's going on?
I know you'd never admit
You would ever be to blame
Everything's a game to you
The old days are gone
And they're better left alone
I cannot help you
It's much too late

Oh, no, not this confused again
Oh, no not the same mistakes again
You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard

There's always a reason why it happened
You never never did anything wrong, but it
It just seem to fall apart
But you're taking it all too hard

Now that it's dark, all of your fears
Like shadows creeping around
You're much too scared to look down
And it's lonely out on your own
The old days are gone
And they're better left alone
But I still miss you
I keep it to myself

Oh, no, not this confused again
Oh, no not the same mistakes again
You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard

Oh, no, not this confused again
Oh, no not the same mistakes again
You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard

You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard

Oh, no, not this confused again
Oh, no not the same mistakes again
You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard

Oh, no, not this confused again
Oh, no not the same mistakes again
You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard



I wanna talk about my baby, yeah, yeah
With her pretty smile, yeah, yeah
She's 'bout to drive me crazy, yeah, yeah
Makes my heart beat wild

So everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

For her, I'd make any sacrifice

So everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And when she walks that walk
I can't help but feel that she's for real
And when she talks that talk
I can't quite explain just how I feel
Talking about my baby

I want to talk about my baby, yeah, yeah
To me, she's everything, yeah, yeah
She might fuss and call me lazy
But to her, I'm still the king

So everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Talking about my baby
You know we're talking about my baby

No one else but me

My baby and me
She's my baby, oh
[Incomprehensible]



[Verse 1]

To me she's everything, yeah yeah
She might fuss and called you lazy
But to her I'm still the king

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
A modern man with an old-fashioned heart
One look at her and I fell apart
I was always the one playing it cool
I got caught in the act, now there is no turning back

[Chorus]
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got caught up, bought up, strangled, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love

[Verse 2]
A long black dress and the call of the wild
I was a fool to think she was just a child
Out of my mind, out of control
Knew that feeling too well, tried to run but I fell

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I never meant to feel this way
Now I always want to stay

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love



Tearing and breaking down
Tearing my heart
Tearing and breaking down
Tearing my heart

(Tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
There goes my heart again
(Tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
Watch my heart fly away

All the love that I have ever known
Came from the sweetest of hearts
Every time I was looking for love
I found it in you

(Tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
There goes my heart again
(Tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
Watch my heart fly away

All the tears you found in your eyes
I know that they were mine
All the love you were trying to disguise
I never could desert

(Tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
There goes my heart again

(Tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
Watch my heart fly away

Saw that look in the eyes and I felt so sorry for myself
I could've cried
Heard you saying goodbye and you know it felt so strange
Cause I know we'd tried

(With all the tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
There goes my heart again
(Tearing and breaking down)
(Tearing my heart)
I can watch it fly away

Tearing and breaking down
Tearing my heart
All the tearing and breaking down
(Tearing my heart)
There goes my heart again

Tearing and breaking down
Tearing my heart
Tearing and breaking down
(Tearing my heart)
Watch my heart fly away, fly away, fly again

Tearing and breaking down
Tearing my heart



Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Now honey that's quite a different subject

But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
'Cause really I'm sad, sad, sad, oh I'm sadder than sad
Darling I'm hurtin and I want you so bad
Like a clown I appear to be glad ooh yeah

[Chorus]
Well they're some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
And honey to shield my pride I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
'Cause I need to go, oh I need you so
Look I'm hurt and I want you to know
For others I put on a show

[Chorus]
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my surface hid
Smiling in the crowd I try
But in a lonely room I cry
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around, oh yeah, baby baby

Now if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care
The tears of a clown
Yeah the tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh baby baby



[Verse 1]
Is she somewhere in the city?
Is she somewhere in this town?
What's her name?
What does she look like?
Is she fun to be around?
Does she make you feel like I did?
Oh, so long ago

[Chorus]
I wanna hear it from you
Tell me that it's over
Let me hear it from you
Tell me that it's over
I wanna hear it from you

[Verse 2]
First you look at me, with anger in your eyes
Then you look at me with spite
That's if you look at me at all
That's how I'm looking at you tonight
You tell me that love's a drag for you
But when the lights go out, you panic

[Chorus]
I wanna hear it from you
Tell me that it's over
Let me hear it from you
Tell me that it's over
I wanna hear it from you

I know I must be some kind of fool
To be in love with you
To be in love with you
Tell me that it's over
Let me hear it from you
Tell me that it's over
I wanna hear it from you



Mothers crying in the street
Children dying at their feet, tell me why
People starving everywhere there's too much food but none to spare, tell me why

Can you see that shaft of sunlight
Can you see it in my eyes
I can feel the fire that's burning
Anger and hope so deep
So deep within my heart
Before my eyes
For some it seems to late
It seems there's no-one listening

People sleeping in the streets
No roof above no food to eat, tell me why
See the questions in their eyes
Listen to their childrens cries
Tell me why

If there's a God, is he watching
Can he give a ray of hope
So much pain so much sorrow
Tell me what does he see
When he looks at you
When he looks at me
What would he say
It seems there's no-one listening

Who would think it still could happen
Even in this time and place
Politicians, they may save themselves
But they won't save their face
Just hope against hope
It's not to late

You say there's nothing you can do
Is there one rule for them and one for you
Tell me why

Listen can you see that shaft of sunlight
Can you see it in my eyes
I can feel the fire that's burning
Anger and hope so deep
So deep within my heart
Before my eyes
For some it's to late
It seems there's no-one listening

Hurry for me, hurry for me, they cry



[Chorus 1]
I want to testify, testify my love for you
I'm here to testify, testify my love for you
And I will do, all that I can do for you
Together, we will be together
Come on testify, testify your love for me
Testify, testify your love for me
You could be all the things you want to be
And together, we will be together

[Chorus 2]
Every heart that's ever been broken (prayer, prayer)
Knows these things must not go unspoken (prayer, prayer)
Giving yourself, giving each other (prayer, prayer)
The strength to lean on one another (prayer, prayer)
I'll be there for you (prayer, prayer)
You'll be here for me (prayer, prayer)

[Chorus 1]
That is why I want to testify, testify my faith in you
Come on and testify, testify your trust in me
We can be all the things we want to be
And together, we can do it together

[Chorus 2]
Every heart that's ever been broken (prayer, prayer)
Knows these things must not go unspoken (prayer, prayer)
Giving yourself, giving each other (prayer, prayer)
The strength to lean on one another (prayer, prayer)
I'll be there for you (prayer, prayer)
You'll be here for me (prayer, prayer)
(Prayer, prayer)

[Chorus 1]
I want to testify, testify my love for you
I'm here to testify, testify my love for you
And I will do, all that I can do for you
Together, we will always be together
I want to testify, my love for you (testify)
Yes, I want to testify, (testify)
Testify my love for you (testify)
I will do (testify)
All that I can do for you (I wanna testify)
Together, we will always be
Together
I wanna testify
Testify
I wanna testify
I wanna testify
I wanna testify
(I wanna) testify, testify...
(Together) Together, we will be (together)
Together for ever
Testify, testify
Testify, testify...



{Intro}

Just as I thought, it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
Its always the same, its just a shame, that's all

I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black, when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame, and that's all

I could leave, but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Turning me on, turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time

Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time

I could leave, but I won't go
But it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, its just a shame, that's all

Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end

{Bridge}

I could leave but I won't go

There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end

I could leave but I won't go
It would be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

So why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, its just a shame, that's all

But I love you, more then I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together' til the end

But just as I thought it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Well I could say day, and you'd say night
You tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all



[Verse 1]
Well I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so patiently
Out of the blue you call
You're leaving him to be with me now

[Chorus]
Now maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong
Oh, I gotta know now
I'll take what you got, so you'd better hold on
You'd better believe it
Cause that's how I feel when I'm in your arms
That's how I feel when I'm with you
You make me feel like never before
That's how I feel when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
He doesn't treat you good
He doesn't say the things that I say
So when he turns around
You're going to stab him in the back and then walk away

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You've been away too long
And now you're coming home
But I won't believe it until
I'm holding you tight, tight, tight tonight

[Chorus]

[Outro]
That's how I feel when I'm in your arms
(That's how I feel when I'm with you) ooh, yeah
That's how I feel when I'm in your arms
That's how I feel when I'm with you[x2]



[Chorus 1]
All day long he was fighting for you
And he didn't even know your name
Young men come and young men go
But life goes on just the same

[Chorus 2]
And I don't know why
Why do we keep holding on
I don't know why
Pretending to be oh so strong
Oh why
Is there something I don't know
Or something very wrong, with you and me
Or maybe

[Verse 1]
That's the way it is, there's nothing I can do
That's just the way it is
They've been waiting for word to come down
They've been waiting for you night and day
They won't wait any longer for you
It may already be too late

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Thats the way it is
Just the way it is

[Verse 2]
You see the dying, you feel the pain
What have you got to say
If we agree that we can disagree
We could stop all of this today
It's been your life for as long as you can remember
But you cannot fight no more
You must want to look your son in the eyes
When he asks you what you did it for

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]



[Verse 1]
I remember the night you weren't at home
(had to work late is what I heard)
That's what you said
I can never forget the way it felt
You needed some time to work it out

[Chorus 1]
That's what you said
And now I feel a fool

[Chorus 2]
'cos late at night I call your name
I'm wondering what for
'cos I've seen those other guys
Sniffing around your door

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened to the words
'lovers for all eternity?
That's what you said
I was your Romeo, you were my Juliet
Eternally

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
'cos late at night I hear your voice
Calling out my name
Oh I know it's just a dream
But every night's the same

[Chorus 3]
I carried a torch for you, through the thick and thin
You know it don't seem right that I won't see you again
No no

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 4]
I thought your friends all liked me
I thought I fitted in just right
That's what you said
Soon I'll be gone and you'll be free
You can go find the things that you want
That's what you said
And I won't feel a fool

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
What for?



[Verse 1]
Along the Forest Road, there's hundreds of cars - luxury cars
Each has got its load of convertible bars, cutlery cars - superscars!
For today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
'Cause they disagree on a gangland boundary
They disagree on a gangland boundary

There's Willy Wright and his boys -
One helluva noise, that's Billy's boys!
With fully-fashioned bugs, that's Little John's thugs
The Barking Slugs - supersmugs!
For today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
Yes, these Christian soldiers fight to protect the poor
East end heroes got to score in...

[Chorus]
The Battle of Epping Forest
Yes it's the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
And you ain't seen nothing like it
No, you ain't seen nothing like it
Not since the Civil War

[Bridge 1]
Coming over the hill are the boys of Bill
And Johnny's lads stand very still
With the thumpire's shout, they all start to clout
- There's no guns in this gentleman's bout
Georgie moves in on the outside left
With a chain flying 'round his head;
And Harold Demure, from Art Literature
Nips up the nearest tree
(Here come the cavalry!)

Amidst the battle roar
Accountants keep the score: 10-4
They've never been alone, after getting a radiophone
The bluebells are ringing for Sweetmeal Sam, real ham
Handing out bread and jam just like any picnic
Picnic - Picnic - Picnic

[Verse 2]
It's 5 to 4 on William Wright; he made his pile on Derby night
When Billy was a kid, walking the streets
The other kids hid - so they did!
And now, after working hard in security trade, he's got it made
The shops that need aid are those that haven't paid

"I'll do my double-show quick!"
Said Mick the Prick, fresh out the nick
"I sell cheap holiday. The minute they leave
And a visit I pay - does it pay!"
And his friend, Liquid Len by name
Of Wine, Women and Wandsworth fame
Said "I'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!
I'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!"
Got me framed

[Bridge 2]
They called me the Reverend when I entered the Church unstained
My employers have changed but the name has remained

It all began when I went on a tour
Hoping to find some furniture
Followed a sign saying "Beautiful Chest"
It led to a lady who showed me her best
She was taken by surprise when I quickly closed my eyes
So she rang the bell and quick as hell
Bob the Nob came out on his job
To see what the trouble was
"Louise, is the Reverend hard to please?"
"You're telling me!"
"Perhaps, sir, if it's not too late
We could interest you in our old-fashioned Staffordshire plate?"

"Oh no, not me, I'm a man of repute."
But the Devil caught hold of my soul and a voice called out "Shoot!"

To save my steeple, I visited people;
For this I'd gone when I met Little John
His name came, I understood
When the judge said "You are a robbing hood."
He told me of his strange foundation
Conceived in sight of the Woodstock nation
He'd had to hide his reputation
When poor, 'twas salvation from door to door
But now, with a pin-up guru every week
It was Love, Peace & Truth Incorporated for all who seek

He employed me as a karma-ma-mechanic, with overall charms
His hands were then fit to receive, receive alms

[Chorus]
That's why we're in the Battle of Epping Forest
Yes it's the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
We guard your souls for peanuts
And we guard your shops and houses
For just a little more, just a little more

[Bridge 1]
In with a left hook is the Bethnal Green Butcher
But he's countered on the right by Mick's chain-gang fight
And Liquid Len with his smashed bottle men
Is lobbing Bob the Nob across the gob
With his kisser in a mess, Bob seems under stress
But Jones the Jug hits Len right in the mug;
And Harold Demure, who's still not quite sure
Fires acorns from out of his sling
(Here come the cavalry!)

Up, up above the crowd
Inside their Silver Cloud, done proud
The bold and brazen brass, seen darkly through the glass
The butler's got jam on his Rolls; Roy doles out the lot
With tea from a silver pot just like any picnic
Picnic - Picnic - Picnic

[Outro]
Along the Forest Road, it's the end of the day
And the Clouds roll away
Each has got its load - they'll come out for the count
At the break-in of day
When the limos return for their final review, it's all thru
- all they can see is the morning goo

"There's no-one left alive - must be a draw."
So the Blackcap Barons toss a coin to settle the score



[I. In The Flesh?]

So 'ya
Thought 'ya
Might like to
Go to the show

To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind this cold eyes?
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

Lights...
Roll the sound effects...
Action...
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)

[II. Carry On Wayward Son]

[Instrumental]

[III. Bohemian Rhapsody]

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

[IV. Loving, Touching, Squeezing]

You make me weep
And wanna die
Just when
You said we'd try
Loving, touching, squeezing
Each other

When I'm alone
Oh by myself
You're out
With someone else
Loving, touching, squeezing
Each other

You're tearing me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearing me apart
Oh what can I say?
You're tearing me apart

It won't be long, no
Until you're alone
When you're lover
Oh he hasn't come home
Because he's loving, oh he's touching, he's squeezing
Another

He's tearing you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearing you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
'Cause he's loving, touching, another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry

[V. Cruise Control]


[Instrumental]

[VI. Turn It On Again]

Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on again



[Instrumental]



At the top of the stairs, there's hundreds of people
Running around to all the doors
They try to find, find themselves an audience;
Their deductions need applause

The rich man stands in front of me
The poor man behind my back
They believe they can control the game
But the juggler holds another pack

I need someone to believe in, someone to trust
I need someone to believe in, someone to trust

I'd rather trust a countryman than a town man
You can judge by his eyes, take a look if you can
He'll smile through his guard
Survival trains hard
I'd rather trust a man who works with his hands
He looks at you once, you know he understands
Don't need any shield
When you're out in the field

But down here
I'm so alone with my fear
With everything that I hear
And every single door, that I've walked through
Brings me back, back here again
I've got to find my own way

The priest and the magician
Singing all the chants that they have ever heard;
And they're all calling out my name
Even academics, searching printed word

My father to the left of me
My mother to the right
Like everyone else they're pointing
But nowhere feels quite right

And I need someone to believe in, someone to trust
I need someone to believe in, someone to trust

I'd rather trust a man who doesn't shout what he's found
There's no need to sell if you're homeward bound
If I choose a side
He won't take me for a ride

Back inside
This chamber of so many doors;
I've nowhere, nowhere to hide
I'd give you all of my dreams, if you'd help me
Find a door
That doesn't lead me back again
Take me away



[Verse 1]
Home from work, our Juliet
Clears her morning meal
She dabs her skin with pretty smells
Concealing to appeal
"I will make my bed"
She said, but turned to go
Can she be late for her cinema show?
Cinema show

[Verse 2]
Romeo locks his basement flat
And scurries up the stair
With head held high and floral tie
A weekend millionaire
I will make my bed
With her tonight, he cries
Can he fail armed with his chocolate surprise?

[Bridge]
Take a little trip back with father Tiresias
Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through
I have crossed between the poles, for me there's no mystery
Once a man, like the sea I raged
Once a woman, like the earth I gave
But there is in fact more earth than sea

[Interlude: Flute & oboe / Vocal harmonies]

[Bridge]
Take a little trip back with father Tiresias
Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through
I have crossed between the poles, for me there's no mystery
Once a man, like the sea I raged
Once a woman, like the earth I gave
But there is in fact more earth than sea

[Instrumental interlude: Synthesizer solo]



[1 - The Arrival]
Bubbity-bup

I wandered lonely as a cloud
Till I came upon this dirty street
I've never seen a stranger crowd
Slubberdegullions on squeaky feet

Continually pacing
With nonchalant embracing
Each orifice disgracing
One facing me moves to say "Hellay"

His skin's all covered in slimy lumps
With lips that slide across each chin
His twisted limbs like rubber stumps
Are waved in welcome, say "Please join in"

My grip must be flipping
'Cos his handshake keeps slipping
My hopes keep on dipping
And his lips keep on smiling all the time

'We, like you, have tasted love
Don't be alarmed at what you see
You yourself are just the same
As what you see in me'

'Me? Like you? Like that?'
'You better watch it, son
Your sentence has only just begun
You better run and join your brother John'

[2 - A Visit to the Doktor]
'You're in the colony of Slippermen
There's no who? Why? What? Or when?
You get out if you've got the gripe
To see Doktor Dyper, reformed sniper
He'll whip off your windscreen wiper'

John and I are able
To face the Doktor and his marble table
He said, "Understand Rael, that's the end of your tail"
'Don't delay, dock the dick'
I watch his countdown timer tick

[3 - The Raven]
He places the number into a tube
It's a yellow plastic 'Shoobedoobe'
It says, "Though your fingers may tickle
You'll be safe in our pickle"
Suddenly, black cloud come down from the sky
It's a super sized black bird that sure can fly

The raven brings on darkness and night
He flies right down, gives me one hell of a fright
He take the tube right out of my hands
Man, I got to find out where that black bird lands

'Look here John, I got to run
I need you now, you going to come?'
He says to me, "Now can't you see
Where the raven flies there's jeopardy

"We've been cured on the couch
Now you're sick with your grouch
I'll not risk my honey pouch
Which my slouch will wear slung very low"

He walks away and leaves me once again
Even though I never learn
I'd hoped he'd show just some concern

Some concern, oh-oh
Some concern

I'm in the agony of slipper pain
I pray my undercarriage will sustain
The chase is on, the pace is hot
But I'm running so very hard with everything that I've got

He leads me down an underpass
Though it narrows, he still flies very fast
When the tunnel stops
Catch sight of the tube, just as it drops

I'm on top of a bank too steep to climb
I see it hit the water just in time

To watch it float away
Watch it float away
Watch it float away
Ache
Make
Lake
Slake
Wake
Snake



From a dense forest of tall, dark, pinewood
Mount Ida rises like an island
Within a hidden cave, nymphs had kept a child;
Hermaphroditus, son of gods, so afraid of their love

As the dawn creeps up the sky
The hunter caught sight of a doe
In desire for conquest
He found himself within a glade he'd not beheld before

Hermaphroditus:
"Where are you my father
Give wisdom to your son"

(Narrator:
"Then he could go no further
Now lost, The boy was guided by the sun")

And as his strength began to fail
He saw a shimmering lake
A shadow in the dark green depths
Disturbed the strange tranquility

Salmacis:
"The waters are disturbed
Some creature has been stirred"

(Narrator:
"The waters are disturbed
The naiad queen Salmacis has been stirred")

As he rushed to quench his thirst
A fountain spring appeared before him
And as his heated breath brushed through the cool mist
A liquid voice called, "Son of gods, drink from my spring"

The water tasted strangely sweet
Behind him the voice called again
He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone
And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake

Salmacis:
"We shall be one
We shall be joined as one"

(Narrator:
"She wanted them as one
Yet he had no desire to be one")

Hermaphroditus: "Away from me cold-blooded woman
Your thirst is not mine"
Salmacis: "Nothing will cause us to part
Hear me O Gods"

Unearthly calm descended from the sky
And then their flesh and bones were strangely merged
Forever to be joined as one

The creature crawled into the lake
A fading voice was heard:
"And I beg, that all who touch this spring
May share my fate"


Salmacis:
"We are the one
We are the one"

(Narrator:
"The two are now made one
Demi-god and nymph are now made one")

Both had given everything they had
A lover's dream had been fulfilled at last
Forever still beneath the lake



"It's the last great adventure left to mankind"
Screams a drooping lady
Offering her dreamdolls at less than extortionate prices
And as the notes and coins are taken out
I'm taken in, to the factory floor

For the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse

Got people stocked in every shade
Must be doing well with trade
Stamped, addressed, in odd fatality
That evens out their personality
With profit potential marked by a sign
I can recognise some of the production line
No bite at all in labour bondage
Just wrinkled wrappers or human bandage

The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
It's the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse

The hall runs like clockwork
Their hands mark out the time
Empty in their fullness
Like a frozen pantomime
Everyone's a sales representative
Wearing slogans in their shrine
Dishing out failsafe superlative
Brother John is No. 9

For the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
It's the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse

The decor on the ceiling
Has planned out their future day
I see no sign of free will
So I guess I'll have to pay
Pay my way
For the Grand Parade
For the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse



And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Early morning Manhattan
Ocean winds blow on the land
The Movie-Palace is now undone
The all-night watchmen have had their fun
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show
It's the same old ending - time to go
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Nightime's flyers feel their pains
Drugstore takes down the chains
Metal motion comes in bursts
But the gas station can quench that thirst
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out of the subway
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

The lamb seems right out of place
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face
Somehow it's lying there
Brings a stillness to the air
Though man-made light, at night is very bright
There's no whitewash victim
As the neons dim, to the coat of white
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Suzanne tired her work all done
Thinks money-honey-be on-neon
Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn
Wonder women you can draw your blind!
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind
I'm Rael!
Something inside me has just begun
Lord knows what I have done
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
On Broadway ...
They say the lights are always bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air



[A1]
The scent grows richer; he knows he must be near
He finds a long passageway lit by chandelier
Each step he takes, the perfumes change
From familiar fragrance to flavours strange
A magnificent chamber meets his eye

[A2]
Inside, a long rose-water pool is shrouded by fine mist
Stepping in the moist silence
With a warm breeze he's gently kissed
Thinking he is quite alone
He enters the room as if it were his own
But ripples on the sweet pink water reveal some company unthought of

[B1]
Rael stands astonished doubting his sight
Struck by beauty, gripped in fright
Three vermilion snakes of female face
The smallest motion, filled with grace

[C1]
Muted melodies fill the echoing hall
But there is no sign of warning in the siren's call
"Rael, welcome! We are the Lamia of the pool
We have been waiting for our waters to bring you cool”

[Synthesizer interlude]

[A3]
Putting fear beside him
He trusts in beauty blind
He slips into the nectar
Leaving his shredded clothes behind

With their tongues, they test-taste and judge
All that is mine
They move in a series of caresses that glide up and down my spine

[A4]
As they nibble the fruit of my flesh
I feel no pain
Only a magic that a name would stain

With the first drop of my blood in their veins
Their faces are convulsed in mortal pains
The fairest cries, “We all have loved you, Rael"

[B2]
Each empty snake-like body floats
Silent sorrow in empty boats
A sickly sourness fills the room
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom

[C2]
Looking for motion I know I will not find
I stroke the curls now turning pale in which I'd lain entwined

Oh lamia, your flesh that remains I will take as my food
It is the scent of garlic that lingers on my chocolate fingers

[Longer synthesizer interlude]

[Outro]
Looking behind me
The water turns icy-blue
The lights are dimmed and once again the stage is set for you

[Guitar solo]



[Verse 1]
I was lying awake last night, waiting for your call
But if the rumours are true, that won't bother you at all
I'm trying hard to understand
What it takes to be your man
Now I don't have to wonder anymore

[Chorus]
Least you can do is say you're sorry
Least you can do is give me back my heart
Just give me back my heart

[Verse 2]
Seems living in hope was wrong those years I was away
Thinking your letters, I never received, had gone astray
You said you'd always be there for me
Like a fool I thought you'd be
Now I don't know what I was thinking at all

[Chorus]
But the least you can do is say you're sorry girl
Least you can do is give me back my heart
I won't come around no more
You won't find me standing outside your door
Least you can do is tell me why, tell me why

[Bridge]
I won't be your fool anymore
There's no need to be cruel anymore

[Chorus]
Least you can do is say you're sorry girl
The least you can do is give me back my heart
But the least you can do is say you're sorry girl
Least you can do is give me back my heart
(so I could move on with my life)

But the least you can do is say you're sorry girl
(Is there so much to ask?)
Least you can do is give me back my heart
Give me back my heart



There's an angel standing in the sun

There's an angel standing in the sun
Free to get back home



[Verse 1]
They come from miles around just to hear him play
He's on the same street corner almost every day
And there's always a crowd wherever he goes
And when he blows his horn, well everybody knows

[Chorus]
I only want to see him play
All the girls 'n' boys they wanna see him play
Nobody else they wanna see him play
And he brings a tear to the eye
He'll make you smile of make you cry
And nobody asks him why
Cause they just wanna see him play

[Verse 2]
They come from every way, every night
He's got a band so out there, it's outta sight
And the boys in the dancehall are rocking in the aisle
The girls up front - they wanna see him smile

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeah, he's the man with the horn
Ooh they wanna see him play
Yeah, he's the man with the horn
Ooh they wanna see him play
Yeah, he's the man with the horn
You know they want to see him, they wanna see him
They wanna, they want to , they wanna see him play
(Play it, don)

[Verse 3]
Ah, station to station, coast to coast
Well you can hear all his records on the radio
He makes every evening feel like saturday night
And if you're happy or sad he'll make the feeling right

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes, you know they wanna see him, they wanna see him
Chow, they know they wanna see him, they wanna see him
They want to , they wanna, they wanna see him play
They want to see him play, play, play, play
Oh, all the girls and boys want to see him play
All the girls and boys want to see him play
All the girls and boys



[Chorus: Stefanee Morrison]
My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed?
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Yo, how could one ever know that I'm forgiven
This bitterness and resentment
Block the flow of God's blessings in life
You know it's stressing me, right?
Holding on in the hurt, (?) poison, them emotional scars
And locked doors that shouldn't be open
The lines is too thin like coke and cheap gin
Like ghettos that turn good kids into gunmen, I'm wondering
If all my niggas fall anything
How the fuck we gon' stand for something?
Impossible's nothing, when ya fucking with a nigga with a attitude
100 Miles and Runnin', like (?) and Cube
Like Jesus to Judas
The betrayal is nothing short of ruthless, I'll die before I pretend
I had the power to exorcise, selfish all over (?)
When I am, tempted to see the darker side of my life
I reframe, from entering into traps of temptation
But sometimes I gotta ask myself this question, Lord

[Chorus: Stefanee Morrison]
My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed?
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

[Verse 2: Ja Rule (Stefanee Morrison)]
My mind is playing tricks like, look but don't touch
Touch but don't taste, taste but don't swallow
No one's promised tomorrow
But pray for the days to follow, I'm so confused to be honest
Is my faith in the almighty or the almighty dollar?
The father, the son
A hundred to one, the bullet, the gun
Kill somebody innocently that ya love
In my lifetime I sold a whole lot of drugs
And done even more, to ease the pain, the love's gone
They say never say never, I say never get better
(?) back, then back together
Where there's pain there's pleasure
Where there's pleasure there's hate
No one hated me more than myself, it's hard to relate
To someone you know so well, or so I thought
Sometimes I look in the mirror, and see someone else
There's two of me, but I'm by myself
Ready to die, am I losing my mind?
Then look in my eyes, and my question to God
(My life, my love, is it in vain?)
All reflections of pain, that's reluctant to change
I'm transparent to love, I don't see the love in
In reflection within I'm blind, then I close my eyes and
Thank the Lord for every day that I rise
My heart, my soul, my mind
As long as I'm breathing, I'M ALIVE, the reason, I SURVIVE
The pain throughout my life, it's called love

[Bridge: Ja Rule (Stefanee Morrison)]
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is

[Chorus: Stefanee Morrison]
My life, my love
Is it in vain or am I ashamed?
Of what I came from or what I might become?
Some say that love is pain, some believe pain is love
My heart, my soul's yearning for your love's pain
You need to get you some
Come on and get you some
Some people say love is pain
Some believe that pain is love

[Outro: Ja Rule (Stefanee Morrison)]
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is
Love is, love is
Pain is, pain is



Play me Old King Cole
That I may join with you
All your hearts now seem so far from me
It hardly seems to matter now

And the nurse will tell you lies
Of a kingdom beyond the skies
But I am lost within this half-world
It hardly seems to matter now

Play me my song
Here it comes again
Play me my song
Here it comes again

Just a little bit
Just a little bit more time
Time left to live out my life

Play me my song
Here it comes again
Play me my song
Here it comes again

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he
So he called for his pipe
And he called for his bowl
And he called for his fiddlers three

But the clock, tick-tock
On the mantelpiece -
And I want, and I feel, and I know
And I touch her warmth

She's a lady, she's got time
Brush back your hair
And let me get to know your face
She's a lady, she is mine
Brush back your hair
And let me get to know your flesh

I've been waiting here for so long
And all this time has passed me by
It doesn't seem to matter now
You stand there with your fixed expression
Casting doubt on all I have to say
Why don't you touch me, touch me
Why don't you touch me, touch me
Touch me now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now



[Verse]
So here we are together
Just you and me
Sitting side by side
Don't know why
With time just racing by
But i don't want to go
Well i don't know much about it
Cause all i am is what you see
In front of you
There's no more
Feels so close and yet so far
But i don't want to go
Here i am, take my hand
Here i am, please take my hand
I'd like to sit here with you if that's alright
If you don't mind i could sit and stare all night
Sit here waiting for you to hold me tight
It's sad but i know it's true
You see i know you well
You'd only laugh at me
And that would hurt me so
Just look at me here
You've got me pleading with you
But i don't want to go
Cause you know that i love you so
Yes you know that i love you so
Here I will be here love
For you love, i will always be here love
If you look real close
You'll see my heart is on my sleeve
And it'll be here waiting
Waiting for you, waiting for me
Someone once said that if you truly, truly believe
You can make things happen
Make things appear to be all that they seem
Tell me do you believe?
We'll find a hideaway
Together we'll find a way
Somewhere, somehow, we'll find some way
There must be somewhere
There must be someplace
We can find somewhere
Where they don't know my face
Believe me we can find it
Yes we can find it
Somewhere, there's a place for us
Somewhere, a time and a place for us
Somewhere



[Verse 1]
Turn and run!
Nothing can stop them
Around every river and canal their power is growing
Stamp them out!
We must destroy them
They infiltrate each city with their thick dark warning odour

[Chorus 1]
They are invincible
They seem immune to all our herbicidal battering

[Bridge 1]
Long ago in the Russian hills
A Victorian explorer found the regal Hogweed by a marsh
He captured it and brought it home

Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge
Royal beast did not forget
He came home to London
And made a present of the Hogweed to the Royal Gardens at Kew

[Verse 2]
Waste no time!
They are approaching
Hurry now, we must protect ourselves and find some shelter
Strike by night!
They are defenceless
They all need the sun to photosensitize their venom

[Chorus 2]
Still they're invincible
Still they're immune to all our herbicidal battering

[Bridge 2]
Fashionable country gentlemen had some cultivated wild gardens
In which they innocently planted the Giant Hogweed throughout the land

Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge
Royal beast did not forget
Soon they escaped, spreading their seed
Preparing for an onslaught, threatening the human race

[THE DANCE OF THE GIANT HOGWEED]

[Outro]
Mighty Hogweed is avenged
Human bodies soon will know our anger
Kill them with your Hogweed hairs

This is called "The Return of the Giant Hogweed"

Turn and run

[Verse 1]
The roof is leaking, and the wind is howling
Kids are crying 'cause the sheets are so cold
I woke this morning found my hands were frozen
I've tried to fix the fire, but you know, the damn thing's too old

[Verse 2]
It's been months now, since we heard from our Mary
I wonder if she ever made the coast
Well, she and her young man, they both moved out there
I sure hope they write, just to let us know

[Chorus]
And me, I'm getting stronger by the minute
My wife's expecting, but I hope she can wait
'Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
But spring'll soon be here, oh
Well I hope it's not late

[Verse 3]
Ma and Pa lived here, and theirs before them
They tried their hardest to make it a home
Seems so long now since they passed over
Hope my children'll try to make it their own

[Verse 4]
My roof is leaking and the wind is howling
The kids are crying 'cause the sheets are so cold
I woke this morning found my hands were frozen
Oh, I've tried to fix the fire, but you know, the damn thing's too old

[Chorus]
But me, oh, I'm getting stronger by the minute
My wife's expecting, but I hope she can wait
'Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
But spring'll soon be here, oh
God, I hope it's not late



[Verse 1]
When the daylight comes and I look across the room
I see you're gone
As the morning breaks and I reach to hold your hand
I can see, see I'm the only one
Well, your clothes are gone and your bags are packed
But the bed's still warm where you lay
Now I need your love to come shining through
To carry me, come carry me away

[Chorus]
If you choose a time, I'll catch the moon
I'll see you there
From wherever I am, wherever you are
We'll find somewhere
I see the same stars in the same sky
Shining down on you
I'll be looking up from wherever I am
And it's you I'll see if you're looking too

[Verse 2]
There'll be days that'll seem much longer
Some nights will seem so cold
And it's gotta come soon - please don't be too long
Don't be too long

[Chorus]

Miscellaneous
The Times Are A-Changin'
Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone -
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics
Who prophecise with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call -
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle
Outside and it's ragin' -
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticise
What you can't understand -
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now will
Later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past -
The order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'



[Verse 1]
Come gather around people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone

It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

The curse it is cast
The slow one now will
Later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'

[Verse 1]
Every little thing's been said about it
How does it apply to you?
Maybe I could learn to live without it
Where do you find, one of a kind
Playing for time the way you do?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll find love, the way you do
Maybe I'll find love, the way you do
Playing for time love, the way you do
The way you do, the way you do

[Verse 2]
Every other day I think about it
Do you remember when?
You said we'd never be without it
Where do you find, one of a kind
Playing for time the way you do?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll find love, the way you do
Maybe I'll find love, the way you do
Playing for time love, the way you do
The way you do, the way you do

[Verse 3]
Everybody says I'm mad to doubt it
And I believe it's true
Maybe I should learn to live without it
But, where do you find, one of a kind
Playing for time the way you do?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll find love, the way you do
Maybe I'll find love, the way you do
Playing for time love, the way you do
The way you do, the way you do



Some day, when I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you...
And the way you look tonight
Oh but you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my soul apart...
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
But you're lovely... Never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight



Some day, when I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
But you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my soul apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
But you're lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you, just the way you look tonight
But you're lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you, just the way you look
Just the way you look, just the way you look tonight



[Verse]
This love, this heart, these arms to hold
So tight to you, I won't let go
Can this be real, or just some dream that feels so true
I wish you love, I wish you more
You are all that I live for
I'll never hurt you believe me
My heart beats just for you
It only beats for you
I'll keep the fire alight for you
Can't think of nothing else, what can I do
This lonely heart of mine, it only beats for you
It only beats for you
You bring me peace, you make me smile
You give me strength and all the while
You ask for nothing, only love
And my heart beats just for you
It only beats for you
I'd say all these things to you
If you were here, but that's not going to be
Because you 're not here at all
There's only me
But I won't stop trying
I won't give up, I'll wait for you
Till you come back, it's all I can do
I'll be right here, I'm going nowhere without you
Give me the chance, just make the call
Just say the words, I'm waiting for
Just let this heart of mine show you
It only beats for you

[Outro]
Yes it only beats for you
It only beats for you
This love, this heart
These arms, they're only for you
This love, this heart
These arms, they're only for you
They're only for you



[Chorus]
It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love

[Bridge]
Well I wait in every day, just in case
You decide to call
And I can hardly wait, 'cos I never thought time could pass so slowly

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again, but now I know
It's you that I've been looking for
And day by day more and more
I know what you think, you've heard it before
Don't tell me I know
But this feeling inside my heart
You know I'm never letting go
Becouse I think that

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Words can only say so much
It's hard to express
The things you do to me
You're everything I could ever dreamed you'd be

[Chorus]

Lilac blossoms, just as sweet
Now my heart is shattered
If I bowled it down the street
Who's to say it mattered?
If there's one that rode away
What would I be missing?
Lips that taste of tears, they say
Are the best for kissing
Eyes that match the morning star
Seem a little brighter
Arms held out to darkness are
Usually whiter
Shall I bar the strolling guest
Bind my brow with willow
When, they say, the empty breast
Is the softer pillow?
That a heart falls tinkling down
Never think it ceases
Every likely lad in town
Gathers up the pieces
If there's one gone whistling by
Would I let it grieve me?
Let him wonder if I lie
Let him half believe me



It's never where you think you'll find it
The thing you think you're looking for
And it could take you all your lifetime
And still you'd never quite be sure
You could look everywhere
Because you know it's there
Somewhere beneath the sky
Too close and you'll get burned
But there's no lesson learned
Yet some people pass it by
You'll see the things different
When you look through my eyes
Things are different if you see what I see
Just look closely and you'll see through my eyes
It could be different, you'll see how it could be
If you can see
You may need help to find your way home
Those who brought you here have flown
The road you take is full of hope or sadness
The choice you make will be your own
You're not alone in there
Just say hello in there
'Cause there are many just like you
They'll help you find someway
To make it all the way
They'll tell you all you have to do
You'll see the things different
When you look through my eyes
Things are different if you see what I see
Just look closely and you'll see through my eyes
It could be different, you'll see how it could be
If you can see
No one warns you of the heartache
No one can hide you from the storm
But from the shadows there will come the sunshine
A place to dry and keep you warm
Though no one tells you how
Your heart's beating faster now
Getting stronger day by day
Suddenly it's clear
What you seek is near
It's what you learn along the way
It's never where you think you'll find it
The thing you think you're looking for
Well, it could take you all your lifetime
Still you'll never quite be sure
You'll find it
You'll find it
Just look closer
You'll find it
Look closer
It's there
You'll find it
You'll find it
Yes, you'll find it
You look closer
Look closer
Look closer
Look closer
You'll find it



Need I say I love you?
Need I say I care?
Need I say that emotions
Are something we don't share?

I don't want to be sitting here
Trying to convince you
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

We can not live together
We can not live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start

Every time that I look at you
I can see the future
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind?
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turnin' upside down

Throwing it all away

Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey...

We're throwing it all away

Just a throwing it all away

Just a throwing it all away



Need I say I love you?
Need I say I care?
Need I say that emotions
Are something we don't share?

I don't want to be sitting here
Trying to convince you
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

We can not live together
We can not live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start

Every time that I look at you
I can see the future
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind?
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turnin' upside down

Throwing it all away

Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey



[Chorus]
It's never where you think you'll find it
The thing you think you're looking for
It could take you all your lifetime
And still you'd never quite be sure

[Verse]
You could look everywhere
Because you know it's there
Somewhere beneath the sky
But too close and you'll get burned
There's no lesson learned
Yet some people pass it by
You'll see things different when you look thru my eyes
Things are different if you see what I see
Just look closely and you'll see thru my eyes
It could be different, you'll see how it could be
If you can see
You may need help to find your way home
Those who brought you here have flown
The road you take is full of hope or sadness
The choice you make will be your own
But you're not alone in there
Just say hello in there
COs there are many just like you
They'll help you find someway
To make it all the way
You'll see things different when you look thru my eyes
Things are different if you see what I see
Just look closely and you'll see thru my eyes
It could be different, you'll see how it could be

No one warns you of the heartache
No one can hide you from the storm

Your hearts beating faster now
Getting stronger day by day
Suddenly it's clear, what you seek is near
It's what you learn along the way

[Chorus]



[Chorus]
I can hear thru' these walls
I can hear it when they're fooling around
I can hear thru' these walls
And I hear every sign, every sound
I can hear thru' these walls
In the dark with the shades pulled down

[Bridge]
Every word that they say
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way

[Verse 1]
My favorite moment
Putting the glass up next to the wall
Imagination
Tho' I see nothing, I hear it all
Putting my sign up
Do not disturb me, speak or shout, inside out
Oh mind my clothes, they're all laid out

[Chorus]
I can see thru' my windows
I can see the girls and the boys
I can see thru' my windows
And I can imagine the noise
I can see thru' my windows
I can see them playing with toys

[Bridge]
Oh I hope it won't end
If I promise not to touch, just be a friend

[Verse 2]
Life is so lonely
I don't get high off just being me
I like pretending
Wanting to touch them, wanting to see
It's only normal
Creeping behind you, now don't shout, Because it's alright
They keep the windows locked and the door shut tight
Oo I'm feeling like I'm locked in a cage
No way in, no way out, and it gets so lonely
Am I really asking a lot
Just to reach out and touch somebody
Because when I look thru' my windows or open my door
I can feel it all around me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Every word that they say
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way

Ah yeah



[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd ever get tired of playing games
But I've been holding back for too long
Now the time has come to get it right
Now's the time to show them all that they're wrong

[Chorus]
'Cos they said thunder and they said lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice
Oh it feels alright

[Verse 2]
Never ever did believe in guiding lights
'Cos what you didn't hold, slipped away
Oh but there's a feeling deep down in my shoe
'Cos things look like they're going my way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I never ever did believe in a second chance
You get, just one crack of the whip, that's all
If you played the game, you got treated right
Oh but I'm not playing the game, no more

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd ever get tired of playing games
But I've been holding back for too long
Now the time has come to get it right
Now's the time to show them all that they're wrong

[Chorus]
'Cos they said thunder and they said lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels alright

[Verse 2]
I never ever did believe in guiding lights
'Cos what you didn't hold, slipped away
Oh but there's a feeling deep down in my shoes
'Cos things look like they're going my way

[Chorus 2]
'Cos they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, so nice
Oh it feels alright

Yeah
Oh

[Verse 3]
I never ever did believe in a second chance
You get, just one crack of the whip, that's all
If you played the game, you got treated right
Oh but I'm not playing the game, no more

[Chorus 2] (X3)
'Cos they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice



Never ask her age
Young at heart
She's living life from day to day
Blushing like a bride
Joining hands you watch her face in minutes
Slowly disappear
Moments take a year

I know time is a woman
I know she wears her body well
I see time is a lover
I feel her slip away
She never stays

Count them one by one
Seconds rolling round your heart
They tick away
Growin' old in style
She's the child who makes the world keep waiting
For a better place
Runnin' out of space

She never stays
No she never
No she never
Watch her slip away
She's a mystery, she's a mystery

Heaven sent you a gift
Don't you abuse it
She can take it away
Don't you lose it
If you start to believe every answer
She may take it away even faster



A carved oak table
Tells a tale
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room
To arbours cool

A time of valour, and legends born
A time when honour meant much more to a man than life
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong
Through lance and sword

Why, why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander
It seems because through time and space
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore

A dusty table
Musty smells
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey
That scars the panes

Gone the carving
And those who left their mark
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway
And the weak must die according to nature's law
As old as they

Why, why can we never be sure till we die
Or have killed for an answer
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe
That no race has been grander
It seems because through time and space
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore



[Omkvæd 1]
Sæt din lid til det, du virkelig tror på
To liv, et kærligt hjem
Find din vej, ha' hjertet med
Hvor skæbnen fører dig hen

[Vers 1]
Et lille urørt paradise
Et nyt mirakel er født
Et enkelt liv i ro og fred

[Omkvæd 2]
Gå forsigtigt gennem junglesandet
To liv, et kærligt hjem
Find din vej, ha' hjertet med
Hvor skæbnen fører dig hen

[Vers 2]
I ly af træernes grønne løv
Hvor kun ømhed trænger ind
Et enkelt liv i ro og fred

[Bro]
Løft nu blikket, løft jeres grej
I er hinandens styrke
Gør væggen høj, gør el-gen stærk
Et nyt liv begynder, men faren ligger på lur

[Instrumental solo]

[Kontraststykke]
Den mor, der mister, mangler ord
Og ingen ord kan bringe trøst
En drøm er knust, men der er håb

[Omkvæd 3]
Du hører nogen kalde på dig
To liv, et kærligt hjem
Find din vej, ha' hjertet med
Hvor skæbnen fører dig hen



[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying [2x]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, oh It is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is beginning, oh it is beginning

[Verse 2]
That love is all and love is ev'ryone
It is knowing, oh it is knowing
And ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, oh it is believing
So play the game, existence to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

[Outro]
Of the beginning [3x]

[Hidden Track "Over The Rainbow"]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that dreamed of once in a lullaby
Okay



[Verse 1]
I'm coming down
Coming down like a monkey
But it's alright
Like a load on your back that you can't see
Ooh, but it's alright
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, just let it go
Get it away from me

[Chorus]
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm going down
Going down, like a monkey, ooh
But it's alright
Try to pick yourself up
Carry that weight that you can't see
Don't you know it's alright
It's like a helter skelter
Going down and down, round and round
But just get it away from me, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
We're gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

[Verse 3]
I got some money in my pocket
About ready to burn
I don't remember where I got it
I gotta get it to you
So please answer the phone
'Cause I keep calling
But you're never home
What am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

[Bridge]
You keep telling me I've got everything
You say I've got everything I want
You keep telling me you're gonna help me
You're gonna help me, but you don't
But now I'm in too deep
You see it's got me so that I just can't sleep
Oh get me out of here
Please get me out of here
Just help me, I'll do anything, anything
If you'll just help, get me out of here

[Verse 4]
I'm coming down
Coming down like a monkey

Just get it away from me, oh

Hey listen guys
Take this advice, and remember always in life

Into each heart some tears must fall
And though we love and lose, we must stand tall
'Cause we all got to cry sometimes
I said, sigh sometimes
Pull yourself together
There's no use crying forever

Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
Well there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

My mother once told me something
And every word is true
Don't waste your time on a girl
Who does not love you
She'll only mislead you
Only grieve you
Don't worry about her
Just do without her

Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
Short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

Well, if the fish isn't on your line
Bait your hook and keep on trying
Well don't let her get you down
There's other girls around

Because there's too many fish in the sea
There's too many fish in the sea
There's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

I don't want nobody that don't want me
'Cause there's too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me, now
Too many fish in the sea
I don't need nobody that don't need me
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't love me, now
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me



The moon retreats behind a silver cloud
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth
And mystery replaces what thought we knew

To turn the stone, to turn the stone

The one dimension only shows one side
But do we see the same through different eyes
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope

To turn the stone, to turn the stone

Eternal sands of time shift endlessly
Behind a veil of motionless disguise
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need

To turn the stone, to turn the stone
To turn the stone, to turn the stone



[Verse 1: Kala & Phil Collins]
Oublie ton chagrin, surtout ne crains rien
Je prends en main ton destin, lorsque le danger te menacera
Je serai là avec toi

Tu es si fort, et si fragile
Viens dans mes bras je te ferai un nid
Ce lien qui nous lie ne cassera pas
Ne pleure pas je suis là

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
Car tu vis dans mon coeur
Oui tu vis dans mon coeur
Dès maintenant jusqu'à la Nuit des temps
Tu vis dans mon coeur
Qu'importe leurs discours
Tu vivras dans mon coeur toujours
Toujours

[Verse 1]
Come with me, I'll take you now
To a place that you fear
For no reason why
Your heart has turned away from me
And I will make you understand

[Chorus]
Everything will become clear to you
When you see things through
Another's eyes
Everything will become clear to you
Whatever's meant for you, you will find

[Verse 2]
Come with me, I'll take you there
To a place where you'll see
Everything you need to be the one
You need to be
And all of those things that you feared
Will disappear from you in time

[Chorus]
Everything will become clear to you
When you see things through
Another's eyes
Everything will become clear to you
Whatever's meant for you, you will find

[Verse 1]
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh i realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness, inside you
Can make you feel so small

[Chorus]
But i see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why i love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow

[Verse 2]
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When i last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know i'll be there

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So sad eyes
Discouraged now
Realize
When this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know i'll be there

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow [x4]



(One, two, three, four!)

All I need is a TV show, that and the radio
Down on my luck again, down on my luck again
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad, just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I, I...

You're just another face that I know from the TV show
I have known you for so very long, I feel you like a friend
Can't you do anything for me, can I touch you for a while
Can I meet you another day and we will fly away

I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad it's just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I...

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)

[Verse 1]
Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cause it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cause she's always there behind you, just to remind you

[Chorus]
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

[Verse 2]
Cause there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like i'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

[Chorus]
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

[Bridge]
She knows (she knows)
There will always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (she knows)
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, i'm always right there beside her

[Chorus]
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time [x3]



Well there was no reason to believe
She'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you're believin'
It's getting ya nowhere

And it teaches you to never give up
Don't look down, just look up
'Cause she's always there behind you
Just to remind you

Two hearts living in just one mind
You know it, two hearts living in just one mind

Well there was no easy way to
To understand it
'Cause there's so much of my life in her
And it's like I planned it

And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you, no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts living in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know it, two hearts living in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

Well she knows, there'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah she knows (she knows), no matter how far apart we are, she knows
I'm always right there beside her

We're two hearts living in just one mind
Beating together until the end of time
You know it, two hearts, but living in, living in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

You know it, two hearts living in just one mind
Just one mind, just one mind until the end of time
You know it, two hearts, but living in just one mind
Beating together forever till the end of time

[Intro]
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight

[Verse 1]
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true

[Chorus]
She says baby everything is alright
Uptight
Out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight
Clean out of sight

[Verse 2]
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I
I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
She says give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry

Is all right
I can win
Uptight
Because my hart is true

[Chorus]
She says baby everything is alright
Uptight
Out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight
Clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight
Clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight
Clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight



She packed her bags and dressed
Long before the sunrise
No one knew
She told them many times
About how she would teach them
And now it's time
Standing quietly by the door
Her face is numb with fear
She stops and then goes on
"Leave forever - it's now or never"

Quickly walking down the street
It's cold and grey, dawn's breaking
She don't mind (she don't mind)
Why she feels so grown up now
Her life is just beginning
She don't know (she don't know)
She's standing in the pouring rain
Her make-up's running down
She wonders now she's here
"Where will I go? Who do I know?"

Now, now she's not quite so sure
I may be wrong but home seems so much more friendly now
And they might worry but she doesn't want them to
Cos causing pain, that's not the thing that she set out to do

So she's back in bed before
Anyone can miss her
She feels good (she feels good)
Knowing the chance was there
Deciding not to take it
That's her choice (that's her choice)
She's still awake, her mum comes in
"Me and dad, we've had a chat
And we're sorry for the things we said
Please forgive us - you wouldn't leave us?"



Jane
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord, God made them all

Each little flow'r that opens
Each little bird that sings
He made their glowing colors
He made their tiny wings



[Intro]
This is your wake up call... young hearts be free

[Verse 1]
Get up, get on, get out about and shout it
Tell 'em all you're dressed and on your way
Oh there's absolutely no doubt about it

[Chorus 1]
This is your wake up call
You're going to miss it all

Am I the only one out there that's listening
Because it's such a lovely noise that I can hear
Eyes are opening up to all around them

[Chorus 1]
This is their wake up call
They're going to miss it all

[Chorus 2]
Can you feel what's happening here
Everything is changing all around you
It's in the air, electricity
Everybody, yes everybody's waking up
Good morning to you

[Verse 3]
You're not the only one out there who's running
But the man who's sitting next to you's asleep
So pick him up and shake him till he hears you

[Chorus 1]
This is his wake up call
He's going to miss it all

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4]
Those who've done all they can do sleep easy
Those that turn away, they sleep alone
But there's no doubt about it absolutely

[Chorus 1]
This is a wake up call
We 're going to miss it all[x2]

[Outro]
This is your wake up call[x3]
You're going to miss it
You're going to miss it all



Walking on a Chinese
Walking on a Chinese Wall

Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall

Butterfly, spread
Your painted wings
From an answer
From the Ching

By the stream
Stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin, scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

Three misty nights
Waiting by the shore
May be that my lover
Comes no more

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

Come down the clouds
To the sea of flames
From the mountain
Hear the cry of pain

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
On the Chinese Wall, oh, yeah
Watching for the coins to fall

(On the Chinese Wall)
Butterfly, spread your wings
From an answer from the Ching

(Watching for the coins to fall)
Blue red silk on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest, oh, no

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall.......



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Watcher of the skies watcher of all
His is a world alone no world is his own
He whom life can no longer surprise
Raising his eyes beholds a planet unknown

[Verse 2]
Creatures shaped this planet's soil
Now their reign has come to an end
Has life again destroyed life
Do they play elsewhere, do they know
More than their childhood games?
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth

[Verse 3]
Judge not this race by empty remains
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead?
For now, the lizard's shed its tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth

[Verse 4]
From life alone to life as one
Think not your journey's done
For though your ship be sturdy, no
Mercy has the sea
Will you survive on the ocean of being?
Come ancient children hear what I say
This is my parting counsel for you on your way

[Verse 5]
Sadly now your thoughts turn to the stars
Where we have gone you know you never can go
Watcher of the skies watcher of all
This is your fate alone, this fate is your own

[Instrumental Outro]



If you take the tears from crying eyes
Will the hurt just disappear?
Put a weapon in the hand of a frightened man
Will he show no fear?
So we stand and we watch while the city lights go out one by one
Mother Nature sits on the other side with a loaded gun

Why is there blue sky, why is there red sky?
Now's the time to ask the reason
Should the blue sky, meet the red sky?
Should the rules have to change at all?

We all know whatever they say
Time is on our side
This world has been here before
Just going round and round

We all agree as far as we can see
It's just the way of the world
That's how it's meant to be

There's right and there's wrong
There's weak and there's strong

It's just the way of the world
And that's how it's meant to be

Take the motion from a spinning wheel, and watch it stop
Take the danger out of a naked flame, and what have you got
If you take the anger out of a broken heart, you feel no pain
Could you swear if you had that second chance, you wouldn't do it again

Why is there blue sky, why is there red sky?
Now's the time to ask the reason
Should the blue sky, meet the red sky?
Should the rules have to change at all?

We all know whatever they say
Time is on our side
This world has been here before just going round and round
(Round and round)

We all agree as far as we can see
It's just the way of the world
That's how it's meant to be

There's right and there's wrong
There's weak and there's strong

It's just the way of the world
And that's how it's meant to be

[Keyboard Solo (Tony Banks)]

We all agree as far as we can see
It's just the way of the world
That's how it's meant to be

There's right and there's wrong
There's weak and there's strong

It's just the way of the world
And that's how it's meant to be



[Verse 1]
She came looking for me with her arms open wide
Like some long lost friend of mine
She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me ?
I said 'No, I don't believe I do
So she looked me up and down
And undressed me with her eyes
Then she said 'You've got everything I need, you've got everything I want

So I said 'OK

[Chorus 1]
You can wear my hat
You can have my coat
You can take my shirt
'Cause I don't need it
You can wear my shoes
You can take my socks
Come on take my bag it's yours

[Chorus 2]
If you love it
You can have it if you love it
Ain't no problem if you love it
Come on take it if you love it

[Verse 2]
So her friend came up to me
With a pen and paper in her hand
Expressing some interest in the number of my room
She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me?
I said 'No,' she said 'Can I appeal to you?

So I looked her up and down
And realising her insinuations I blushed
She said 'Listen babe you don't know me
No you don't know me but you owe me

[Bridge]
And I love you
And I love you
Put your arms around me 'cause I love you
I got all your records and I love you
So I suggested

[Chorus 1]
You can wear my hat
You can have my coat
You can take my shirt
'Cause I don't need it
You can wear my shoes
You can take my socks
Come on take my bag it's yours

[Chorus 2]
If you love it
You can have it if you love it
Ain't no problem if you love it
Come on take it if you love it

[Verse 3]
Well later on that day this guy came to me
With a scrap of paper in his hand
He said 'Hey buddy can you sign your name for me?
I said 'Why, do I owe you money?' He said 'No'
I said 'Listen pal do I know you? Have we ever met?
Why do you want my name on this little piece of paper?

[Bridge]
He said 'I love you
I don't know you but I love you
Like my brother I love you
Put your arms around me 'cause I love you
I said 'Hey let's not rush things

[Chorus 1]
You can wear my hat
You can have my coat
You can take my shirt
'Cause I don't need it
You can wear my shoes
You can take my socks
Come on take my bag it's yours

[Chorus 2]
If you love it
You can have it if you love it
Ain't no problem if you love it
Come on take it if you love it

[Outro]
You can wear my hat
You can wear my hat
You can wear my hat
You can wear my hat



[Verse 1]
My harbour lights are fading fast
Soon they'll disappear
Alone i sit in darkness
Hoping someone might come near
Though i wait, though i try
No one ever comes
And the feeling that i have flood over me
The river starts to run

[Chorus]
We fly so close [x2]
Sometimes we fly too close

[Verse 2]
Every place you run to, everywhere you turn
There are places that you know you should not go
But some bridges just won't burn
All my life, though i try
I cannot change the past
And the ghosts that come back to haunt you
Make you realize at last

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My heart is racing much faster now
Life passes before my eyes
Something's i see, they make me smile
Something's they make me cry
So i look, so i try to find
A lesson i can learn
The passing of time hasn't changed my mind
And the ghosts i know return

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We fly so close, you and i sometimes
Sometimes we fly so close
We'll never know how many times
We fly so close
We fly so close

When I grow up to be a man
Like my father was when I was young
I hope I can make him so proud of me
Proud enough to call me his son

What makes these people so different now?
What makes these times so strange?
Seems most people got most everything they need
How come we see this change?

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
When will we ever learn?
Yet I'm a believer

When I was a boy, did we have more respect?
This world seemed a nicer place to be
But time slowly passes, and one day you look around
You hardly recognize what you see

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
When will we ever learn?
Yet I'm a believer

We're all sons of our fathers
Sometimes I feel like mine
And I can hear him say the things I say
Seems all things come around in time

Why these things happen we'll never know
Guess that was then and this is now
We always knew that change was gonna come
But I want to go back
Please tell me how

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
When will we ever learn?
Yet I'm a believer



[Verse 1]
We said goodbye to a dear old friend
And we packed our bags and left feeling sad
It's the only way
We said hello as we turned the key
A new roof over our heads
Gave a smile
It's the only way
Only way

[Chorus]
Turn your head
And don't look back
Set your sails for a new horizon
Don't turn around don't look down
Oh there's life across the tracks
And you know it's really not surprising
It gets better when you get there oh

[Verse 2]
Well it really don't matter much where you are
Cos home is in your heart
It's a feeling that you wake with one day
Some people key p running all their life
And still find they haven't gone too far
They don't see it's the feeling inside - the feeling inside oh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We said hello as we turned the key
A new roof over our heads
Gave a smile - it's the only way



There's a place for us, somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air wait for us somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to look, time to care
Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, someday, somewhere



[Verse 1]
We stand, hang our heads disbelieving
Then not knowing how could such a thing be wrong
We wonder just what they must be thinking
To take a life of one so young

[Chorus]
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?
How far must we go, to prove to you?

[Verse 2]
We wait and we wonder how this happened
Killing the old, the innocent, the young
While sons follow in fathers footsteps not understanding
That what they do could somehow be so wrong

[Chorus]
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?
How far must we go, to prove to you?

[Bridge]
So we will wait and we'll wonder

[Verse 3]
No regrets, no forgiveness, no compassion
These brave heroes only know to hit and run
Slowly my sadness turns to rage and we wonder
How can these scars ever heal, when all is said and done

[Chorus]
So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?
How far must we go, to prove to you?

So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?
How far must we go, to prove to you?

[Outro]
So we wait and we wonder
We wait and we wonder
We wait and we wonder
We wait and we wonder
We wait and we wonder
We wait and we wonder
We wait and we wonder
We wait and we wonder



[Verse1]
Yeah, 다시 microphone과 deep kiss, muah
내 가사는 매 구절이 직찍
난 내가 보고 듣고 한 것 아님 그냥 찢지
빤히 걸릴 구라치면 그냥 내가 빙신, hah
내가 왜 내 무덤을 파, 난 JM 등 뒤엔 안 묻어서 가
Microphone을 잡고 한 길만 십수 년을 rhyme
뱉었단 게 자랑이지, 어찌 부심이냐?
어디 나를 쫓아오려 해, 뚜벅이가?
딱 하나 부러워, 니들의 유지비가
내가 존경받는 이윤 최고라서가 아냐
매번 내 한계를 한 단계 더 부시니까 (boom)
내 존재 자체가 문제지, 난 마지막 chapter
답안지, 난 틀릴 수가 없지, 그래 100%
물오른 mic checker, 난 절대 안 해 센 척
난 쎄, 이 병신아, 이 verse는 Swings의 왼손

[Hook]
Whoa! Ha!
Whoa! Ha!
Whoa! Ha!
Whoa! Ha!
JM! JM! JM!
JM! JM! JM!

[Verse2]
내 작전은 작전이 없다는 게 함정
내 나잇값을 못한다는 게 유일한 단점
난 한 번 한다 한 건 끝을 보지 완전
막 나가는 새끼, 막가파로 회사명을 바꿔
니 rap은 화석 안에 화석 안에 화석
연구대상 shit, 연구할게, 니가 죽고 나서
지지리도 떨고 있네 궁상만
하품 나와, 니들 rap은 4컷 만화 극장판
너희한테 Hip-Hop은 헤나, 내겐 영구적인 문신
단순한 음악이 아냐, think bigger than 웅진
계속 꿈틀대는 나의 성장판
난 정상만 향해서 올라, 계속 위치를 바꾸지
역마살 낀 놈 간지로 다가 been there and done that
니 옆에 형제들에게 전해 나는 건재해
내 말이 내 무기, 찰칵, 난 죽이게 뱉어
언프리나 신청해, pussy ass rappers

[Hook]
Whoa! Ha!
Whoa! Ha!
Whoa! Ha!
Whoa! Ha!
JM! JM! JM!
JM! JM! JM!
JM! JM! JM!

Sometimes everything seems outta my reach
No matter how hard I try
Sometimes I feel like nothing at all inside
With everything that I try to hold on to
Just seem to slip away

And though I fall it keeps calling me back again
But I keep looking
I'll find myself
I keep searchin to find the real me

Who am I?
Tell me
Where do I come from?
Who am I?
Tell me
'Cause it's like I don't fit in at all

Sometimes I feel like runnin' away
And leaving it all behind
And try to a place where I belong

I'll Sink Or Swim
I Keep Searchin To Find The Real Me

[Verse 1]
I know she says she wants me
I hear it every day
And I know she know it keeps me
Well there ain't no other way

[Chorus 1]
But she's got a heart must be made of stone
Because when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone
She says
Who said I would

[Bridge]
She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
She fills me full of loving
Oh then she sets me free

[Chorus 1]
But she's got a heart must be made of stone
Because when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone
She says
Who said I would, tell me, who said I would
Who said I would, who said I would

[Chorus 2]
I'm not the only one but I do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should

[Bridge]
Tell me
Who said I would, who said I would

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
You're not the only one but you do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
I don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should

[Verse 2]
Who said I would (who said I would)
Now she knows when she calls me
I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot
But she don't know it's her body never mine

[Chorus 1]

[Outro][x2]
Who said I would, who said I would



I know she says she wants me, I hear it every day
And I know she knows it keeps me, well there ain't no other way
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would

She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
She fills me full of lovin', oh, then she sets me free
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would

I'm not the only one, but I'll do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should

Tell me, who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would

But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
You're not the only one, but you'll do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
You don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should
Who said I would (who said I would)

Now she knows when she calls me, I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot, and she'll know it's her body, not her mind
And she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
(who said I would)
(who said I would)



[Verse 1]
Why can't it wait 'til morning?
We can talk about it then
Because I've had a drink too many
And my troubles, well I ain't got any
Why can't it wait 'til daylight?
Things will seem much clearer then
I'm tired and my eyes are weary
And I just want you lying here with me

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
I'll make it oh, so nice

[Verse 2]
Well I don't want to think about what we've said
And I don't want to know why we hurt ourselves
Because I just want to hold you so close to me
It'll take care of itself and I want to sleep
So why can't it wait 'til next time?
Because that time may never come
Stay here with your arms around me
You're going nowhere without me

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
I'll make it oh, so nice for you

[Outro]
So why can't it wait 'til morning?
I make it soon as soon as soon as leave you[?]



Instrumental



You are the thunder
You're the lightning up above
I call your name out
Woman, you want love

And when I touch you
I see heaven in your eyes
And when I kiss you
There's a storm rising within me

Woman, stay, show me the way
Into your heart, light up the dark
I've always dreamed
Of the love that you bring

Oh woman, stay, don't turn me away
You're the angel of light
Who leaves in the night, but I need you
Can't you see, I love you woman?

You are the fire
You are the wind that turns my heart
You are the sunlight
Shining beauty in the dark

And when I saw you
I felt your power in my soul
And when you touched me
I knew I had lost control

Woman, stay, show me the way
Into your heart, light up the dark
I've always dreamed
Of the love that you bring

Oh woman, stay, don't turn me away
You're the angel of light
Who leaves in the night, but I need you
Can't you see, I love you woman?

But you are the fire
You are the wind
You are the sunlight
I need you [Incomprehensible]

Now I know
Heaven sent you from above
You are woman
You were sent for me to love

Woman, stay but you'll go away
Now my eyes can see
All the love that I need
For the first time I can believe in woman

I can believe in woman
I need you by my side
You are the flower, you are the rain
You bring me sunlight
You bring me pain, woman



[Verse 1: Roland Orzabal]
You better love loving and you better behave
You better love loving and you better behave
Woman in chains
Woman in chains

[Verse 2: Oleta Adams]
Calls her man the great white hope
Says she's fine, she'll always cope
Woman in chains
Woman in chains

[Chorus 1: Roland Orzabal, Oleta Adams]
Well, I feel lying and waiting is a poor man's deal
A poor man's deal
And I feel hopelessly weighed down by your eyes of steel
Your eyes of steel
Well, it's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains, woah
Woman in chains
Woman in chains

[Verse 3: Oleta Adams, Roland Orzabal]
Trades her soul as skin and bone
You better love loving and you better behave
Sells the only thing she owns
You better love loving and you better behave
Woman in chains
The sun and the moon
Woman in chains

[Interlude: Roland Orzabal]
Men of stone
Men of stone

[Chorus 2: Roland Orzabal, Oleta Adams, Both]
Well, I feel deep in your heart there are wounds time can't heal
That time can't heal
And I feel somebody somewhere is trying to breathe
Well, you know what I mean
It's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains

[Post-Chorus: Roland Orzabal, Oleta Adams, Both]
It's under my skin but out of my hands
I'll tear it apart, but I won't understand
Somebody somewhere is trying to breathe
I will not accept the greatness of man

[Interlude: Roland Orzabal, Oleta Adams]
It's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains
Gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains

[Outro: Both, Roland Orzabal]
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
The sun and the moon
So free her
The wind and the rain
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
The sun and the moon
So free her
The wind and the rain
So free her

[Intro]
I need love, love
Ooh, ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine;

[Chorus]
My mama said, "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

[Verse 1]
How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone

[Chorus]
I remember mama said, "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"
How long must I wait
How much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

[Verse 2]
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hanging on

[Chorus]
I remember mama said, "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

Now break!

[Verse 3]
Now love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
Hold me tight
I keep waiting
Ooh, till that day
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
No, you know it ain't easy

[Outro]
My mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"

To ease my mind
I need to find time to someone called mine

Set me free, why don't'cha, babe?
Get out my life, why don't'cha, babe?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a-comin' around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start?
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me

Hey, set me free, why don't'cha, babe?
Let me be, why don't'cha, babe?
(Ooo-oo-oo.)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
(Ooo-oo-oo.)
Now you don't really want me
You just keep me hangin' on

You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seein' you only breaks my heart again?

And there ain't nothing I can do about it!

Wo-oh oh-oh oh
(Set me free, why don't'cha, babe?)
Wo-oh oh-oh oh
(Get out my life), ((why don't'cha, babe?))
(Ooo-oo-oo.)
Set me free, why don't'cha, babe?
Get out my life, why don't'cha, babe?

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else

Hey-hey!

Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free?
(Ooo-oo-oo.)
Now, you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
(Ooo-oo-oo.)
Go on, get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
[Fade.]
(Ooo-oo-oo.)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on



[Verse 1]
Just as I thought I'd make it
You walk back into my life
Just like you never left
Just as I'd learned to be lonely
You call up to tell me
You're not sure if you're ready
But ready or not, you'll take what you've got and leave

[Chorus]
Leave me alone with my heart
I'm putting the pieces back together again
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
I can do without you, know what I mean

[Verse 2]
I wish I could write a love song
To show you the way I feel
Seems you don't like to listen
Oh but like it or not, take what you've got and leave

[Chorus 2]
Leave me alone with my heart
It's broken in two and I'm not thinking too straight
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
You've taken everything else, you know what I mean



[Verse 1]
Just as I thought I'd make it
You walk back into my life
Just like you never left

But ready or not, you'll take what you've got and leave

[Chorus]
Leave me alone with my heart
I'm putting the pieces back together again
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
I can do without you, know what I mean

To show you the way I feel
Seems you don't like to listen
Oh but like it or not, take what you've got and leave

[Verse 1: Bure]
I gotta lotta things on my mind, I got more in my heart
Took a long time for me to make it out of the dark
When my grandma, died my whole life fell apart
I wanna do her proud so I'm making my mark
This world needs cleansing, this world needs mending
God is the greatest, on one knee I'm bending
Believe in yourself, that's the message I'm sending
Rise up, that's the message ascending
My grandmama was the strongest
For nonsense, she had a strong sense
Rest in peace Florence
I wanna pay homage
Acknowledge your knowledge
And sending your kids off to college
I'll never forget the memories
All the stories that you used to tell to me
I love you so much, I miss you so much
You so close now you can feel God's touch 'cause

[Hook: Phil Collins]
Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on, now and forever more
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart, always

[Verse 2: Bure]
Now what can I say 'bout Mr. T
In the sixth grade, you was always so good to me
At one point I felt I didn't belong
But you gave me that confidence and made me strong
You was watching over me
Told me how happy life was supposed to be
Can't thank you enough for that
I'll be the best I put my word on that

[Hook 2: Phil Collins]
And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on, now and forever more

[Verse 3: Bure]
I owe my lives to y'all
I don't listen to the haters 'cause what do they know
You're there for me when I call
So watch out for me 'cause I'm bout to blow
And after all is said and done
Your lives will never be forgotten
Who I am is thanks to you
Just hold on tight and I'll be there soon
Lord forgive me for the sins that I've committed
I admit it, sometimes I really have been wicked
Been pushing myself to the limit
I've been taking my chances and jumping right in it
I cried when you died 'cause at that point, I felt like no one was at my side
I wanna live happily
But I can't do that without my family

[Hook 3: Phil Collins]
You'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever more

Ooh, you'll be in my heart (You'll be here in my heart)
No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
You'll be in my heart (I'll be there)
Always
Always...

[Outro]
Just look over your shoulder (x3)

What was it you said to me
Back in the days when things looked fine
'bout how we would be together
Until we left the earth behind
Oh, it's funny how things can change
Cos there was a time I thought I'd be the one
Who'd leave and start again
But now I'd stay forever

Ooh my hopes are as the leaves upon the water
Just sunk in the night
And though I know you couldn't care, you oughtta
Ah, the end of a life
Or maybe when you're older, and you're thinking back
You might recall
Now did I act carefully, did I do right?
Or were we meant to be, all of our lives
In love and harmony, all of our lives?

So now, take my hand
Come, hold me closely
As near as you can
Believing all that we could be
And all that we have been
And all that we are

Everyday seems summertime
The river flow with wine
Ooh when you were here with me
I wish we'd stayed that way forever

Oh my hopes are as the leaves upon the water
Just sunk in the night
And though I know you couldn't care, you oughtta
Ah, the end of a life
Or maybe when you're older, and you're thinking back
Well you might recall
Now did I act carefully, did I do right?
Or were we meant to be, all of our lives
In love and harmony, all of our lives?

So now, take my hand
Come, hold me closely
As near as you can
Believing all that we could be
And all that we have been
And all that we are

Oh my hopes were as the leaves upon the water
Ah, sunk in the night
And though I know you couldn't care, you oughtta
Oh, the end of a life
And maybe when you're older, and you're thinking back
Oh, you might recall
Now did I act carefully, did I do right?
Or were we meant to be, all of our lives
In love and harmony, all of our lives?

So now, take my hand
Come, hold me closely
As near as you can
Believing all that we could be
And all that we have been
And all that we are



I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinkin' of you
Oh, you treat me badly
But I love you madly

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

I don't want you
But I need you
I don't wanna kiss you
But I need to
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

Tighter
Tighter

I wanna leave you
Don't wanna stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
Oh, I wanna split now
I just can't quit now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Yeah, you really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)



[Chorus 1]
Somehow you reach in and you touch my heart
Somehow you reach in, you touch my soul
When I look at you, I see everything we could be

[Chorus 2]
Eyes wide open, looking at me
What can I offer you that you've never seen
Just don't be afraid, someone is watching
You will see

[Verse]
Somehow when you smile the day seems brighter
Somehow when you smile you melt my heart
When I look at you I see all things we should be
And in your darkest hour, hold out your hand for me
Something will guide you, I'll be beside you
And when its rough out there, I'm with you everywhere
I will be right behind you if you should fall
Someday you will find everything you look for
Someday you will find a love like mine
When you smile at her you will feel the things you could be

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]



I've been trying hard to forget
That you've been cheating
Wishin' you I'd never met
'Cause you've been cheatin'

Can't you know lies can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
While you sit cryin', you've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me

Oh yeah

Yeah, you made me suspect and I know
You don't want me
Cookies crumble, and that's how it goes
You don't want me

Can't you know lies can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
While you sit cryin', you've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me

Oh yeah

Another lover you discover
Our love's gone and I don't know why
It's just as well, though at last I do know
All you said was just a lie

So I'm trying hard to forget
That you've been cheatin'
And wishin' you I'd never met
'Cause you've been cheating

Can't you know lies can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
While you sit cryin', well you've been lyin'
Girl you've been cheatin', cheatin' on me

Ooh, ooh, baby (you've been cheating)
You been cheatin' (you've been cheating)
You been cheatin' on me (you've been cheating)



[Chorus]
You've been in love that little bit too long
You've been in love and i think that you know
You've been in love it's time to move on
You've been in love and it's starting to show

[Verse 1]
She's getting to used to your face, getting too used to your smile
She's saying the same things every morning before you leave her
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind
You'd better look out, cause he's not far behind

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Suddenly she's trying to please you, you start to think she's acting strange
And after all these years she wears make-up in the morning
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind
You'd better look out, cause he's not far behind

[Bridge]
Did you really believe she's doing it all for you?
Oh, can't you see, there's somebody else
You never showed it, you should have known it
You've been in love, yeah you've been in love
You've been in love, yeah you've been in love

[Verse 3]
Going round singing all those love songs, songs you haven't heard for years
You're going to have to ask her why she's so happy
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind
But it may be too late, and i know why

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
To show, show, you've been in love, oh oh [x2]



Hör die Wörter, die dein Schicksal prägen
Zwei Welten, eine Familie
Glaub an dich, vertrau darauf
Das Leben zeigt dir wie
Ein unberührtes Paradies
In einer samtgrünen Welt
Wo Liebe lebt und Frieden wohnt
Sanfte Spuren die im Sand verwehen
Zwei Welten, eine Familie
Glaub an dich, vertrau darauf
Das Leben zeigt dir wie
Im Schutz der Bäume ist das Glück
Familie und Geborgenheit
Wo Liebe lebt und Frieden wohnt
Immer weiter, gegen den Strom
Ruf deinen Plan ins Leben
So wirst du groß, so wirst du stark
'was neues beginnt
Doch Gefahren lauern auch hier
Kein Wort beschreibt der Mutter Leid
Kein Herz verheilt nach solchem Schmerz
Vorbei der Traum, die Hoffnung bleibt
Du hörst etwas aus der Ferne rufen
Zwei Welten, eine Familie
Glaub an dich, vertrau darauf
Das Leben zeigt dir wie
