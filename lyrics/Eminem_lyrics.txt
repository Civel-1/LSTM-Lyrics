[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in your grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated
While you're breathing
And you'll be leaving the receiving room this evening with Jesus
You hate on us? We'll be waiting on eight corners
Swarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
I'll hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floating around, drowned, faced-down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull-up to the Seven Mile drive through
At McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a driver out of his Eddie Bauer
When it drives by me at 90 miles an hour
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my veins, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading - I won't die, I'm never leaving
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through them, put the heat to them
Be careful you might get what you ask for
That's what you false ballers get mugged and gagged for
Your life flashing in front of your eyes in fast forward
Dearly departed, I don't even listen to artists
I'm pissing the farthest, and I'm also hitting the hardest
I'm very intelligent
Compare me to cameras
I flash, and shoot what I see, and steady developing
I fly you out of your whip with one try of the trigger
Out of your clique, ain't one nigga out of his shit
You gotta be kidding, bring all of them niggas
They all gotta be hit quick, and they all gotta be hitten
It's not a game, and I ain't playing
Yo if I ain't lived it, did it, or seen it, then I ain't saying
I put a hole right in your chest
Stick a knife in your soul
Then take your life after taking your death
I'm nice!
That ain't even counting the endless bars
Friends with scars, wondering which Benz is ours
Pretending to ball could even be the ending of y'all
The minute you fall, my criminals will finish you off
I argue with no one
You got a gun? Alright show one
If you ain't got heart now, you ain't gon' just grow one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm keeping it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
'Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flipping off the police while I'm leaping a wall
Take a bunch of Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got your little son, you'll be receiving a call
You're lucky this little punks still breathing at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink your teeth in your jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is giving you a reason to stall
I'm cocking this deuce-deuce and I'm squeezing it off
At the first burp and a fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasing a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm gonna give it to you straight this time
Lace this bong
Bring it to your face until the Jakes respond
Guard y'all shit
I don't care how hard y'all hit
I got cats with bats you wouldn't play hardball with
I splatter intestines quick, before you can blast
Or handle your weapon, you'll get stabbed in a matter of seconds
We ain't worried about threats cause God got us
We popping Cris, y'all sipping Moet by-products
I ain't scared to die, let's blast, it's gonna be either
If you both die then your casket is gonna be deeper
Yo, you ain't a Don
You don't even know what beef is
What you competing with, our hittin' make concrete give
Yo I came out
Naked at birth, making it worse
Making a verse sacred and shaking the Earth
Niggas got plenty opinions about Royce
But they ain't got a voice
I'm doper than them, so they ain't got a choice
Niggas be playing battle-battle
Not understanding themselves
They babble-babble that's why they stay on the shelves
Playing yourself, I'm promising threats to test y'all
Keep doing this rap shit until UPS calls
I see why you must hate me
I'm sharp enough to cut gravy
It's just crazy, niggas is such babies
Real as they come, dancing
Killing for fun, advancing
Healing my thumb, killing for fun
Cock, squeeze and make every nigga freeze in here
Stop breathing, there better be some cheese in here
If there's any MC's in here, I hope you read me clear
You seeing peace, beef with the C's in here
Yo you ain't fly
I got shit that you can't buy
You can't lie, you drink St. Ides and fake high
Take pie, try to flip it
You don't nothing about that shit
If was you I wouldn't risk it

[Verse 5: Eminem]
I wouldn't risk it...
Rappers get hit with this verbal biscuit
Hey yo, yo yo yo yo
Keep the same beat, keep the same beat, keep the same beat
It goes like this yo
My attitude is worse than N.W.A.'s was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does
You see me standing outside of your building; screaming
Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just trying to get my porno career started
Every place and event.. (been there, done that)
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
Lesson one: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two: Face 'em and diss 'em
Don't give 'em a demo; kidnap 'em
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus
And put yours on the owner's table
Lesson four: Know you heard this before:
"Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't
Givin you shit bitch - don't even bother asking me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spitting
Cause I'm always shitting when I'm rapping like Master P
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fucking Aaliyah
I splish splash while I'm taking a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fucking your wife in the ass
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass

And it's like that, and it's like that

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
It don't stop
5-9, Slim Shady yo
The rap auctioneer, spitting out double figures
For fans to repeat, handling heat
The Commander in Chief, I should've been banned from the streets
Flee after I stab an MC with twin crutches
You've been had by the phantom of beef
Release when the paper and pen touches
While y'all talking
My venomous rap splits
Get your ass kicked punk
Your kind get offed often
80 niggas deep with heat at the mall walking
You'll either get shot with all barkers
Or get knocked upside your head with big blocks
Till you spit teeth
You're all soft and up shit's creek in a long coffin
I get work without a single fiend involved
I'm married to the mob, I mean for real, ring and all
Basically that means I ain't your average rap nigga
You'll get slapped and thrown in the back of an Ac(ura) bigger
With the latch cracked, trunk open
So you can look up at the stars
Fill your pockets with plastic explosives
Drive to cover, detonate the bomb
Blow you up with the car and flee the scene to cop another
Morph right into the physical form of your spirit
In front of your eyes, and make you battle yourself
Like Shang Tsung with wisdom in the brilliance of a million disciples
Equipped with a right hook to split a building
The pure repper of the African race
Sent here to knock you off your square and put you back in your place
Babylon battalion, holding your engineer ransom
For your master, so I can sabotage your album

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, '97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I’m on some loc shit, some fed up with the being broke shit
I’m not to joke with, bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Having a coke fit, going through withdrawls daily
Shoot-up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brain’s dusted, I’m disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers cause I’m always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking, talking about “Who want it?”
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book; I’ve done it
My 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me sticking you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, crystal-meth manufacturer
Stole your momma’s Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boosting Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back bitch
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasing dips – take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping ‘em and trapping ‘em in abusive relationships
Fuck up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Cut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
I’m fucked up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
I’m sick of this shit, what’s Dr. Kevorkian’s phone number?

[Verse 8: Royce da 5'9"]
It's like this right?
Bust it
You get laced by the gun, in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the tongue, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative flusher to enemies
The impact will be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black, poised since birth
Birth? Tore the womb up
To hit the Earth like an asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Any nigga can say fuck me and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man this is hot, I'm out of my shit
From the bottom I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise and eclipse, and occasional trips to the beer store
And switch-up, the breed of MC to stick a bitch up
Bigger and speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I crushed all y'all, now you want a collaboration
But fuck that, you stepped up, so I'm gonna fuck your rep up
Tear the rest up, with every joint that I press up
Handling heat and ammo, bullets passing me by
Challenging me to battle? Man, you asking to die
Narrow off niggas, squeeze a grenade until it's dissolved
Bite the barrel of a revolver and spin it
Nigga forget it, I earned it
I kill you then come to your funeral and strangle you to confirm it
Minds carry malaria, sick
Ask niggas who the best is, you'll hear 5-9 in every area
Crushing your head, hunting you dead
You ain't nice
I battled you before, I don't remember nothing you said
You was wack, I was gonna quit on it till I thought
My dick is big enough for all of y'all niggas to get on it
Making you high off of the smoke, often you're cold
Making y'all join that big hip-hop nation in the sky
And it's easy believe me, you better have been fronting
When you said you was hot, cause you couldn't please me if you was begging me

[Verse 9: Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Who came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O that I sniffed of cane
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each others' name
Run in the ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers Lane, to the night you were thought of
And cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'm gonna throw a head-butt so hard, it'll knock us both out

Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes
In this day and age in this period of time
Tryna battle Eminem is worse than
David Starr tryna battle Proof, Eye-Ku, BFlat and Bizarre
(unintelligible)
That's why you beg to differ me,you ain't got no style
Plus you lack delivery, not to brag
I don't need to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
(unintelligible)
You couldn't slip up in the zone, if I put banana peels
Around this fucking microphone
So get a bulldozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down
'cause that's the only way you 'recking shop



[Verse 1]
Everybody, duck down, all you hear is the sound
Of Slim Shady spittin' rounds at the Lyricist Lounge
What year is this now? I don't know, I forgot
All I know is that I'd die for pot, make the cypher hot
Smoke weed and fuck up my life a lot
Give me the money now, bitch
Did you want to see your wife or not?
'Fore I stab her wit' this knife I got
I got a sci-fi plot like a science fiction flick that I'm a hit you wit'
I got the Outsidaz up in this bitch
Peace to Thirstin' Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed wit' badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna step to this and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin' wit' your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, it hurts worth
When they get abolished, polyps'll murk worse
Wrote a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, hollerin', 'Nurse, nurse'
You said this shot would numb it, bitch, it just hurts worse
Rappers can't fuck wit' the way that I spit it, lyrical lit it
Now you did it when I committed, get his rhymes out here
Off the top of the dome wit' a popular poem
Fuck a team, I can stop you alone
Rappers don't understand it



[RAP BATTLE 1]
I'ma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, 'specially when you wrote ninety-percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'Fore you come up missin', like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of literature that I'm spittin' be hittin'
You gonna swear to God this shit was written
But it wasn't, I'll kill a dozen rappers when I'm buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now, you boys are about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladimir Konstantinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

[RAP BATTLE 2]
I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin', "I'm about to whip his ass
‘Cause I'ma do some written shit, plus I get to go last."
Well, guess what? Even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo' verse
I'm 'bout to slice you like a Ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take your fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope emcee?
Look, don't get mad and start takin' your period out on me

[RAP BATTLE 3]
You wanna represent on the microphone, but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'ma do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month? You couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I rip him like a paper mache
I heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched, like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out, like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush
I don't give a fuck, ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin' back with pimp shit
I laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

[RAP BATTLE 4]
Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah—stop babblin'!
You so fuckin' wack I'ma walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion
Don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style is just one big sike
Take a big hike, bitch, you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit, like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew
And I don't give a fuck, I slaughter boys
Especially wack-ass emcees that will wear a fake-ass corduroy

[RAP BATTLE 5]
I'm 'bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck—this shit fits you perfect!
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with you
I'll let a razor slit you, 'til they have to staple-stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn! All your white jokes just backfired
‘Cause, bitch, you barkin' up the wrong tree
Now go tell all your boys that you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya
Bitch, you better recognize me, like I look familiar
Anything you say, I'ma kill ya
Grill ya, when I fuckin' drill ya
I'm Marsh, but you're the one that's mellow



[Intro]
Hi kids, do you like Kim's bullshit? (No!)
Wanna see me stick her fucking eyeballs right in to my anus?

[Verse 1]
I got a fucking time traveling machine to go back all to this
And see all the piss that she gave me, bitch
She made me fall on my ass
The walls are caving in and I gotta go ham on this bitch
Like, woah, so we never fell in love so I didn't have to
Go through that shit no more
It's like a nugget, I'm hugging these sluts
That are bothering this fucking chick when I murder
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
Just a bit of it
And stop slurping the blood off her face, or I'll murder you too with a bag full of mace and if Kim comes to my house and says "Wanna get back together?"
And I say "No, get out before I [slit your throat] and splatter the blood on this sweater!"
Blue eyes, red eyes, green eyes, bloody eyes
Hi Mom, you're back again, rock climbing my dick to see how famous my fucking life is?

[Hook x2]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posie
Kim, Kim, be shady like me, I'm trying for the 4th
Stop being a bitch, please, walking across the highway
Playing Chicken, while brains splatter all over the road like
"ricken, ricken", my phone's dead, now how can I call the bitch?
I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer
Now I'll come to her house and [slaughter her ancesters]
Boo! I'm a ghost, you happy to see me? I'm taking your soul
Well shit, you don't believe me? Boom, I did it, do you believe me now? Shit whatever, I'm the king so hand me the crown

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, I said 1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, no other faggot can control my life



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Tim Westwood, Marley Marl and Slim Shady and MC Proof
Proof on my side, my sidekick
Y'all can suck my wide -ick
Said the "ick" without the D in front of it
None of you rappers want none of it
I’ll put you on punishment like Big Pun
Wanna suck my "ick-ick"? Here's a big one
I'll do it with the fluid that I’m spillin'
I'm illin', plus I'm chillin', I'm not a villain
Forget the controversy surroundin' me
And all these fake-ass press people surroundin’ me, houndin’ me
But I don't give a damn ’cause I smoked a pound of weed
Y'all don't want none of me
So get from in front of me like Chuck D
All the these bitches wanna walk up and fuck me
Whoops! Did I say that or did I think it?
I don't know but my brain starts shrinkin’
My spine starts shrivelin', givin' 'em adrenaline
When I'm killin' 'em and no DNR for Benylin
And this is right off the top
Take a bottle of pop and bit off the top
Tim, I said that last time when I was on your show
But it really doesn't matter 'cause I kick this slowest flow
With a flow that's slow, really doesn't matter
Said it backwards, but all you fake-ass rappers are actors
And I'ma bring it to ya
You got a life and you got a song
But don't know how to sing it, do ya?
No you don't, so I'ma kill it
I'ma cook a cracked egg in a skillet and eat it
And smoke it and whatever, take my dick and poke it
Blastin' off right now!

[Interlude: Marley Marl]
Aight! Ha-ha-ha
No doubt
No doubt, baby

[Verse 2: Proof & Eminem]
Proof!
MC Proof, here on the mic raise the roof
Kill 'em like 180-Proof
D12, D12, D12 (D12)
Too many white and black people I been gnarly
Rockin' with Tim Westwood and Mr. Marley
It's time for us to do y'all, who y'all?
We break balls like cue balls, while y'all switch up like RuPaul
It's true y'all don't wanna mess around with us
A lotta people I been with is dangerous
Why's this beat so fast?
I know

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Wow, this beats are a little bit too fast for my headache
But I don't give a damn, someone call a paramedic
'Cause I'm pathetic, I need a little bit of Excedrin to make my damn head spin
I'll do a head spin, a windmill and then chill, and then kill (Westwood!)
Whatever, I'm clever with these beat that I kick over these techniques
Like technique 12 inches, I get blunted
And any rapper that wants it, don't want it
They kick in front it, right to their face
I give, I'ma smackin' it and I don't give a damn
'Cause I got Proof backin' it
Y'all don't wanna step to me
You put your life in jeopardy
Y'all better choose your mother— weaponry
Ayo Proof, get on the mic
Show these mother— what it's like

[Verse 4: Eminem & Proof]
All you motherf— goin' get f— up now
Aw man
No cussin', no potions, slow motion, jack off with no lotion
I'm slower than the flow in the ocean
I can cause an explosion, to knock water out of an ocean
When I'm coastin', jumpin' the rowboat and start flowin' in it
I brought the microphone, my -ick I'm totin' it
Like a Glock that cock
I rock the microphone and rock the spot
And rappers jock a lot, Proof come in whether you're wack or not (These voices)
Or dope or not (These voices)
(I hear them, I hear them voices)
(These voices I hear them)
(And when they talk I'll follow)
(I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow all these voices)
(These voices I hear them)
(And when they talk I'll follow)
(I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow)

[Interlude: Marley Marl & Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, I'ma give you this hot beat
Marley Marl style
Go ahead, Proof
Slim Shady, Marley Marl joint exclusive freestyle

[Verse 5: Proof & Emimen]
Yo, exclusive
For all our supporters
Roll your tape recorders
This is goin' overseas to many different borders (Westwood!)
Here it is, Paul Bunyan, he speaks Yiddish
Niggas and Slim Shady run for the English to the British
Time for them to get down, stood up, listen to us
We can rock the microphone and never got to cuss
Us, trust, nuts, of course we dangerous
[?] derange the bus is danger
Well I flip it and I kick and I rip it and I flip
I figgity back the microphone and figgity-figgity-wheepsy
Yo, check it out, yo, my hair ain't nappy
But, yo, can this beat please get a little more happy?
I diggity what for biggity what
I biggity bust a savage
I biggity down, flip them down, flip them like a [?]

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, hold on, hold on, hold on (Holdin' on)
This beat a little bit too happy for my stinkin' self
Nah, this is nice, this is nice
This is some explicit shit that y'all can't get with
Get my wrists slit, I ain't a nit wit
But I'll smoke weed and pass out like a sampling snippet
Y'all don't wanna hear me rip it
Y'all don't wanna hear me flip it
I biggity-biggity-biggity-whoopsie
Like [?], you get a broken neck
My textbook, take a next look
Y'all don't wanna understand the way that I just come off at the top
And I can always drop everything that I stop
Or everything that I keep goin' and keep flowin'
Like the Energizer bunny, that's why it's funny
When rappers try to step to me and try to step to me
And battle me for money, 'cause you're a dummy
'Cause anything that you could say I could use against you (Westwood!)
And I can slice your ass like a chem suit
Let me continue, put the shit on the menu
Rappers don't wanna step to me
Because [?]
Then I continue to bust, never ever trust
Any MC 'cause I turn 'em all to friggin' dust

[Verse 7: Proof]
Yeah, we turn 'em to dust
Ayo, Dirty Dozen gon' battle with anything
You better off hop in a plane with JFK
Display lyrical styles, we get it dirty
It's Dirty Dozen, D12 [?]
No need to write this, 'cause when we write this
Y'all hear Shady, Proof, Bizarre and [?]
It's time to hype this, get it with this
It's Tim Westwood, get on your best foot
Your chest could take a slug from us
Do drug with us, you bug with us? Nah
Don't even try that, you hear this stuff?
Well, next time, the LP buy that
No time to hide that
Ayo, the hi-hat, go buy that
You die flat for talkin' that
You get bust up, who's that?
Paul Rosenberg, yo, frozen turds
Get stepped over, it's time to get it

[Outro: Eminem, Marley Marl (& Proof)]
Paul Rosenberg
I'd like to thank y'all for comin' by, man
Y'all just ripped that
Did you rip my damn microphone?
Paul Rosenberg is a small frozen turd
Why y'all just ripped my damn microphone?
(Nah, we ain't did nothin' yet, yo)
Aye, peace London
Ma-Ma-Ma-Marley
Peace
Marley, Tim, I love y'all, peace
Thank you very much for havin' us



[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
I boss how I live
Fuck 'em hoe
God meant me
To push Bentleys
The Stat Quo
Still slammin' 'lac doors
This squad 'ill blow your brain out
Half-crazy
Bustin' out the window
Aight cut it, cook it, bag it
Distribute it through the city
Home get that cabbage
Take it, flip it
Turn illegal to legal
Launder, stay grindin'
Keepin' ya business on the under
Humble moves come up
Cops run up
But most of them corrupt
So what?
They want they cut
So pay 'em
All those who oppose the squad
Spray 'em
Got goons with MACs
Who kill for scratch
Okay I'm
One quick trip 'ill
And get you filled with gas
Broad day and niggas 'ill kill you
Without the mask
I'm getting bank
Like I'm shooting it from off the glass
Signed with Shady-Aftermath
Cause I'm after cash
Biatch

[Verse 2: Swift]
The way it go
Just heard my dog
Stat Quo flow
Ha, ya heard what he had to say
Use the words Swifty McVay
I'm ill enough to shoot a nigga through his pager
And if I missed
The shit's going exactly through his neighbor
My behavior's
Fatal enough to faint niggas
Old age and cradle
I shoot from unexpected angles
I changed ya facials
I could have you niggas hugging an angel
Literally
Niggas be crazy
I'm misery, breaking both of ya ankles
I diminish mentally
I turn you into a mimic of Kennedy
I don't go to sleep 'till I murder motherfuckers in trilogies
I recruit enemies
Friends ain't shit
They take yo ends and split
Willingly
What kind of shit got a nigga faking the funk
Dressed like George Clinton
But you hoes ain't making a buck
You out and about
With yo face frostbit
With a hustlin' mouth
But you really full of brussels sprouts
Husband or spouse
Your generation's running out
Because my gun's in ya mouth
Penetration coming (cumming) fast
We won, you lost
You got a witness program
Move out cold then John Walsh
Wild
And this the way we do
Emzy, Imma pass it to you
So what ya wanna do?

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
What I wanna do? What I wanna do?
Let me see right here, yo

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Not many people that I label would be able
To display table manners, but our plan is
To make this beat rock like scanners and make the fans just
Go bananas, yo, get our planners
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't under-
Stand this, yo, my plan is, yeah right
And y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Yo, check this—check this out
And if you rocking with ya necklace out, that's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo, my style is wretched
You can't fetch it, no you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause ya name I can't even pronunciate, you the—
Same type of mo'fucker to go and sucker
Punch Dre at the Vibe Awards, but he right behind the boards
The next day, so kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick, eat my ass
Whatever you won' do it's on you
Big Proof coming through with the mo—

[Verse 4: Proof]
Y'all niggas sing
Y'all done came to the Nina Ross war
Ya homie's a killa
But my killas they cost more
It's all inherited
I was boss born
Put eighteen in ya flesh
And make ya chest a golf course
Niggas know that we ain't even
You know why
(gasps) I'm still breathin'
Yeah I got that real heathen
With them steel beams on 'em
Through ya dreams on 'em
Like I'm still a fiend
Noted for mics
It's only right
You see my real team, brody
I do it live
I was sippin' on some cream soda
Heave phony
Fuck this back and forth
This ain't a tennis meet
I spray you industry gangstas
Cause they ain't in the streets
It's cool to beef
But why?
'Till you truce with or you trust me
I told you Puffy
And you can lose Big (B.I.G.)
I'm Proof
Who you could do big things with us
Spit dope
They call me Rick James bitch
Clip-clack
Bang-hit
Bang-drip
Drip fang of blood
Drip, drip, drank when sirens cop came
Body bag thick
Body bag, zip-zip
That's it
Fuck you bitch

[Stat Quo]
Down a dark street
It's the dirty Stat Quo
Lord have mercy
Breathe, hello I'm 'bout my cheese
The steez, mellow
Cash in the bank
On my grind in the paint
Oh, look how I do live with my boy Westwood
Up to no good
Smoking that good shit
See how I ball
Handle, handle my business
Eminem, Swift, P, Stat Quo that's it
Back on the track
Green Lantern done switched the beat
I'm guaranteed to my thang and drop the heat
My man Zeke is in the corner with him
Boss Hog, A-town, yes I be them
Do what I do freestyle, top of the dome
Don't fuck with my click
Leave Doc Dre alone
If I see you out the wars
Imma stab yo' ass
Whoop yo' ass
Ya fuck with me
I make ya handicap
And I pass the mic to my man Swifty
McVay he don't play

[Swift]
I'm Swifty McVay
Ya bastard out the blue
I'm hazard
I even haunt spirits that's after you
I'm cancerous with no answer
Pharmaceutic, I turn you allergic to being human
It ain't new
It's what I do when I'm feudin'
A sick nuisance
I have ya had
Until motherfuckers lookin' like Rick Rubin
What do you do to fools that think that they can take laughs?
Their face get sliced
And that's what's up
I inherit the power of all the rappers
I gotta be like Kruger
All them niggas bodies are coming out of me
I usually pack a Ruger
Now I see that I can be successful
By bruisin' yo chest
Without a thing
A professional
I'm a king that slaughtered kings
Exceptional, genetically raised by wolverines nigga
I give a fuck on what niggas seen
I'll send a fiend to pitifully raise you
And then convene bitch
That's what we do
Our crew D12
Rapping nigga
In take the Nina off the shelf
And I'm hazard for ya health
Like I said before
The type to walk the streets
And the five-o ignore
Me when they see me
Dog, I'll burn you like VD
And that's the way we be
Fuck you!

[Tim Westwood]
Easy, easy
I'm trying to hold a job down here
Yeah, yeah
I apologize if anyone's offended
You know tune out go to something else
Come back later
It's going down
It's real hip-hop
There's gonna be some swear words
Be prepared
Change the station if you ain't built

[Eminem]
Aftermath in the house now
Get yo' fricking mouth stabbed out
Y'all get so mad
Get so livid
Looking for dap from anyone who would give it
Now how you gon' value
Someone else's opinion
Cause you selfish
I'm rap's Elvis
Everybody try to grab the helm-ets and they hardhats
Run and duck for cover
Yo, fuck ya mother
What the fuck are ya?
Yo, I'm sprayin'
While I'm playin'
I ain't playin'
I'm sprayin' at your feet
Like hey Imma cock the hand
Imma pull my cock out
Outta my pajamas
And cock back the cock
Like it's chicken
Yo, check it out
The clock is ticking
It's countdown to Armageddon
And there's nothing you can do to stop it
Put your arm or head in
Or put a pen in it
But once the grenade pin is pulled
It's nothing you could do
But end up in the hospital
Yeah, yeah
Hospital, pital, 'spitals
End up in the 'spital
And y'all can eat my tender vittles
I don't really give a fudge
Fudge, fudge-packers
Is what y'all are
And y'all get smacked up
At the awards show
However you want it to go
We can make it go either way
Biatch
That's itch-bay backwards
F around and smack turds
They told us not to use no cuss words
So we gon' not use cuss words
And say busters instead
Have you all bleeding red
Damn, right out of yo' head
That's what I said
And my name ain't Fred
My name ain't special ed
And it ain't my birthday
But Proof can get on the mic in the worst way
And I don't even have to curse to say

[Proof]
Proof's a wolf
Grab ya pooper-scooper
Follow me
I fight to the death
Like Apollo Creed
I only hang with bitches that swallow seeds
Air Force Ones not Wallabees
Hollow tease
I be, rushin' colonies
I'm known by all blacks in hoods
Like collard greens
Last of a dyin' breed
Old school like Model Ts
When I ride on my rivalries
Like 2Pac writ
Put you in the I.C.U
With no eye sockets
More than five shots spit
So you can die hot bitch
It's only one topic
I need profit
Fuck the gossip
Harry the hype-writer
The night lighter
The only thing higher than Proof
Nigga is my lighter
I'm watchin' you fly niggas crash
Like Al-Qaeda
Crime fighter
Guess I rhyme by the mind tighter
Than the World Trade
Bit the jaws
Like Jay Dee
I put my fucking dick to broads
Broads, dog that's down on all fours
Of course I'm down to get yours
How come my niggas stop cold
When they heard capsule?
The rap flow is good
And they say that we fatsos
They gotta be this way
And we catch 'em with lassos
And how they feel about that?
Cause we breaking they cash flow
My niggas tell me right there
I ain't got no time
So know why fool
Dropped outta high school
Cause Slim said so
Now I'm back in this bitch
And I'm 'bout to ride this bitch
And this motherfucker rockin'
For Tim, asshole
I gotta do this shit right
Now Swift is on my left
So it's the way it is
Cause Shady in here
I'm 'bout to tell you niggas right now
Green is on the turntable
Why not do this shit daily, all year

[Stat Quo]
Hey doll, cheer
It's a grown man record
You don't want the pressure
This a grown man lecture
Sittin' on the dresser
Be a grown man bitch to her
Underneath my seat's a grown weather here
Peepin' my packer
He got grown man cheddar
Wheels, ransom notes, and checks
Are all grown letters
Hey doll, chill
Sit back relax, as I handle by biz
Green Lantern on the scratch
Attack the track wrong
Stat Quo doing his thing
The European awards was yesterday
Em won
Took the award home
D12, ya know what I mean
Shawty, be grown
Handle my business home
Doing my thing
Home alone
But not Macaulay Culkin
Stat Quo be the champion
Icon winner
Eat niggas like dinner
Me and Westwood, handlin' our beeswax
Green Lantern on the track
Doc Dre did it long time ago
Like this and like that
And uh
I'm motherfucking beast
Man uh
Pass it to Swifty Mc-V
And ain't no flick
To hear what my be sayin'

[Swift]
One-two, three to the four
Swifty with the four-four
Process of elimination is always complete
When I hit the streets
I wanna see who the biggest G
Hennessy don't do nothing but give you lumps
When you speakin' on us
Disrespect you be eatin' a bottle drunk
Turning you niggas all to monks
Red dots amongst ya foreheads
You get punctured once
Slump cowards with Ninas bitch
I mean it, how ya leanin'
Like the Tower of Pisa
Faces lookin' like pizzas
An animal instinct
I eat ya with cannibalistic procedures
Adam's apple some womens' fetuses
Me is just like special nature
I messed up, slurring my words off the liquor
And yes I hate to
See ya wack emcees
Step inside my face
And ya know my fo-fo (four-four) will clear the place
Ya runnin', I'm gunnin'
I'm stunnin' and it's fun when it happens
Especially when I'm rapping
I give dap to brothers I'm cool with
But yo know
You can't mess around with Swift
Ya just cool whip
Ya soft and ya sweeter than sugar
Dog, I'm just that type of nigga
That 'ill walk up on ya
Leave ya in a bed of blood
Huh, if ya tryna fuck with us
He said don't cuss
But I couldn't help it
I take my belt off whip ya wit'  it
Because I'm selfish
So I, just do the things I do
I freestyle for you
Then I pass it to my crew
Then they pass it back
And if ya wack
Then get slapped
For that type of

[Eminem]
Acid rap
Yeah and that's a fact
Slim Shady's back
Got eighty ladies layin' on they back
Yo, but I'm a mack
I'm a little nuts for Brittany
Little to sane for Whitney
Tell you the truth
Yo, Bobby would prolly get me
Catch me in the lobby
After he just hit me
After he sniffed three lines
He'd prolly knock out Fifty
He could prolly lift up both of us
And spin us both on both fingers like donuts
Yo, I party hard
But for real, I want Bobby Brown as my bodyguard
And that's for real
And that's the deal
Cause we got mass appeal
And I don't think that they can really take it
Cause I always let my nuts hang
Like I was doing push-ups naked
That's what I do
Is drink the Alizé and
Then I pass it to my man Proof and
Then we start goofin' around
And start spoofin'
Everybody, yo we in the party
And we could rock the party
And we could get it started
And if ya smell like (sniff)
Somebody farted
Or we can
We can do the Mardi Gardy
We could party harder
We could get started
What you wanna do
Proof, it's on you

[Proof]
It's on me
Might take it to the hip, homie

It's like Shady and Aftermath
We after cash
You want it
We gon' blast ya ass
(4x)

And listen, ya need to quit it dog
Cause Proof is low to the ground
Like midget balls
With them bridges falls
I lock ya ass up on the game
And I visit all
And it's like they signed
They said they did it all
Because they breeches small
But Imma tell you
In the likeness of the great 2Pac
I'm hot
And I'm fatter then Biggie Smalls
All y'all, need to recognize
Cause where I come from
It's still the East side
Over there by Dresden
Where we make their heads spin
Back then the back, ten
Make his ass backspin
This action of crack-skin
Nigga, I eat more Vicodin
Than the dots that's on the Pac-Man, board
Oh Lord
Give me my sword
On top of that
The freestyles I got you can't afford
But they free
Yo, they only cost attention
And did I mention
I'm a boss with henchmen
I send niggas to get ya
Yo, it's easy to do
How ya feel about this
Yo, the piece of the Proof
The piece of the clue
The pieces ya need
The pieces I got
On top of that my freestyle
Never stutter
My words are butter-rock
Like the niggas feel about us
I say precise
Nigga feel fucked up like D-Nice, did
For getting Scott La Rock slain
I rock 'caine and rock brains
Back in the day, when ya block came
Get ya block slain
Ya hood aborted
How I feel when they all get shortened
Haha
And I tell ya like this
Ya missing the ending
I lift ya whole hood
Like I'm fixing ya engine
Nigga, come on

[Stat Quo]
I keep my brim tilted
And tracked, I killed it
Atlanta, my city
I built it
Watch this
Young beast bob and weave
Young Stata (Status) make it hard to breathe
Please believe
I ball for cheese
Survival of the fittest
One of the trillest ever
Bow down, he severe
Finna lock the market
Marshall and Dre don' linked up
With the boy from the A
I am chillaxin'
Fine linen in my fashion
Bump yo' questions
Why you askin', anythang?
Niggas wanna know what I'm on
Riding on my enemies
Getting them gon' huh
A crime businesses
And you need homes
Something I can flip to increase my grip
Yo, why they on my dick?
Ride ya own lane
I gotta handle
Trust me lil' man
Ya need a little change
Here's for starters
I show ya how to come up
Work on martyr
Launder ya cheese
Do cash and beauty parlors
Hustle smarter
Green got me, haha
Green got me
Imma kill you Green

[Swift]
To me it's like second nature
I treat murders like a recreation
And these niggas steadily changing
They laughs like Mason
T.D. Jakes and all of these fake gangstas
They all be awaking
Because McVay can put a date on you homes
I'll engrave in ya tombstone
With urination
Now your whole funeral soon blown
Communication are for fools who be wasting time
Contemplating on making up
I ain't that guy
A grudge holder
I used to shove boulder in the counsel of my Aurora
Get caught and tell 'em it's yours
I can leave each one of ya body parts
Stranded in the middle of different forests
Having police ignore the shit
Niggas get hung like ornaments
While they hanging they trees
They get bombed like Vietnamese
In '46 or whatever year it was
I gotta buzz
And murdering you is all I love
This is Swifty McVay
I ain't by myself
I got Em, Proof, and Stat that be hot
And D12 is over, D12 is over here
And yo' death is near
And that's what's up

[Eminem]
That's what's up
Pass this cup
And then we blast you up
Freestyle right off the massive truck
We got truckloads
And uff, no
Cuff no and spin it backwards
And play it back later
Cause all y'all haters rockin' gators
Alligators, we see ya later
We ain't player haters
But yo check it out
We rockin' in our Navigators
And we can sit back
And we can stretch, we can check
Trek, I mean catch, anything
And we can fetch
I'm slurring a little bit
But during the part that I was doing
The urination, upon that girl and
Wait a minute, I ain't goin'
There with my rap
I ain't tryin' to be starting no crap
But yo, I be flowin'
With the stuff and I be knowin'
That when I start raking out them leaves
I be hoein'
And that's six in the mornin'
And we can do it
We can get it on until the crack of dawn and
We can get it on with Tim Westwood
We can do whatever you want
Bring ya best cause
We do what we want to do
On this microphone
Cause we ought to know
Or ought to inform you
That we get warm too warm
Sometimes we too hot to
Not to spit this ish
Spit it backwards and that said shit
Whoops, I didn't mean to curse
But yo Proof, come back
And lay one verse

[Proof]
I don't bite
But I spit the killin' venom
When I'm older
My pockets gon' blow up like Brazilian women
You can fight me here
Like some Big (B.I.G.) and Pac shit
Breaking laws off him dog
And hypnotic, he got it
Although he sound sober
I ain't gay nowhere near gay
I even hate a brown-noser
It's over, he killa
Got no skills
When these twenty-two spins
Ain't got nothing to do with Diablo wheels
Even the bible kills
I burn moral themes
Y'all pop like MTV
And talk more than Coral Jeanne
The poor foreseen that there is a God
I hope you guys slack
Cause when I lean back
Without the Terror Squad
I gotta two bigger
Then pistol move niggas whip
I leave fool ass lit
Like a cool cigarette
I'm 'bout the peace dude
In fact the peaceful
Since these niggas know my piece full
And since they watchin' Beef too
They watchin' niggas out here
They see how we go
Back in the day
With what, my people
The desert eagle
Leaving people living in deceased holes
How they feel about that?
My truck is all diesel
Freeze hoes
These people know it
G.L. in detail
They break like Lee nail
Crew is D12
More noise than a seashell
Cause we shall prevail
Without the Martin Luther King drill

[Eminem]
How you know the main side, so attraction
Psycho action
The man 'ill throw up on Michael Jackson
Sick enough to do anything
In any video
I could even pull out my whole titty yo
Wouldn't mean a damn thing
Wouldn't mean nothing
Like if you went and pulled hamstring
Cause you a fake 'iatch
I took the b off
Cause Imma be off with the switch
Just like you
Cause you walk with a switch too
That's what I meant
Cause I represent, every single day
Pass it off to Stat

[Stat Quo]
I'm so slum
I pull up in a double-quad deuce with no roof
On them big ass boots
White tee, no suit
Just me and my troop
Jam and be some hustlers
We are not a group
Grizzles, love me cause my smile is priceless
My advice, my life
I have them wetter than diapers
She want me to buy big jewels and wife her
Fuck the bitch tonight
But tomorrow won't like her
Go back to the club
And get a new one like her
And that's what I call completing a cypher
Wrassle with the bitches so they call me Roddy Piper
When a Stat come through
Your girlfriend get hyper

[Swift]
You be in the ocean with the worms and maggots
I'm what overdoses do for an addict
And after static with me
Holy ghosts will be given a homes
Automatically, it's either that or be rolled in a hole
I target ya dome
Watch that shit get blown
Like a head gasket
See I'm rabid
And known to foam acid
I accurately mastered battering bastards
I don't get charged for assault and battery
They be after me
Cause I smashed 'em
Happily answering
Any nigga that asks me would happen
I tell 'em the truth laughin'
That's just me
A five-star general
With aura that's horrible
I be smackin' ya captain
Turn a corpse into ya corporal
They won't know who did it
Tell your lieutenant
When an arsenal is set
For all of those threats of coming close
No you won't
With a Stephen King mentality
Ya don't believe me?
I can bring the casualty to ya family
And that's what's up
I got D12 in the house
Ya know what we about
Are you a man, a mouse?
And it seems like you a mouse
Running in that hole
Just cause you hoe
And everybody know
McVay yeah

[Proof]
See I'm going out
Blow 'em up
They wanna see me, what I'm all about
Pull 'em out
I'm in the club
Got the snub
'Bout to bust it out
Boy hear me, 'bout to hear me
'Bout to cuss a dog
I can't take it

[Eminem]
Can't cuss it dog
Take it dog
Ayo, get with the
With the girl
Better take it off
She got the bra better shake it y'all
Ayo, check it out
I'm about to bull
And wreck it out

[All]
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels

[Eminem]
You gon' make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Tim you gon' make us freestyle for all

[All]
Freestyle forever
Freestyle forever
Freestyle forever

[Eminem]
Tim gon' make us freestyle forever



How the fuck he got an Oscar
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of K-Mart plaza
Across from the Red Lobster
Looking like the Loch Ness Monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap, it costs less to gossip
I'll probably be a lot less hostile
If you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes
You'll get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy yeah, both ears and ha yes nostrils
At the OzzFest with Nas
Bumping Das EFX in a wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket
They cost less
I'm a hot mess
Cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasps nest in the process, awesome
Drunk as fuck, one sock
Pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking Hydroxycuts
And four oxi’s stuck in my esophogus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screaming "serves you right you cocky fuck
That's what you get for mocking us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was"
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
Said it was a sock puppet
So no strings attached
You can all suck it
Chicka get it, ah fuck it
Shit’s bout to get as hairy as motherfucking Chewbaca's nuts
Cocksuckas



[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Ryan's a homicidal misfit, I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Verse 6: Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling "Go Shady!" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over

[Outro: Eminem & Yelawolf]
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
Game over!



[1st verse]
What you got? what you want? what you like? what you need?
Who you with? I don't give a shit, you come leave here with me
What's my name? You know that, what's yours? Never mind
Girl get ya behind in my ride and let's glide on 24's
I'm up in the club with a bottle of bub
Got a model and I double up, and you know it's like that
They wanna give a nigga the goods, wanna give the goodies up
And make for a night cap, tell me what excite that
With that nice ass, make a nigga say "gon' girl"
Make a nigga wanna put you on chrome, take a bitch home
Get it on toes curl, why don't come and hop in O's world
Got the old school parked in the back where the gats at
Where the yack's at, access, got 'em on the way to the mattress
Pass that, toting hey in the vehicle, two broads with no bras
No draw's, no flaws, nope no law, I dips out in the car like what?

[Hook]
Got a gang of bitches, getting them riches, sitting on 24's
Living that life those, that chrome always rolling different from yours
Slow ya role, you know them po po love to get a nigga in a Chevrolet fo' do'
But I get so low, so low low, so low on them ho's

[2nd verse]
Dipping through the hood on them thangs with a full tank
Gotta pull rank, with my hand on that 45, fuck what a fool think
Try to take a nigga life when the night come, I'mma light some up like a flare gun
Nine millimeter bare bellum, holding a melon, nigga at the right one
Now a niggas on the right hunt, got a nice type honey and we into seeing ice and
Bitches wanna get the right come, Trice is the type that lay pipe like python
Parrallel to a pipe line, carousel kinda clockwise, switch 'em in and outta my ride
Get you for them inches I got, hop in the 350 block, let's roll

[Hook]

[3rd verse]
Hop in the tre-nickle-o-six-four, AC blow, you be nice and cold
Ice on my neck like zero below, she zero in on O, nigga froze a ho
Pedal to the medal, we off to the mo', bitch get sentimental, fuck the ho
Got an issue, he ain't gon' miss you, gotta shit slew of bitches, wishing to fit ya shoes
Ridiculous how I give 'em exit wounds, disrespect, singing an O sex tune
That's a bet, better yet, Dev is next, get her in the bed and her head is Pez
Best believe that I'm wearing the dress, panties wet, got her in the fanny yep
Fuck it at the rest stop, getting head in the candy Lac on camera
Parked in a motherfuckin handicap

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
(I can't keep chasing you
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it, now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left
I laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?
Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's…

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
(Can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
‘Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a
Mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people
Who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you
My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just...

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life



[Verse 1 Redman]

Try to O.K. Corral with Doc and Meth Tical, Bar saloon fight, without weapons out (YEE-HAH!!), Strech marks, like belly on Kevin Lous, One yard to score, only second down, Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down, Tryin to lock cash, Bitch better bounce, Boyfriend jump in, Meth shut him down, Pound to echo loud, bout seven miles, Doc, Dirty Jersey hunt em down, Uncut, rhymes won't even fit the file, Baddest man out the bunch, pick him out, Drunk with a gun, miss you hit the crowd, Snitches, someone kiss to stitch your mouth, Wilder then winos on liquor droughts, Mrs. Howell, Mary-Ann, dig em out, Ginger watch, with the gun in Skipper mouth, Love Da Ruckus, and love to
Dish it out!

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]

Shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam shimmy ya, Gimme the mic so I can take it away, Off on a natural charge bon-voyage, Yeah from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad, Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm, Rain on your college-ass disco dorm, For you to even touch my skill, You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill, Now chop that down, pass it all around, Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground, For any emcee in any fifty two states, I get psycho, killer, Norman Bates, My producer slam my flow is like bam, Jump on stage ah then I dip down! (See my name is the ODB, and I'll beat your ass!)

[Eazy-E]

Now everything's good in my hood, And it's on and poppin', Eazy-muthaphukkin'-E from east side south Compton, Straight givin' up the real, On how a nigga feel talk that shit, mothafuckers' caps get peeled, Layin' low in the cut, Gettin' high than a motherfucker, Niggas know what's up, I'm that gangsta-gangsta, Is that what they're still yellin', Nigga G to a T saggin' and bailin', Live by the gun, you know what I'm sayin', Ren? (Yeah), So I guess I'll die by that motherfucker then, So when I die, niggas bury me, Make sure my shit reads Eazy-muthaphukkin'-E, And it's a fact, to be exact, my tombstone should read, 'He put Compton on that map', And that's how a nigga feel, When I'm givin' up the motherfuckin' real!

[Biggie]

Big Poppa, throwing niggas off of cliffs, smoking spliffs, Disappear with my bitch in a Mitsubishi Eclipse, Read my lips, I kill you, Blood'll spill too, did I say thank you, I grant you three wishes cause I be the genie, Niggas is assed out like fat bitches in bikinis, Read between the lines see what I see, I see the diary of a sick bastard, Junior Mafia blaster, Rugers on the hips, Bought coke to flip chips, bought slugs to fill clips, Flipping coke in corner store bodegas, In the back room playing Sega, Street Fighter II, I'm inviting you, bring your writing crew and they dopest rhymes, I get up in that ass every time, Lyrically I'm untouchable, uncrushable, Getting mad blunted in the 600, Benz, ask your friends who's the illest, Licking shots, niggas screaming "Biggie Smalls tried to kill us", Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin' Bucktown, MAC-11 cocked back, niggas better duck down, Face down, you know the routine, the cream, earrings, You know the drama Biggie bring, let's get it on!

[Method Man]

Here comes the ruckus, the motherfuckin ruckus, Thousands of cut-throats and crumb-snatchin fuckers, Straight from the brain, I'll be givin you the pain, anger, Comin from the 36th Chamber, Bang!, Tical, hittin with the Buddha-Fist style, Shotgun slammin in your chestpiece, plow!, Brain is blown all over the terrain, Like a man without no arms you can't hang, Time for a change of the guard, You've been arrested for lyric fraud now you barred, For real, check it, I pull strings like B.B. King on guitar, I'm the true Fist of the North Star!

[Busta Rhymes]

Hold your breath, We swing it from right to left, Word to Wyclef, You know my shit be hot to death, Staying alive, you know only the stronger survive, Holding my heat, I under my seat , wippin the five, Baseline for all of my people movin around, Give me a pound, All of my niggas holdin it down, Cuttin' you up, The new shit wrekin you up, fucking' you up, My black hole suckin you up, Back in the days nigga use to be assed out, Now a brother holdin several money market accounts, Blaze the street and then I would just like to announce, Feelin my grove, My jiga jiga makin you bounce, Others is fare, me and my squad breakin the bread, Straight gettin it, we got you suckers holdin your head, Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us, You strange to us that's when we gettin dangerous!

[2 Pac]

How should I plead? Forever thuggin' on a quest to get G's, Runnin' from enemies ever since the days of a seed, I'm under pressure, the stress will have me drinkin', Thinkin' niggas after me, much too paranoid to blink, Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin' G's, They after a playa, but I won't let 'em capture me, I gotta thank the Lord for the weed and the nicotine, I can't sleep, close my eyes, I see wicked things, I keep my pistol by my bedside, one in the chamber, Preoccupied with homicide, my life's in danger, Rollin' down the 405, beware of stangers, Hand on my 4-5; that's what the fame does, I'm probably wrong, but I'll never know it till I'm gone, From out the gutter where the jealous motherfuckers roam, Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me, Before the penitentiary, let's get it on!

[Eminem]

You're bout to see peace destroyed, it'll never be restored, When I unleash these beastly hordes on your CD stores, Wanna stop it, You gon' need a priest, at least three swords, A license to ill from the Beastie Boys, Three Ouija boards, a squeegee, and please be warned, Don't ask what the squeegee's for, Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors, Eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns, And as for me, you ask when I'm gone, will he be mourned, Is puke lukewarm, Should Casey Anthony do porn, Can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a fricking shoebox with a shoehorn, Smothered in chloroform, so she can go get her groove on, Can she duct tape and Velcro a fetus, Joell, yo, tell Joe I need his empty box from his old shell toed Adidas, So I can put these babies in a fetal position, They're getting elbows to the penis, Yeah, big deal, I took some little kid's Big Wheel and spit in his frickin' big kids meal, Quit tryin' to bite me and pinch, you wench, sit still; did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz windshield, Is it dust we 'bout to kick up, Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup, Between his stick shift in his frigging pickup, And drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will 'til he gets hicc-ups, Flipping the script up, Like Mike Vick getting bit in his junk by a Pit, yup, I'm a sick pup, I'd be a horrible magician, cause I'd fuck a trick up, Fix your lips up to say something fly, or zip up, Aye, B, let's see: you said you were gonna do X-Y-Z, 'Til you fuck around and get dropped, Like an E when you add an I-N-G, Don't put a K in front of that though when I MC, Cause I'm not the king of this microphone booth, It's more like a phone booth, Superman in this bitch, Kryptonite won't do, It gives me more power, I bump the Fat Boys and eat rat poison, take meteor showers, Fresh outta the mental hospital, And me not flossing a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit'll be like Nas doing gospel or R&B, You crazy, Me pushing up daisies, that thought is impossible, As if flashing across the news, Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute, With a huge johnson, boobs and a monstrous tube of lube, And a bra, some boots, Some panties and an aqua blue Mazda, Swallowing a popsicle, playing tonsil pool, So kill the rumors, it ain’t happening, I’ma rap 'til I'm fossil fuel!



[Hook: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see
Man, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm
The freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats, boy
I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus
My soul's thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your woman
Just to keep my lyrics comin' (bitch)
We elevated to new heights, premeditated
Let it be that I stated, they hate it
Now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it, that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick, all you so called hard MCs would not be impotent, but pimpin' it
And actin' like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's rock the bells, and you's a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep comin'
Like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah, I got somethin' for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all runnin' past the gates
And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on, like an appliance
Defiance? No, we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well, I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own
With the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So, stop that bullshit flow, yo
You need to come with the real skills and act like you know

[Hook: Eminem & Eye-Kyu]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
You don't know shit, so when you see one, flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain round the block to jog your fuckin' memory
It's either them or me, man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner
Than Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite
And wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs, and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours, let's see what you got
But don't front, and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick
Jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack

[Hook: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?

[Intro]
There is no escaping (Yo)
There's no place to hide (Ayo)
You scream, "Someone save me!" (Yo)
But they don't pay no mind (Ayo)
Goodnight, goodbye!

[Verse 1]
You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again—not again!

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, "I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun"
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause…

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Outro]
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
(Evil… rise)
(Evil… rise)



[Hook: Skam & Eminem]
Yo, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day, three-six-five a year
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't tryin' to hear (Fuck that!)
Bustin' lyrics in the air, keepin' some up in the chamber
(Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin'?) Man, I'm releasin' anger!
I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day, three-six-five a year
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear
Spittin' lyrics in your ear, keepin' some up in the chamber
Ayo Shady, what the fuck you doin'? (I'm releasin' anger!)

[Sample: Harry Sinclair]
You know what they're saying about you, don't you? You've got funny in the head! A real bloody weirdo!

[Verse 1: Skam & Eminem]
Man I'm tired of bein' tired, every time I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein' late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin', and endin' up datin' sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin' bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin', girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear, spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb this shit in damn near a year
Side burn zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the last ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin' up white rappers like I'm throwin' gang signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin' the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
'Cause in Miami, the baby jammin' like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin'?)

[Hook: Skam & Eminem]
Man, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day, three-six-five a year
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't tryin' to hear (Fuck that!)
Bustin' lyrics in the air, keepin' some up in the chamber
(So what the fuck you doin', then?) Man, I'm releasin' anger!
I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day, three-six-five a year
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear
Spittin' lyrics in your ear, keepin' some up in the chamber
Ayo Slim, what the fuck you doin'? (Dawg, I'm releasin' anger!)

[Bridge: Brad Pitt]
I've been trying to figure something in my head, and maybe you can help me out, yeah? When a person is insane, as you clearly are, do you know that you're insane? Maybe you're just sitting around, reading Guns & Ammo, masturbating in your own feces, do you just stop and go, "Wow! It is amazing how fucking crazy I really am!"?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit changed
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive 'til you screamin' to be extinguished
'Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin'
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin'
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin' your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that, back to lovers' lane
To the night you was thought up and cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

[Hook: Skam & Eminem]
Yo, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day, three-six-five a year
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't tryin' to hear (Fuck that!)
Bustin' lyrics in the air, keepin' some up in the chamber
(Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin'?) Man, I'm releasin' anger!
I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day, three-six-five a year
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear
Spittin' lyrics in your ear, keepin' some up in the chamber
Ayo Em, what the fuck you doin'? (Man, I'm releasin' anger!)



[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crobar to pry her apart with

[Verse 3]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!



[Intro (background "WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!")]

If you don't back the fuck up, and get the fuck up off the flo'
My crew is takin' over as soon as we hit the do'
You hit the door, but we comin' in and you goin' home
Security, they can't even stop us because they know
Runyon Avenue soldiers hold us down wherever we go
Chuggin' on our 40s and holdin' up .44s
We come with toasters like we just opened savings and loans
And we don't need your brew tonight, homie, we brought our own
So grab whatever you sippin' on and let's get it on!

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
We deep as a motherfucker, we 'bout to get it crunk
You just another punk in the club about to get jumped
I settle my vendettas with AK's, Berettas
We don't 'posed to be in here with our weapons, but still they let us
Switchblade, brass knuckles, nickel plated belt buckle
Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble
Elbows flyin', bitches cryin', niggas bleedin', you retreatin'
Run into your car and skatin' off, we G'ing
We make example out of you haters runnin' your mouth
You the reason why your peoples is pourin' they 40s out
Dirty Dozen wildin', beat niggas bloodied
And you gon' have to pour out a keg for all your homies

[Hook]

Pour your 40 out (Bitch!)

[Verse 4: Proof]
I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk
80 Proof on this vodka, that's the name I want
I'm in the club to beef, you gotta murder me dead
Only talk to a bitch with burgundy hair
Or the aisle in the 'Vette, bumpin' Seven-Deuce
See that top on that 40, you know it's comin' loose
See me on the ave daily, be runnin' this shit
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch
Packin' mags and clips, I'll smash your clique
Because of Proof they put the "G" in the alphabet
Smokin' weed, drinkin' Henny, Remy, and that Jimmy
Don't worry if we run out, the corner store got plenty

[Hook]
Pour your 40 out (Guzzle it)
Pour your 40 out (Guzzle it)

[Verse 1]
(Aight, aight...Uh...Slim Shady...Yo, yo, yo...)
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board

[Verse 2]

Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg

[Verse 3]
(Like this, like that, like this
Like this, like that, like this)
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments

Shit, why not? Blow your brain out

Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Verse 4]
Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)



[Verse 1: Eminem]
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you goddamn right I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink
He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And is no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk
Crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and send up the river
I shiver when I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly she began lowering my self-esteem
She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream n' holla
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do? Call her out on it, we just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover



[Verse 1: Shabaam Shadeeq]
Of course, I rap 'til I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them jive turkey MC's
Say what you like, I toss
Your theory, when you hear me like the guts of a dutch
Snap caught you in the act, like Vivitar AF
2-5-5 Autofocus, clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the calvary, mic brutality
Switch the pitch gradually
Aqua, turn-table knocka, fresh like Binaca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles, remarkable styles
Made an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics, mechanicals and phat rhymes
They know the time, like a sundial, I'm X-File

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Went to Bible class with a gun, blasted a nun
Fuck Hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born, I was hatched
And dumped in the trash, with a note attached
Saying "Someone please whip this brat's ass!"
I never gave a rat's ass or a flyin' fuck
Drivin' drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes, skiddin' out, ‘cause the tires suck
Went to pull you off my dick and got the pliers stuck
You better run, ‘cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife
And stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded
I missed my sanity since the night we departed

[Verse 3: Skam]
Yo, Old World Disorder on some outnumber shit
We'd rather go out of control than to be under it
Yo, how you gonna win against us
When we got nothin' to lose?
Must be confused, or prayin' to a God that don't exist
It wouldn't save your Bible-kissin' asses even if he did
We like to twist your mystic
Genetic dead-end, don't got friends
Skam and Shadowman, posting children for depression
Stress in any language, say my name in Spanish
That's "Chupacabra", suck the life out of you
There won't be enough of your brain left to fill a teaspoon
We two vanishing men that make the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

[Hook sample]
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."

[Verse 4: A.L.]
When it comes to beef, I gets relief when I kill and breathe
Send a wreathe, get your family ready for the grief
I'll knock your teeth; take your seat, like a thief
Make you change your beliefs
Burn a leaf before you go beneath
Rappers, I kill 'em, down to Hell is where I send 'em
Feelin' my pen is illin' so much I need some penicillin
Jams I'm spillin', ‘cause I'm bound to it
Kicking shit that's solitaire
Your crown I rip, ‘cause rappers, you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips, if you play hard
You stay scarred thinkin' you're braveheart
You're in a graveyard, one in a mil, son
I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed or catch a dum-dum in your grill
Rappers diminishin', in scrimmage
I'm good to the finish, I'll speak in English
While your brothers are speakin' in gibberish
You touch the mic and I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame? I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price, say they nice, when they play the dice
I'll take your life, slay you twice, before you break your rights

[Verse 5: Kwest Tha Madd Lad]
Cats who rap are feminine
I'm sendin' this without the benefits
Of cinema scents of cinnamon
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to stencil simple sentences
A sentence is simple, you banned from using writin' utensils
Whether crayon, pen or pencil
Observe verse packed with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
Send a rap-shot to jaw with a crack and thwack
Send them whack-men back
To the lab to add what most of them lack
I can hand you a manual
To make what I plan to do more tangible
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sand granules
Scan the land and the blue sea annually
And you will see which animals eat amphibians
From spittin' up that written stuff; it’s all the same
It’s the reason for cyphers prematurely spittin' up
Ironic, phonics show my flow is far from ambionic
To be honest, no hits of chronic in my bionic, I'm beyond it
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor
Skeptics greet me exceptional when I bless sound receptacles
Much stretchin' through my vestibules
Turns crews to vegetables
They grab my testicles and cup 'em
Fuck 'em, bless 'em—Who? What?

[Hook sample]
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."



[Intro: Eminem]
Good morning!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Are y'all with us or what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, BITCH!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me having my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips, to ever kiss ass squished
I just can't get passed these little pissants
That wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it, 'cause we can
And they can't spit, and they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-hop isn't a sport, anymore when you gotta go and
Resort back into that shit maybe I'm old-fashioned
But my passion, is to smash anyone rapping
Without having to slap him, believe me
I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
When I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how
Far it gets took on the mic 'cause I'm telling you right now
You're not gonna like it, 'cause if I
Get pushed over the edge, then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a Pit Bull, you get bit, B
Your words stick to you, like crazy glue when you diss me
'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing, and you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone like Keith Murray, when he threw his stool
And hit a girl accidentally, I do this for Swifty
Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof - are you with me?

[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

[Verse 2: Swifty]
They consider me the, epitome of a beef starter
In the party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs, they hot son, better not run (AHH!)
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust
To whoever ain't cautious, In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death prophet, you'll stop breathing
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading, when you meet me
Better speak like it's Seasons Greetings, either that
Or we'll be beefing frequent, niggas need an E just to speak shit
Your leader's a petite bitch, keep the heater where you can reach quick
I'll snipe you with it, and won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it, from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks sway, you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I heard you niggas don't like us but so what
This beef is like what the fuck, did he say in his rap?
Em, I can see that he just a punk, I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me
Pleased when seeing guts, I don’t need no enemies
Just my family, a couple trucks, and my MPC and a mic
They empty out on them bike to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say: "Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!"
WHAT! I might as well give this up but that'd be, selfish as fuck
To leave D12 in this but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON!

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach, and when they want it I'll bring
A hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin' if you coming

[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning



[Intro]
It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 3]
You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)



[Parking Lot Rapper #2 (Obie Trice)]
[?] use my voice to spit the fiery frame
Try and refrain, dying in vain
Soon as I reply in [?]
I be the nigga in the Shelter who be eyeing your chain

[Parking Lot Rapper #3 (Njeri Earth)]
Three-one-three area, bound to bury ya with vengeance
My rhymes sentences'll put an end to your existence with the rigorousness
Niggas, I'm serious, delirious, cause a curious... pause
The fury calls from my jaws from devouring y'all raw

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
You forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical
The Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual
Syllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexing you
With words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you
Murder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two
Let my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Your style is generic, mine's authentic made
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
My technique's bizarre and ill; I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya, that’s all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You wanna battle? You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute, I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style's like mustard without the Heinz’s
I lead the new school, you're a Busta without the rhymes
I crush the shit out your line

[Sol George (Omar Benson Miller)]
Now I'm the Rashiki smoking the lick licky
Ten freaky girls inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimping ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl, say what up doe
Ten freaky girls, ten, ten, ten freaky girls

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

[Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie)]
Yo...



[B-Rabbit]
...

[Supa Emcee]
Hey yo, What up, trailer trash!

Yo Future, how'd you get whitey to battle the Savior
That's like Darth Vader battling Obey Taylor
You can't mess around with the horror
I grab the mic and Ima murder you, now you'll die tomorrow!
You can't kick with the lyrics I spit
I blow your head off and leave you dying in your blood, you bitch!
You still a trick and a hoe and Ima roll
I fucked your mama; she's a prostitute bro!
You thinking you white, but you ain't light
Ima murder you in the gang again, and blast you in de night!
Im still ill, I'm still for real with Ken Loraine;
I got a gun on your boy, Ima blow out his brain!
You run with a bunch of whack faggots
Ima eat out your meat like I'm in your body; I'm a maggot!
And yo matter of fact, you gettin' played
You ain't nothing but a white-boy dying of fucking aids!



[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Cheddar, I can rip you to a shred a
Cheddar cheese, there's not a better MC than me
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, what am I, so what if I
Cut a guy, did I s-s-stutter guy
Leave you punch drunk from lunch truck to Shelter
You never felt the wrath or felt the skelter, melt ya
Got the belt for the welterweight champ
You got in with a fake stamp
Garbage bag full of clothes, still pullin' hoes
Rip you from head to toe, from leg to bullet hole
Next gun pull it slow
And aim at the Free World 'fore you let it go
Instead of "Oh, I just shot my dick head"
And yes, you do got a big head
I can't call it, Cheddar where's your wallet?
You're so drunk, you can outdrink the alcoholics
Make 'em say "Damn, Cheddar's the man
He needs a can surgically removed from his hand"



[D'Phuzion]
Yo, B-Rabbit
This silly rabbit don’t like lettuce I heard he like dicks
Faggot niggas, with ponytails and lipstick
I'm for real; don’t give a fuck, what
What, ohh
It’s like this; east side is where I'm from
You got beef hit me on the streets with a badge and a gun
Fuck the badge; I'm coming through with black mags
'Bout to do this B-Rabbit nigga 'cause he's a fag
Like I said earlier in the clause
I stated that in my, oh shit

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
A'ight look
I can see that I’m put to the test
Battling this chick, with no breasts
And why I gotta battle a chick
Especially one that’s whack, wit' a dick?
So you a dope MC?
Don’t get mad, start taking' your period out on me
‘Cause I ain’t done shit to you
What’s your name, Diffusion? Well then I guess I gotta diffuse you
This ain’t something I’m used to
Why the fuck did Future even introduce you?
I really don’t understand
Why this chick is up here right now and wants to be a man
On this mic it’s rat-a-tat-tat
Why the fuck am I standing here battling Da Brat?
You don’t really even wanna see this
On this microphone I will eat your fucking fetus
Yo



I know this girl
Her name is Lily
And it's past her bed
T-I-M-E
She goes to sleep
And she can just dream
And not have to be
In a stinky trailer with me
So when I feel blue
Don't know what to do
I look at you
And I just say *Raspberry Noise*



[Lotto (Nashawn 'Ox' Breedlove)]
Yo, I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me
The shit is a horror flick, but the black guy doesn't die in this movie
Fuckin' with Lotto? Dawg, you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gon' feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joinin' the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck "Lotto," call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from 'Leave It To Beaver'
I used to like that show, now you got me in fight-back mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends okay
So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you", but "Have a nice day!"

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
"Blah-badi-boo-blah, bah-badi-bloo-blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said: "Hippity hoopla!"
Is that a tank-top or a new bra?
Look! Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boobjob
Didn't you listen to the last round, meathead?
Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said
Matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
And don't come back until somethin' dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you
Tank-top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far the white jokes get you
Boys like, "How Vanilla Ice gon' diss you?"
My motto: "Fuck Lotto!"
I get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow



[Lyckety Splyt (Strike)]
This guy's a choke artist, you'll catch a bad one
You're better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbing up this mountain, you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you're the new kid on the block
'Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fucking Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you looking foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
'Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his ass crack
And when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turning in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies
Talkin' 'bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race
He can't get with me, spitting this shit wickedly
Lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'ma turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile



[Marv Won]
Yo, yo, y'all ready for death? Y'all ready for death?
Marv Won, the Fat Killer
The game done got ugly, let's go, yo, yo
I seen your type before, you think you're tough
Battle you? Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up
In a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back
You can't fuck with me, man, really, just face facts
It's him versus me in a battle of ten rounds
It's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown
Dumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok
Come in the club drunk as fuck
Slap your bitch so we can buck
One hook... type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf
Tryin' to take his ear off, like Mike Tys
I'm quite nice on fight nights
And why he poppin' shit? Man, I thought he liked life
Apparently not, I'm incoherently hot
And if I miss you then your parents get shot
Yo, I'm a bad boy, bitch, it's on
I'll put 44's on your chest like you're Rick Mahorn

[B-Rabbit]
Hold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on
Don't think for a minute I'ma let you
Get away with that song
'Cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'
As a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
And I know it wasn't for me
Surely, you really must adore me
Now, look it… yo, you might as well move  to Italy
Look, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* – literally
You don't wanna really fuck with this
On this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus
But I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap
And turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap
And your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband
Fuckin' with this style, you're a dead man
I ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up
Just like your face when I had to rip it up
You don't wanna see me, yo, uh



[Maurice Grant]
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam Johny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy runnin', like haulin' ass
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption nigga don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up
Burnin' you down
Leavin' you ground tore up
From the pressure
Wanna frown
Don't want the nigga known pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck back-break this nigga

[B-Rabbit]
Yo
Check it out
Look, look
Yo, I gotta flow
I'm from the Mo, you ain't Detroit, hoe
Talkin' about seven mile, change your style
I read your bio, you're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this
Motherfuckin' rhyme, yo chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg, I'ma set the mic right here



[Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie)]
Your lyrics are shitty like when I cop a squat
Who told ya you can fuck with the mighty Papa Doc
For steppin' on the stage I should've rocked ya knot
And don't get too close or ya might get shot
You need to call ya momma and tell her to come get ya
And if she knew him she could bring her midget pops with her
I put a hole on your head like a 12 gauge
Lookin' like Kris Kross jiggity jumped your ass on stage
'Cause I'm a grown man son, I'll slaughter you
Make yo mom wish that her fat ass aborted you



[50 Cent]
Yeah.. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-UNIT!

[Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
I'm wide awake but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death waits for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through Mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, Papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggas hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Chi Chi, get the yayo"
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustling backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you moving forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third

[50 Cent]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my M-1 shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain"
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin' good
Or cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, lets get it poppin'

G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit!



[Intro: Jay Z]
Yeah, Renegade is back
Em, the beat is sick!
It's Young, Freeway, 8 Miles, let's go!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs
But I can rewind the calendar back
Back when it was now or nothin'
People said I would amount to nothin'
That I had talent for nothin'
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
I could just hear the folks now, "He got what he had comin'."
Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smilin'
Wanting somethin', claiming that they done somethin' for him
Got their Jay Z pom poms and their Hov uniform
Claiming they been runnin'
And tellin' everybody, like Martin Lawrence
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claiming that they threw it up before I threw it up
You what? Where was you before I blew this up?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up
Back on the block, getting it in, there wasn't no you with us

[Hook: Jay Z + Freeway]
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs

[Verse 2: Freeway]
6 miles and runnin' in the Pontiac six thousand eighty six
Trans might shift while the engine run
Anyone tell your honor: "Give me one more chance."
And them smokers screaming, "One more gram!"
So I'ma bring 'em one
Only son to my pop, stick close to my mama
Keep toasters for drama, make Salat with my son
My son growin' and he learnin' a lot
That's when them toasters, when the burners will pop
Brain on your, um–brella, a nigga, tell 'em niggas
That's like the Biblical scripture
Look back, turn to salt, like the sinners
Most of your heartless and self-centered
Like Meshach and Mesha
Set up your brother ‘cause you jealous, nigga
The heat back, like you never left
I ever rep, cops watch every step
Six miles and runnin', dodgin' every trap
The rap gingerbread man
Cherish every precious breath, state P the second gat

[Hook: Jay Z + Freeway]
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Back when nobody would find he had talent
Nobody would sign me
Nobody believed in me, nobody but Mommy blindly
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothing but love for me
When niggas would one me, the industry shunned me
That's why I'm taking all the industry's money
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
Young is the illest, Free is the future
Beans and Bleek is right now, we can see y'all 8 miles, nigga

[Hook: Jay Z + Freeway]
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs



[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Well, Jimmy moved in with his mother
'Cause he ain't got no place to go

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Buss it, buss it, 'cause
You live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Uh, break it down, uh

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
Well, my name is Jimmy, his name's Greg Buehl
Me, him and you we went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He's tappin' my mom we're almost the same age
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot, mom
Here, happy birthday, Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it
A 1928 Delta
This shit won't even get me to The Shelter
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
'Cause I'm back in the 810 now

'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you



[Vanessa (Miz-Korona)]
Man, I’m gettin' so sick and tired of fuckin' with this steel
They only give us 30 minutes to eat lunch and chill
My body achin' just to get a buck
I’m sick of eatin' this shit off this fuckin' lunch truck
Nasty-ass food, I’m in a nasty-ass mood
I should’ve called in sick, shit, I had somethin' to do

[Mike (Xzibit)]
I can’t believe that I’m hearing all this ravin' and rantin'
From Vanessa up in here at the New Detroit stampin'
You need to get your food and take your ass back to work
You're dreamin' if you think them corny-ass raps will work
Look at y’all standin' out here, freezin' like dumb fucks
Rappin' away for food off this ragedy lunch truck
Who want what? Who pumped up to get rolled up?
I spit venom in every direction, soak some up
Look at this fat-ass nigga, sloppy sucker
You're a ugly motherfucker, your pop should’ve wore a rubber
Stop rhymin', keep your day job, Vanessa
Next time leave that bullshit home on the dresser
Speaking of dresses, take a look at Paul the fruitcake
When you travel you probably pack panties in your suitcase
Made out of lace from Victoria’s secret
If ten men came in a cup you’d probably drink it

[Jimmy (Eminem)]
Okay, folks, enough with the gay jokes
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, hey lo'
This guy's a doo-doo
You've worked here longer than me
And I get paid more than you do
Dawg, take a seat
What’s this guy standing in line for? He ain’t got money to eat!
Check this out, yo yo
This guy cashed his whole check and bought one ho-ho
Fuckin' homo! Little maggot
You can’t hack it; Paul’s gay, you're a faggot
At least he admits it, don’t even risk it
This guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
I don’t know what they told you, Mike
You must had them cornrows rolled too tight
This job, you wanna quit, but you can’t
You’ve worked at this plant so long, you're a plant
Look at your goddamn boots!
For Christ sakes, they’re starting to grow roots!
On this mic you get faded
You look like a pissed-off rapper who never made it
And why you fuckin' with the gay guy, G?
When really you're the one who's got the HIV
Man, I’m done with this clown, he's soft
Fuck it, I’ll let homegirl finish you off

[Vanessa (Miz-Korona)]
A guy like you would never get a real woman
You jackass, go jack off; that's the only way you cumin'



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah. 50 Cent. Lloyd Banks. Tony Yayo. G-Unit

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part in my life
So if you jeopardize it I got the right
To send a mothafucker at you tonight
G-Unit
And I ain't stopping till my clique popping, swimming in barrels of money
Ma could walk around with her head up cause it [?] you, dummy
It's funny, niggas'd rather see you suffering and hungry
I'm comfy as hell skating with another nigga's money
You lying your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pulling your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, a piece of the game, boy
Artillery that's about as long as a chainsaw
By the way, man, this feels like I've been dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feeling my semen
The physical presence of a female in he forms of a demon
That's why I fuck 'em and leave 'em, get my nut while I'm breathin'
Cause they thought they'd catch me slipping, now I'm ducking and driven
That's a thousand dollar outfit, what the fuck is you rippin'?
You tripping, no record could get my ass in position
Death waits for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through mama bitching in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, it's probably sending out to prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the hood
But can't take the hood out me (cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggas hate when you do good
But when you broke
Your friends and your enemies they love you, they love you
"Cheche, get the Yayo"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Cheche, get the Yayo"
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sniff me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fucking country
Wall Street niggas, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothing but trouble
I'll make your money double, cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nikes, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustling backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you moving forwards
You trying to move more birds
N PA all day, on the corner of Third, nigga what?

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You can take me out the hood
But can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishing pistols, I'm coming to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playing? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols, lets get it popping
Start wavin' my emboies, shell cases get to dropping
If death is around the corner I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket, just stunting, no stopping
I'm dying to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless
You know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessings, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak shall perish
I told you before
Hoes, they compliment me now like, "50, nice chain"
Bellagio, twenty grand of chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop, gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga, you see me
I wonder if you mad cause I'm doing good
Or 'cause niggas feeling me more than you in your own hood
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rapping and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, explain it to the niggas in your hood, nigga. They know you fucking fronting, nigga. Talking like gangstas on a record. I see you, nigga. Niggas know me, nigga. Ask around in my hood, nigga. Read the Daily News, nigga. You see them talking about me, nigga. I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit. Pussy, let's get it popping



[Intro: Eminem]
Woo-hoo! *laughs*
Guess who's back?!
Mommy, we're home!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody, put your hands where my eyes can see!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo
Everywhere we go people know we roll deep as fuck
Forty, fifty Samoans, they knowin' when D-Bo was
50, Tweezy, Obie, there won't be no ho in us
They pop shit like they gonna do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We changed the way we move, so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us (Ha)
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much, it's just
That if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
'Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon' be in it
No one's gonna hear nothing, no one's gonna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is 'bout it, 'bout it
The noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
'Til the club closes, and clears out, and that's when they see you flattened
Nobody saw it happen, all 'cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's 'bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playin' no games
We ain't budgin', neither are they, we ain't sayin' no names
Shit just ain't the same when AK's get to sprayin'
"Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"
It ain't about hip-hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about tryna rip shots to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
'Cause "Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Took my strap off my holster, 'cause shit is getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you done
When you stood against the gangster who live and die by the gun
Caught a hot one, sprayin' you bitches 'til there was none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
You silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches for envyin' all our riches
The game's just like a midget, you clockin' a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

[Chorus: Eminem]
Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playin' no games
We ain't budgin', neither are they, we ain't sayin' no names
Shit just ain't the same when AK's get to sprayin'
"Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"
It ain't about hip-hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about tryna rip shots to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
'Cause "Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"

[Verse 3: Ganxsta Ridd]
Uh, Ganxsta, Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On the shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these imitators parading like they some players
Tryna save hip-hop the task is something greater
'Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivators
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a full circle with homies that's s'posed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

[Chorus: Eminem]
Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playin' no games
We ain't budgin', neither are they, we ain't sayin' no names
Shit just ain't the same when AK's get to sprayin'
"Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"
It ain't about hip-hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about tryna rip shots to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
'Cause "Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"



[Verse 1: Eminem]

When the mic is passed to be it's like blasphemy
You know it has to be something dastardly
That I'm about to kick
When I reroute and pick the mic up
And I strike up you like, yup
You better be because I'm killing MCs
Turning them to swiss cheese
When I bust rhymes like



Weed lacer
'97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary
Had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I'm on some Loc shit
Some fed up wit the 'being broke' shit
I'm not to joke with
Bitch, I don't sell crack
I smoke it
Having a coke fit and going through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted
I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets
Empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers because I'm always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking
Talking about, "Who want it"
Thug and a crook
Every drug in the book
I've done it
My 9's at your brain
Is that your chain
Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavour
Aggressive nature's got me sticking you for your progressive pager
Spectacular
Battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mama's Acura
Wrecked it and sold it back to her
Cruise in Nike jackets
Escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
"I might be back quick"
So barricade your entrance
Put up some extra fences
A woman beater
Wanted for repeated sex offences
Chasing dips
Take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping them and trapping them in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Got you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama don't you cry
Your son's too far gone
I'm so high
I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up
I feel just like an overworked plumber
I'm sick of the crap
What's Jack Kevorkian's phone number



[Intro]
Baby, your Dada loves you
And I'm always gonna be here for you
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I'd never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on, hey, hey, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Where's mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin'; it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama; she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife honey, let go of it
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sand castle?
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
Don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eating dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilt ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

[Chorus]
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us

[Verse 2]
See, honey, there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
There's a place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em, except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya?
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to you
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit trying to climb out
I told you it's okay, hey hey, you wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-goo-goo gah-gah
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up, so I can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie & Clyde: me and my daughter
Me and my daughter
Me and my daughter

[Chorus]
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us

[Verse 3]
Wake up sweepy head, we're here
Before we play, we're gonna take Mamafor a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock?
We'll tie it to her footsy, then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now? Here we go, on the count of 3:
1, 2, 3, wee!
There goes Mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step Dada, no more brother
Blow her kisses buh-bye, tell Mommy you love her
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a sand castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Outro]
Just the two of us



[Intro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

[Verse 2]
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes Mama, spashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby



[Intro]
Blastin' off(Aw yeah!)
Yo, I'm sayin' though, you understand what's going on London?

[Pre-Performance Ad-Libs]
One two, one two
One two, one two, one two
Y'all done started something that you can't undo
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm up in the spot with Tim Westwood
You wanna step to this? You better use your best foot
Flawless freestyles I drop right off the top
Take a bottle of beer and bite off the top
Right of the block, straight to your neighbourhood
The flavor's good in London and I'ma stay for good
Yo, check it out, it's Slim Shady
I rip the radio right off of the S baby
Y'all can't see me 'cause y'all don't wanna even be it
Y'all don't understand these freestyles when I MC it
Original bad boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace
I lace the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped on my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was 6 months
And said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feeling these kicks, cunt?
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you're sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet
If y'all don't like me you can suck my dick till you numb it
And all the gibberish you were spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it
And any MC that try to step to this I'll throw you right off of the roof
Ayo, bust it Proof!

[Verse 2: Proof]
One of a kind and I come with the time
Having fun with the rhyme until I'm done with your mind
Listen, now every MC got a story
Well mine is me and my story is an >❓❓< before me
I'm sorry >❓❓< the style to be proved
Ayo since Big Daddy Kane fell off they don't know how to be smooth
Yo, I seen a fat rodent walk in with Paul Rosen
With a gat in holding, talking 'bout he DeShaun Holton
It's the same thing, we bust when it come through
With Tim Westwood, your best foot forward
Can't do that, here it is, put your good foot
We mack y'all, like y'all was some hoes on Wood wood
No time for that, flatbacks when you rap, counterattack
With a battle axe, you collapse from them whack raps
You try to spit to me, I make you all know I'm a genius
A >❓❓<
Come back holding my―yo, no need to cuss, bust (penis!)
Yo we can't say that keep it the cleanest, the meanest
Slim Shady, next thing it was my fault
Y'all caught outlined in chalk, incredible as the Hulk
While I settle for >❓❓<, it's the P-R-letter O
Sex is hetero, cash more checks than federal, you better know
How you feel about they got a dope cheddar flow
And my man Dee Teezy, straight from Stress magazine
Bag a scene, we drag your queen
Like she's a man dressed up, how you feel you get pressed up
Left up, it's time for that P-R-O-O, you get F'd up
Yeah it's time for that mind combat
Next up my man Slim Shade when we rhyme at

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Last night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
And rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
Shucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I've called in to work cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be
Give me 11 Excedrin and my head will spin
Medicine will get me reving like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls till I shred the skin
Doctor check this rash, look how red it's been
It's probably AIDS, forget it then
I'll strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense like dykes using dildos
So reach in your bill folds for 10 duckets
And pick up the Slim Shady stuff that's on Rawkus
Some'n some'n some'n some'n, I can't read it
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, the truth hurt when Proof hurt
Move the whole Earth beneath your feet just like loose dirt
So F your politics if you swallow, feel the hollow tips rip
Through your collar disc, learn your knowledges
Then burn your colleges, I touch your grill
With the skill of a dermatologist, your turn to follow this
Acknowledge this head cracker, ho smacker
Whack rapper attacker, internet hacker
No slacker, best factor, Midwest bracket
Yeah you know about it, it's us on your jacket
DJ Headscratcher like a hatchet, who can match it?
Make you go-go like Gadget, perform magic
Without a wand, I drop bombs without Saddam
A vet' without 'Nam, I make sense without common ground
I'm still down y'all with my first crew
You got a fly style, I down that just like curfew
Yo I'm worth two ears and a mind full of attention
Plus I'm CEO of the whack MC prevention
Listen to the real gift over ill riffs
Cause you on the mic, me and Em aren't tryna hear like Will Smith
Your career's not over with, come here to cope a spit
We heat the sub y'all before the supernova hit
I know the truth, so now I’m baring all
I make R. Kelly confess he stole his first style from Aaron Hall
A whack MC with a gun, I'm not one
And when see Kurt Cobain tell him "bring back my shotgun"
I got one style for all y'all bazooka
Ayo if I was 2Pac I'd come back from Cuba
Rhyme with me when I push on her tooters
Tryna get wild and then we bust like Lugers
Me and my man Slim Shady, we pen great-y
Take our 80 MC's, West you know what, what
What, what, what, what
What

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Yo yo yo
One more time I come back
Slinging the wack, yo
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Senior
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a messed up childhood, that I use as an excuse
And ain't nothing changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Pfft, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Forget it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 6: Proof]
Yeah, best do like it is
Roll your tape recorders, we came to the London borders
Walk in a caster store, put on a master score
Blast your four, then I trash your store
Your woman start to scream so I stab your whore
Jet out your door faster than a Labrador
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Smoking herb and still we spit
On this microphone, they say I'm allowed to say 'shit'
So I'ma say it as much as I can
Cause it don't matter cause I'm the man
With a fricking beer in my hand
I said frick cause I was respect to Tim Westwood
Y'all wanna step to this, yo I come from the best hood
Detroit, the Motown, where it goes down
Kick the flow sound, rappers they know now
But kick a pro now

[Verse 8: Proof]
Back and forth, me and Em don't need to practice
Y'all lack this, we stick you like a cactus
You scream like a actress, the fact is
Y'all can't see us in '99, 2000
3000, 4000 arousing styles

[Verse 9: Eminem]
And 3 plus, y'all wanna be us
But none of y'all can see us
Even if y'all had some new bifocals, I try locals
So y'all die >❓❓< cause I smoke you
Plus I provoke you and then I bust
Freestyles y'all can't trust, I'm like Canibus
I bust, can I bust? No you can't
Well yes I can cause I'm Slim Shady and I'm the man

[Verse 10: Proof]
We flex styles like a bicep
I found out where Canibus money went
I borrowed a dollar from Wyclef
Rhyme deaf MC's need to try this
You can't get with this, make you one of my
Plus that, we bust back, yo F that
Rap that, step up and get flat
And it's time for y'all to hear what this year's around
Detroit been quiet long enough
Yo Slim, I need you to back me up
My freestyles ain't connecting
They better start respecting

[Verse 11: Eminem]
Well I'ma check then with dirty needles
It's two of us but we're not the Beatles
Cause there was three of them, and I am seeing them
But yall ain't seeing Em even if I was driving in the BM in the PM
With the top up and the top down, don't matter cause I rock now
Yo y'all can hear the Glock sound, 2Pac now
Yo that's what I am when I bust, this lyrical image
Y'all can't just betray the scrimmage
That I be killing when I be busting and I'm crushing
Any MC leave em with no freaking discussion

[Verse 12: Proof]
Run up in your house then I shot your wife
Ayo Em, hold these Tylenol 3's while I rock the mic

[Verse 13: Eminem]
Weed lacer, ninty-seven burgundy blazer
Wanted for burgulary, had to ditch the mercury Tracer
I'm on some loc shit, some fed up with this being broke shit
I'm not to joke with, yo I don't sell crack, I smoke it

[Break]
Aight?
Blastin' off, aight?
We blastin' off right now, London!
Tim Westwood baby, you don't understand right now!
We bombing the whole land on some Vietnam shit yo!
Where we >❓❓< yo!

[Verse 14: Eminem]
Hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white person
Trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill, human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back-striking a Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
Everybody's pissing me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
No duh I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?
You can hate me now

[Verse 15: Proof]
Need to run for cover
Eminem is white but he still my brother
Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack
But you and Charli Baltimore got something in common, you both whack
How you feel about that? No need to jock 'em
You so whack you make Master P sound like Rakim
When it's time to bust y'all, when we trust y'all, we dust y'all
Who y'all? Break your balls like cue balls
I know who you are, you RuPaul
Do stall, for those try to fall and try to brawl
All y'all get bust up and banged up, framed up
How many MC's bring my name up?
The same slut said the same thing, it's freestyle
No need to rehearse, my verse is universal
Curse a flow, crush you like Hershel Walker
Allie Sparker, three day sparker highland Parker chalker
You MCs can't get darker than the Midwest bracket
It's us, me and Emzee
Come right there, we feeling flimsy
Tipsed up, one time lifetime we ripped up
It's bad to the evil, met that, now it's all to say
Death rap, fuck hoes, don't even say get blast away, passed away
Blasted ass, hey yo, they say we're Aftermath
Slim Shady, you heard that, my words black
But bust you up because you preferred that
To hear me now, preferred that, the surgical snipe
Preserved you with life, I'll make you allergic to life
You die for this, don't even battle us
See us at the―what's that?―Subterreanean
We knock your brain in

[Outro]
Flows are hmm delly-lah like Arabian!
(Proof mimicking Arabian speech)
Ayo, ayo
We don't wanna hear that best white rapper, we be talking 'bout
Best rapper
Get all that out, you know what I'm sayin' ?
No doubt, never
Blastin' off
Explosions left and right(left and right)
This is legendary(Legendary)
Legendary!(Remember this show!)
This is John Lennon, this is John Lennon, legendary
Remember this show
History, baby
We on some John Lennon
Blowin', blowin'
We blowin' the spot right now London
Where it's war yo!
Blowin'!
It doesn't even matter
Slim Shady, Big Proof
Cmon Tim Westwood
We blowin' up the spot right now London!
London's done, it's gone!
What did ya think baby?
Thanks for having us Tim
No doubt, no doubt, we blowin' up the spot
We blastin' off with Tim Westwood now
You understand what's going on London?
No doubt!
Big up New York, big up Paris, big up London
Big up Jersey, big up Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan
Big up Tim Westwood
We makin' it happen yo!
Tim Westwood, where it's born!
Thank you everybody, have a good night's sleep



[Intro: Claret Jai]
The poor stays poor, the rich get richer
It’s just so disproportionate

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Terrible, but not rip-able, invincible, I hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe all over the world, I stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it, hoes
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches this is no
Joke, goin' overboard like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Cough from all the smoke, I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers
I don't love the hose
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face
Back in that bitch, smother that little
Motherfucker 'til it suffocates (Who?)
You had long enough of a wait, why are they
Tryin' to be so secretive? Bad and Evil is reunited, hey!
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straights as I await
Word on Satan as I drop, fall to my knees before this
Ouija board and I pray, now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I’m sleepin' now, imagine if I awake?
I'm champ, bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy
Never mushy, so you can't squish
Nowhere near a tush, in fact if I jump out a bush
In a sneak attack's, the only way I'll say I am-Bush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that I brandish
Stand-offish to hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law? Fuck protocol, I'd holla at this ho
But now my throat is sore

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it (Royce!)

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Baby, I'm lawless
You couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
I'm at ya, homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you
While you nappin', homie, have everything on and around
Your mattress lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony
You high, thug? Yeah, go 'head, jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUIs get waived like sayin' bye
Still ridin' with no L's like James Todd, can't change, I
I thank God for my safe thinkin', last time I was safe thinkin'
Me and my niggas was doin' a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye
I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit, I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers want to set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em, left or right? Head or gut?
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you FUBAR
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite, I could just
Throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you're not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your Metro
In a bad area that call dropped

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it



[Intro]
A day without a rhyme
W-Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to

[Verse 1]
Stepped into my world, let the lyrics lead the way
It's a place of escape that deviates from the everyday
UGH
A resort of a sort, it's for your mind, though
So you relax them acts, and me, I let the rhyme flow
So you can follow it, chew it before you swallow it
The lyric is a delicate thing, you shouldn't holler it
And yell it, this is (?), give your lyrics your all
But remember one thing, a weak rhyme could be your downfall
Take it from me 'cause I'm a hip hop authority
Poetry redemption is our number one priority
A day without a rhyme is like a day without sunshine
How can you unwind without a funky drum line?
I can't see it, let the Ken Wood kick
Why? 'Cause rhyming is my game, and the mic is like a joystick
I never lose, my lyrics sting like a hornet
I get ready for help, this for the town before the storm hits

[Verse 2]
Perform is eternal, and in my lifetime
I hope I never have to see a day without a rhyme
Legendary, the lyrical Olympian
Merciless and cruel, I rule 'cause I'm the champion
Defending my position like a heavyweight fighter
A dope rap writer, deadly as a poisonous spider
Yeah, no comparison, the women seem mysterious
My lyrics work as servants, leaving listeners delirious
Under my hypnosis on the edge of their seat
It's like a science fiction movie, with groovy hip hop beats
So just relax and you'll enjoy the double feature
Let my vocals take control of your soul, then let the rolling reach you
You can't ignore the dance floor anymore
The rhymes are mind blowing for the fancy and the hardcore
Hip hop lovers who pump it as a past-time
The furthest sent from their mind, a day without a rhyme

[Bridge]
A day without a rhyme
Without a strong rhyme to step to
A day without a rhyme
Without a strong rhyme to step to

[Verse 3]
Floating the top, a growing sea of MC's
Liquidating sucker rappers like a fatal disease
That's right, I flick lives, like boogers from my fingers
My assassin has my back, smoking dope just like a gunslinger
I'm just a merciless dog, you know the time (huh)
I'd rather die than go a day without a rhyme
You see, a lyric is a poet's personal emotion
A pocket full of holes, he throws a deep devotion
(?), keeps the roof (?) running
My rap game is (?), makes the floor drizzle (?)
It's as dumb as it can be, there's not an MC who can hang with me
They like to battle but they never wanna bang with me
'Cause I'm a real (?) and dog (?), AG at it
In fact I'm just a dope rhyme fanatic
I like to rock the party every time I get a chance to
But on a day without a rhyme what would you dance to?
(?) but no, it's nothing like this
The drums are death, and my DJ has a crisp twist
Larger than life, dear mayor of the new school
Flushing rappers out like a motherfucking whirlpool
Bloodthirsty, a witch and a boy, yeah
The MC destroy your boy, what can I do for you?
You don't want me, you'll never survive
You'll be eaten alive the very second you are mine
So do yourself a favour, save your breath
And take a step to me and you'll step into the arms of death
And quite frankly, that will be a real slither
I rarely use the (?), is it time to feel the flipper, boy?
This '89, my rhymes are clicking like clockwork
I need a Grammy, so I'm a piece of chalk work
(?) entertaining you, I kick fiction
But don't be alarmed if you hear a contradiction, that
Who's to say what the future might bring?
By the grace of Allah, I'll just continue doing my thing
Creeping the math, and then that constant movement
But do say lyrics that can stand no improvement, so
Yo, if you were sleeping, or napping, or waking
You know who you are, I guess you're just breathtaking
I write the rhyme to strike you like a lightning bolt
With every finishing stroke, another rap is smoke
So I'm the 'Deej' this year, the microphone musketeer
This is the year of the merciless Ameer (Word!)
(?), there's no lying in my dialogue
'Cause when I go out, I'm going like a raw dog
Well this was fun, I hate to break but I gotta run
My homie's landing on my box with the 911
See you next time, but in the meantime
Try not to go even a single day without a rhyme

[Outro]
W-Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
W-Without a strong rhyme to step to
A day without a rhyme
Yeah, dog, that was dope

[Intro]
La la la la la la
La la la la, la
La la la la la la, la
Hahahahaha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Oops, I did it again, didn't I?
My shit's harder to figure out than what Britney's tit size is
Ooh, I probably pissed you off again, didn't I, bitch?
So what? Christina Gaguilera better kiss my grits
You know how many shits I give? I wish I did
So I can quit giving these twisted little kids ideas
This just in: Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit-fucked and dick-sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked, how come I can't?
Shit, god damn, bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this
Are those pictures I made of us together on the internet
As close as I'm ever gonna get to hitting it from the back?
And shit, when it comes to that, I hit harder from the back
Than Everlast when he's plugging Lethal in his fucking ass
Just give me one more chance, Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelry, my record's almost diamond, BEEOTCH!

[Chorus: Eminem]
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Diff'rent Strokes?
Gary's broke, Todd's snorting coke, and Dana overdosed (aw!)
I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me (Hee! Hee!)
I'm up early with my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furley, fucking Laverne and Shirley

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
A lot of rappers are living in la-la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a Jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps asking me why I rap with a honkey
But granny I'm a flunky, I could be a junkie
I could be hanging with the hoochies out at the club scene

[Bridge: Kon Artis]
To all the independent women in the house! (Hooouse!)
Show us your tits and shut your motherfucking mouth! (What?!)

[Verse 4: Proof]
Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston
The shit she's using
Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal
Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbell's
Pee Wee Herman's, peep show places
Public restrooms, peep those cases!

[Chorus: Eminem]
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)

[Verse 5: Swift]
Your mom and dad probably mad at us (for what?)
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Ain't like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns?
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you ain't getting paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I ain't in y'all life, so stay they hell up outta mine! (Nigga)
Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dying
If you people get offended I don't care (stop crying!)
Trying to get us to leave cause what we say just ain't clean (uh, uh)
But holding back on what I say just ain't me

[Verse 6: Kon Artis]
Now what's these parents all mad for?
"Your music is bad for 'em"
For teenage kids that drink more than Ted Danson in Cheers
Carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch (SHUT UP!)
Broke or rich, I still do that same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask them this

[Chorus: Eminem]
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh
[Kuniva]
Look out for the D12 R&B album coming out soon
Straight R&B, straight R&B, straight R&B
Jodeci, we got you!



[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Post-Chrous: B.o.B]
Dreaming… of falling
Dreaming… of falling

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Tryin' to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-Town)
Hopin' for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Sellin' out arenas with big-ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened (never)
Like I never had dreams of bein' a rapper (rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes (classes)
Like I never used to run away into the blackness (yeah)
Now, let's pretend like it was all good (good)
Like I didn't live starin' in the notebook (notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood)
Yeah, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name (no)
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin' back before the mixtapes (Cloud 9)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame (yeah)
Before they ever once compared me to André (3 stacks)
Before I ever got on MySpace (yeah)
Before they ever noticed my face (yeah)
So let's just pretend and make wishes outta airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Bridge: B.o.B. & Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
They're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
All right…

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
"Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win."
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!
"You won't amount to shit—quit daydreamin', kid!
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that—

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now



[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah yo, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A (A-Town)
Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people want to hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now, let's pretend like it was all good
Like I didn't live staring in the notebook
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood
Yo, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or A.K.A. Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre (3000)
Before I ever got on MySpace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend, and make wishes out of airplanes

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Bridge: B.o.B. & Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream

[Cr7z]
Nehmen wir an, ich hätte mich für Hip-Hop niemals entschieden:
Hätte niemals auch nur eines meiner Lieder geschrieben
Was wäre dann?
Würde ich studieren statt meine Zeit in Musik investieren
Peanuts verdienen, und Doppelschichten an Fließbändern schieben?
Programmier ich Videospiele oder würd ich Ken-Jitsu praktizieren bis zum zehnten Dan?
Ich nehme an, ich wäre alles in allem wohl besser dran
Doch nichts davon läge mir in der Wiege
Ich bin gespannt auf die Zukunft
Auf jeden Beat den ich kriege
Bastel ich wieder ein Brett
Für diese Rapper-Szene und vielleicht zieh ich weg
Weg von dem Beef mit den Hiesigen MC's
Die ich schon überbiete seitdem ich 16 bin
Cr7z wird entdeckt -
Und released über BMG, an jedem Track verdien ich
Rappe auf riesigen Jams, werde zur Raplegende
Und wenns mein Ziel ist, dann:
BANG! - Besiegel das Feature mit B.o.B. Hayley & Eminem
Das wär perfekt:
Ich könn' meiner Familie was bieten
Sähe nicht mehr diesen Verlierer im Spiegel
Ich weiß: Ich bin nicht Realistisch genug
Aber mir geht es so gut
Wenn ich davon träume wie's wäre -
Und gehe friedlich mit nem' Lächeln zu Bett
Meine Fantasie lässt mich fliegen
An die Plätze für die mein Herz schlägt
Ich werde sehen, wie's in den Sternen steht
Bis dahin spazier ich neben der Landebahn
Heb die Hand an die Stirn wenn ich wieder einen sehe und denk mir:

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars....
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now



[Intro]
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper to shot a fan
Gucci's my absolute state of mind like Waka's man
Chopper's spraying, getting head in a car parked, new Gallardo
This bitch sucking my dick today, call it yesterday's news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Tae Bo, 'bout to cross over, I'm the new Ivo
'Bout to saves a couple of these bitches
That's right, I'm the new Bible
You? You five-o. Me? I'm more grounded than punishments
But I'm too fly though
Y'all niggas be whining, I should call you Moscato

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Look down at the floorboard
It looks like someone left a pair of stiletto shoes in my Tahoe
Never know just what type of a ho inside of my ride I may let
Last night went to 5 a.m. and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck
I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes
And I ain't get out the fucking driveway yet
Soon as I open the door you try to resist
What for? Get in girl, don't front, shorty
You're fighting an un-winnable war, it's useless
As tits on a boar or little tits on a whore
Got 'em acting like spoiled brats kicking and screaming
Like little kids throwing fits on the floor
Get in the whip, but you ain't turning this frog into a prince
Why you tryna keep convincing me for?

[Chorus: Female Vocalist and Eminem]
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
You won't get one
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Not from me
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Not on the lips, are you crazy?
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now you in my whip just as long as you understand that I can't be whipped
You say companionship, I say abandon ship
I'm a gigolo so you know
I'm always on the go
I don't got no time to slow down for no relationshit
Drop the P and add a T
Yeah, you can get mad at me all you want
But I'm ghost before you can even say boo hun, let alone call me one
A one night stand is all he wants with a female fan, yeah, one like Stan
And he's so 'bout a one nightstand
His bedroom has two lamps and only one nightstand
Get the hint?
Ooh yeah boo – ew
I ain't finna argue, but why do you think they call it boo?
Yeah, 'cause the sound of it s'posed to scare you

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9”]
Oh ho, we can share you in the back of the McLaren
I don't give a fuck what your name is
We gon' call you "Hi" and "Bye"
Hope you bi in the meantime your name is Sharon
Slow the flow down so I can what?
Tell you same face I make
When I'm shooting the gun's the same face that I make when I fuck
From the back of my hand on your neck
Pressing your face against these sheets, it's insane
You vin changed
'Cause I'm outta this world girl
I got that Milky Way dick vein
I'm at an all-time high with highness
I'm at an all-time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness, yeah

[Chorus: Female Vocalist and Eminem]
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
You won't get one
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Not from me
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Not on the lips, are you crazy?
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

[Verse 5: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper to shot a fan
Push a chick out the car while it's moving like Waka's man
Her bottom's dark, but her top is tan, her private parts
Got her on the pole, like the opposite of her papa's plans
Come on stripper, let's hit the strip, 180, throw it in reverse
And drop the trans, I'm in the trance, now look at this bitch dance
Looking at this tramp like, "What are you wearing girl? Quit playing"
Yeah, bitch and them scratch and sniff pants
Well let me scratch 'em
Let me sniff, yeah
What? Did I say that? I'm on lean like Styrofoam cups and kickstands

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Middle finger stuck on fuck
Stiff hands, but girl you got a butt like no if ands
So yeah, what the hell, maybe
All hail, Shady, he'll tell it like it is
So tell Katy Perry he's on her tail, he's tailgating
These bells are my mating call and I'm here
Bell's waiting, and tell Lady
Gaga, she can quit her job at the post office, she's still a male lady
Wouldn't fuck her with her dick, you heard it, the verdict's in
He's allergic to divas and take meat cleavers to 'em
Him don't give a damn about beaver do him
What a demon, a behemoth evil just seems to be seething through him

[Verse 7: Royce da 5’9”]
I like the little strip tease you doing this evening
You and me gon' find three more chickadees and have a menage like Nicki
You hot like a Dickie outfit in Texas without shit under it
Sweating, suck my dick or get to stepping's my logic

[Verse 8: Eminem]
My God trick, my dick is hard, as stiff as a yardstick
What are we gonna do?
Ride around 'til we're carsick?
I'ma put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark
In the parking lot of the trailer park by the garbage
What're you waiting on, me to roll out the carpet?
Condoms are in the glove compartment, let's start it
Think I'm joking?
What, am I sitting here tryna make fake farts with my armpits?
Tryna get you to spit pop through your nose?
Am I here to amuse you? Stop it

[Verse 9: Royce da 5’9”]
I'm in your pocket outside of a church
The other hand reaching for the bottom of your purse
You giving me head in a boxing stance
My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt
I'm not your man, we're sparring partners
There's five things you are in charge of
That's: sucking the dick, sucking the dick
Sucking the dick, sucking the dick, sucking the dick

[Verse 10: Eminem & Royce da 5’9”]
And if you ain't sucking a dick, why you sitting there
With puckered lips? Oh that's collagen, muhfuckin' bitch
What you mean how'd you get suckered into this?
You gon' jump into my truck and then try to get truculent
You should be suffering, you should be cooking
You should be buckling your seat belt with oven mitts
Excuse me while I'm making an ass out of myself
But it's only because I just wanna get

[Chorus: Female Vocalist and Eminem]
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
You won't get one
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Not from me
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Not on the lips, are you crazy?
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

[Outro: Royce da 5’9”]
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper to shot a fan



[Hook: Eminem]
From the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up
All day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)
So I go straight at opponents' heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
The chopper got about fifty bullets
Ain't no way it's accidental when I spill 'em on you
I'm the realest in the biz, how you livin'?
'Cause you can get it how you live
And while you livin', I'mma say my pull out game is so real
I still get rid of kids, now that's ill
The top of your head can fly of the top of convertibles
Ain't gon' really take no time to come through and murder you
I don't fake mine, I do this the fair way
Snitches get stitches, blown away and left on display
Hung by the grapevine, I just kicked a chair away
Let me be the first to tell you that you lookin' at a superstar
My microphone and AK-47, that's my new guitar
I don't belong to you and I don't care who you are
Yeah, you sold a couple records, got a couple joints
Got a few Jordans, three, four pairs of Louboutins
That's besides the point like a shootin' guard
Nigga, I'm a rockstar

[Verse 2: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9'']
With whoopin' cough
I am sick, George Clooney wit' a Uzi
What kind of a movie star
Would hop out a movin' car just to prove he’s hard?
"Fuck you doin', you retard?"
Should be put in a cast as soon as we start shootin', dog
You swear I knew where the Roofies are
The way I drug a bitch... through the yard
Stuffed little Suzie in cardboard after wrappin' her nude and newly scarred
Body in waterproof tarp covered in roofin' tar
So what you so blunt for?
Did you fuckin' fall off, chump? Or did you jump?
Or did you just become bored with this?
You’re slipping into a funk, I just become morbid
And more self-absorbed in my own world, everyone orbits
Pen at the table, I don’t know when I’ll be able to stop
Told you from the gate
One thought it generally takes and I’m off to the races
Wait, mentally stable, hold your fuckin' horses
There’s nothin' more disgustin' an animal
I just got done snortin' the fuckin' bathroom soap
And the tannin' lotion
To unwarp this mind you gon' need some sort of an antidote
There’s not a pill for bananas though
It’s unfortunate, you got delusions of grandeur though
Actin' like you’re Michelangelo with a fuckin' cordless
Bitch, I'm Shredder, so you better crawl back in your shell
Or run 'fore you get injured
A fuckin' Ninja Turtle wouldn’t come toward us
Two joint forces, of course this is what blunt force is
'Cause we’d smoke you on any joint
Bad and Evil's back, bitch
You might experience some shortness of breath
As you sit with your lungs punctured
Hear their motherfuckin' tears come pourin'
If I tell you once more, then you’re done for
You’re going to have to learn
How to fuckin' hear from a ruptured eardrum
Forrest, am I clear? You Gump, you’re as dumb as a stump
To think we'd come with a trunk shortage
B-b-b-b-bass in your face, bitch
Chuck Norris’ nunchucks morph into guns, swords
This is what blood sport is
The goriest, glorious, notorious bigamous, shogun warriors
God damn, the Slaughter boy general
Once I slaughter it, you couldn’t un-slaughter it
Once I order a hit, you couldn’t un-order it
Hit's an order, this the consortium

[Hook: Eminem]
From the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up
All day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)
So I go straight at opponent's heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
If I don’t got no more drama, bitch, I’m a fish outta water bottle
After all these guys I slaughter
Applause is gettin' louder, how the fuck did this happen?
I never rapped for bitches, how's it that my audience now is broader?
Devil without a cause, rebel without a pause
I am a kaze without the kami
You wouldn’t be a G if you cost me a thousand dollars
Infrared in my pencil lead
But always keep an extra one stocked though
In the back pocket and both of 'em locked
And they're loaded, like cocked twin Glocks that I’m holdin'
You better pause when you see these two dots on your colon
Fuckin' punks, you wait, just got to rockin' and rollin'
'Cause Elvis ain’t left the buildin' yet, I’m still a villain
You feel a threat when I step in and kill a set in a millisec
With the weapon of intellect, Hannibal Lecter with the black belt
In kung fu, protect your neck and

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9”]
Respect the gun rule
Read in the Art of War book by Sun Tzu
You realize if you defy, you probably won't be around here long
Rapunzel (get over it)
Look, bitch, I got the bands in my pocket
And the drum roll poppin', that's...
That’s overkill, I keep the kill under me
I keep the chill one degree
I hit you with a hook that’ll make you see threes
You realize as soon as you beat me that you didn’t
Yeah, there’s still one of me, now me slap you
That’s a recap view, that’s normal embarrassing
And you slap me, that’s knee-slap humor, that’s hardly hilarious
So we scrap over you lyin' like a feline cub in a forest
Cherishing a kill from a dominant male

[Verse 5: Eminem]
And I’m born with Malaria
Form of Lou Gehrigs
To torture and terrify corporate America
Poor little Erica
In the morning the sheriff's and Law Enforcement
Will find one fourth of her buried
Under a barrier of the kitchen floor
With the stairs in an outdoor wooded area

[Hook: Eminem]
From the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up
All day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)
So I go straight at opponent's heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 6: Royce da 5’9”]
Back then hoes didn't want him
Now the black Benz all hittin' corners
My spectacular vernacular
I spit like giving Ex-Lax to Dracula
Let me translate: I’m tryna find me a bitch
And then I’m sucking on her neck while she naked
And then I’m shitting on her

[Verse 7: Eminem]
And I’m getting boners from what I’m spitting
Getting blown to smithereens in a Toyota
Getting stoned ta Jonas Brothers
Brothers, songs fricken rotisserie how these birds are flipping
A time bomb with a nervous tick
Another murder victim, I flirted with them first
And burrr-stick ‘em, I'd burn up if I try to step foot inside a church chicken
[scratching noise] wanna [scratching noise] making sure any who battle me crawl away
Assault and battery holiday, and just when you’re thinking that’ll be all I say
I’ll start automatically calling names and rattling off fellow rappers so pardon the analogy
But I disappear as quick as Natalee Holloway
It’s my mentality all the way, I’m normally a suicide mission to try dissin'
But one thing I never mind's getting called Elvis all the time
In the articles that you write which is why I never reply, 'cause he died shitting
So-a, shitting, I'm spitting my infinite supply of written bonafide
Kidding aside, critics take my little white dick in your eyelid like to fuck it
Switch subjects, moving on to the next one it's Ch- Chucky
Who wanna play with number one overall, Kid Cudi
A psycho buddy who might go nutty ‘cause he don’t like nobody
His knife's so bloody ‘cause he just sliced somebody
Pull out the Schick Hydro and

[Verse 8: Royce da 5’9”]
In light of what he, just said, this for those who even kinda want it
'Cause for this man, I would take a lighter
And light up all of my Lighter money
You can call it pyro money, "Hi Rihanna"
I mean wait, "Hi Tianna", wait, "Hi Tatiana", shit
I gotta problem I don’t like, it's called fuck a model-itis
Who pussy the tightest?
That’s amazing, sit your ass down
I don’t like the pussy too tight
Get the fuck outta here and have some babies
Vocabulary still ill, the 911 still will
It’s all yellow with the black stripe, kill bill
I’m so far ahead of the skills here
Getting ready for my past life
I’m the real deal

[Verse 9: Eminem]
Like Holyfield, think you irreplaceable? Bite it  (that’s overkill)
'Til I keel over like somebody stuffed roadkill and
Ebola in my bowl of oatmeal, you know the deal
I’m not about to sit and go through the whole spiel
Of how I’m- how I’m cold steel like an old closed snowmobile
And no feeling but so jovial
But don’t be one of those who mistake me for a joke, I'm so for real
It’s what I told the phony emcee before I broke his will
Drove a drill through his skull to see his soul
Told him when I snap like a photo
He’ll get exposed like a roll of film
Now here he goes again, oh
I’m so trill, I’mma get the hoes again
Like Buffalo Bill's, bitch you didn’t put lotion in
The bucket, fuck it, beat the poor little old widow
With throw pillows, soap brillos, finished my goat milk then
Smoke billows I lit up...ah, fuck it



[Intro: Obie Trice] + Nate Dogg
Trell
Say niggas in Detroit don't make beats
Straight out the hood nigga
My nigga Trell, Obie Trice, Shady Records

[Nate Dogg]
From hard times (All of my life)
Got this lady on my mind
To good times (All of my days)
Wanna hit it all the time
She's mine (struggled with strife)
I was down and locked away
She's mine (thought about it everyday)
From hard times

[1st Verse]
You know a nigga wanna touch your body
We can keep in touch have an after party
Know you wanna fuck cause your acting naughty
You see us in the matress probably, ha
Wanna be involved cause the entourage I'm endulged in
You say you love my dirty drawers you're all in
Wanna sleep with the star, be baby mom
Eat lobster, see where you're coming from
Cause hey that nigga got dick for days
There ain't too many niggas blessing O's ways
I guess I just get better with old age
Cause in my hey, puss made me say "May day"
Anyway, today I'm a different human being
I crush 'em, make 'em scream
It's nothing, ain't a thing
Fronting like the dick ain't off the chain
Slicing niggas tires and things

[Hook: Nate Dogg]]
(From hard times, All of my life)
At the after party, we can get naughty watchin your body
(To good times, All of my days)
Get the shit started, coke and bacardi
Get juice and gin, and up off that ready to roll
(It's my time)
At the after party, it's a private party
What happens at the party stays at the party
(Moonshine)
Girl go and party, back up that body
Into my body, girl let's go
(From hard times)

[2nd Verse]
You know I'm somewhere where I can ease my mind be
On some island, dime piece beside me
No paparazzi, eyeing at hiney
But I am right behind she
Wanna bump and grind, crying saying I'm all up in her side
Bringin down her menustration cycle
Girl I lay pipe the the right, pipe to the left
Pipe all night, a pipe dream right
O Trice advice your type
If it ain't him it's a nigga in my clique you like
If the misses insists on the dick tonite
We throw assists like Scott Pip and Mike
You blow a kiss on my tip you just might
Get a whiff off the kid up in your windpipe
Now see that insight, it excites
Cause she's undressing for that sex right?

[Hook]

[3rd Verse]
Take time out my hectic schedule
Just to give you the pleasure your request fo'
When I hit your spine that's how you measure O
Tell your girlfriends you ain't had it like this before
Now your girlfriends all up in the mits of O
Wanna be mistress, all cause a few extra inches
Blew back your entrance, you lack experience
New jack, my crew ran through that for instance
We can fuck from dusk til dawn
It's no discussion who's nuts your on
She's such in a rush to cum
Wanna choke on a dong, like it's a bong
And what is he doin, he making her moan
Make her wanna leave that mothafucka she got back home
All O knowing is to keep hoes going
Enjoying O Trice's groin

[Hook]
(All of my life)
Got this lady on my mind
(To good times, all of my days)
Wanna hit it all the time
(It's my time, struggle and strife)
I was down and locked away
(Moonshine)
Thought about it everday
(From hard times)



[Intro]
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost taste it

[Spoken: Eminem]
Yeah, can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get to be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come, screaming "Attack!" like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's, laughed at Infinite
Now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, "Ahh!"
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
He's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm the devil, if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gu-uh-uh)-sting
I'm (what) a human mutt fuck a being
I'm a dog, fuck lambs, I'm silencing 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walking, talking Ouija board
Speaking in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norrf
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'Til you scared to stare into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit yo
"Is this some kind of sick joke?" Shit no, motherfucking schizo
So disturbed, he just goes so berserk, he tiptoes
Fist first with scissors to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't fizzuck with
So-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp
So lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn, here comes another Clockwork Orange
Look at Bizarre, you really think he's right in his mind?
What the fuck you think's goin' through it when he's writin' his rhyme?

[Hook: Eminem]
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain in his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain in his violent screams

[Verse 2: Peter S. Bizarre]
It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Picking up transvestites on my Harley-Davidson (hey hop on)
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store (nigga, I'm takin these)
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me)
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry) I had to eat it (ohh)
My dick is burning, it ain't cause of disease
Because I'm jacking off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (AHH!)
I'm living in Waco, Texas, me and my girl
Fuck David Koresh, I'm starting my own world
It's called Bizarre Cemetery, it's scary
Eating a virgin's cherry; they're all gonna laugh at you, Carrie!

[Hook: Eminem]
Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain in his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain in his violent screams

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was born feet first, smoke 40's and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's
Got more power than 5 of Ivan Drago's pythons so
"Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer"
Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro-gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's "Thriller"
Rifle slash knife faggot that's your "Cop Killer"
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was living (aight)
Cross-dressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek, I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at

[Hook: Eminem]
Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain in his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain in his silent screams



[Intro: B-Real]
Yeah, homie
I thought we told we been fucking loco
Cypress Hill, D12, bitch!

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain 'cause I'm a psycho

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm a motherfucking omen, I bow down to no man
Split a nigga open, killing folks compulsive
A soldier with a motive, scrotum big as boulders
I hold 'em then unload on you, put it on a poster
So everyone can notice who was focused on us poking
They nose in our business, hoping that I don't come smoke 'em
No one knows my notions or emotions, I'm a vulture
You niggas close to croaking any moment and I know when
I could fuck the culture up, probably rap
A maniac with anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat
Speak when you spoken to
And I don't have to read a fucking magazine or quotable
To notice what you hoes will do

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up
And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair
And I'm prepared to blast you just as fast as Dre can say "Hell yeah!"
So watch what you say 'cause it can happen either today or the next minute
I can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead serious
You could be dead period, end of story
I'm on your porch with a gun and your son, sipping a forty
Nobody can hold me, I does it all by my lonely
I stomp your head when you awake, you be looking like Gumby
Aftermath and Shady, bitch, you can read it and weep
You see my poster in the 'hood for "the G of the Week"

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain 'cause I'm a psycho

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
They found Saddam, but they ain't gon' find me
I'll be under a tree in Buttfuck, Tennessee
And I don't know too much about my daddy
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny
I ain't a racist, I just hate whites
Fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites
Thirteen years old and joined a fucking gang
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
Am I insane? Who really knows?
'Cause any second my temper can fucking blow
I get colder than December
Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I probably got a screw loose or two
Or maybe three or four of 'em
Some fell out and hit the floor
All I know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
I been a little neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
It's been two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fucking lips with it

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain 'cause I'm a psycho

[Outro: Kuniva]
Karnail Pitts a.k.a. Bugz
Rest in peace, homie



[Verse 1]
Man, you got it all worked out
Don't you? Old pair of shoes
Never wear your heart on your sleeve
Cause it don't go with the suit
You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face
They told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 2]
Mama said steer clear of the devil
So you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side
So you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill
Big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends
Man, imagine how that feels

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 3]
I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we’ll pee in it, fuck you

[Verse 4]
You got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican

[Chorus]
Oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too



[Intro: Eminem]
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm...
(Kill, kill, kill)

[Hook: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

[Hook: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

[Hook: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still
That's why the first mothafucker popping some shit, he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville)
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled (hahahaha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they want to challenge me here?
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibers here?
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year?
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen, when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it Goddammit he meant it when he told you

[Hook: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Outro: Eminem]
Dum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da

(Intro: Linkin Park)
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey
It goes one, two, three

(Verse 1: Linkin Park)
I was born with the hunger of a lion
The strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no I make the track run
My Momma taught me words, my Daddy built rockets
I hold them both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty smart weapon I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it, because you clearly can't stop it like that

(Verse 2: Linkin Park)
It ain't over because the shark's on the left side the snake's on the right
And everything you do, they want to get a little bite
But it really doesn't matter if your wrong or if your right
Because once they get there teeth in nothing really fights
And as for me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like your trying to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier I ain't standing next to you
I'll be laying on the ground before you're even in my view, Like that

(Chorus: linkin Park)
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
When the last bells ring, the poor man sings
Bring me to Kingdom come

(Verse 3: Eminem)
I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breath
Last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down bitch, get fucked with the volume knob
Fuck all you snobs
Hoes I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms, is that all you brought
And you wanna menage a trois you twats
Fuck that i'd rather turn this club into a bar room brawl
Get as rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech in a vacuum y'all, ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap
Yeah, but i'm home
Bad to the bone
Back in the zone
Let him alone
You don't want to go egging him on
It'll never be my chair that you're on
Crown so tight it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen
Other words there's no heir to the thrown
When I die, so does Hip-Hop
Hitchcock, better shit bitch ass got a zip locked in a bag
You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone like I'm in the twilight
Talking of my bone this is my mic dog I like hogging it
Flow so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganing
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplex it on cement like I'm on some straight out of Compton shit
Take this dick and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment
Jack ass eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it, like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit!
I reign supreme in this honkey shit
No sense screaming, and arguing
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in

(Chorus: Linkin Park)
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
When the last bells ring, the poor man sings
Bring me to Kingdom come

[Eminem]
I'm mentally retarded - Slim Shady
I think that's my name - hi, bye

Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced the weed with insect repellant
Better check the smellin'
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel
When she was six months, and said: "I'm ready now, bitch!
Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?!"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
‘Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello, hi!
All of use - hi, bye

Fuckin' crazy

[Capone-N-Noreaga]
Word up ,yo, yo, yo
A little bit of thugs is all it takes to make this industry just great
A little bit of thugs is all it takes to make this industry great
Reflection, reflection

Yo I started out in Iraq the wrong route
More bitches to doubt more money to count
Yo my Swiss account with more cheese amount
Keep piling, still gettin' calls from the island
Still do the things I did when I was wildin'
Tryin' to go from penny loafers to mink sofas
Spend a week with dime bitches that's freaks
Bodies so big I call it [?] antiques
Ass cheeks scream loud like [?]
Wanna be under the seats in our streets
Last year around the time this year
If I would of got locked, yo
I wouldn't even care
But now I got this rap thing
No more hustlin' at age ten my team played to win
We Sonny Carson nobody understanding
Yo the black struggle gotta hustle to hustle
And once you get muscle nobody trust you
Tryin' to be like Goldy in the Shaft days
These lasts days comin' up
Yo these little niggas comin' up
Keep their guns up ready to buck
Not thinkin'
Black on black crime yo it's swine you're both stinkin'
Pretty Ake, [?] to Mobb Deep
Yo its Papi, officially arab nazi
2-5-2 regulate this too

[Verse 2]
I'm ice-grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello, hi!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Verse 3]
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, ‘cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls 'til I shred the skin
"Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!"
"It's probably AIDS!" "Forget it then."
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
"Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded."
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello?!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Outro]
Hi, something's not right
I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded
Slim Shady, I think that's my name
Rawkus Records, fuckin' crazy
Do you hear us? We're fuckin' crazy!
All of us! Hi… bye… goodnight, somethin'



All i got to do is throw any word at you, you can take any word and just rhyme wth it, i'm like..

Whatever
Technical

Technical? I had spectacles back in school, yo, you just expect a fool
If you try to clam with me, if you ain't down with me, and i ain't tryna have you around me

Traffic emergencies

Traffic emergencies, tragic emergencies, it's an urgency, it burns when i pee, i'm the illest MC, from the motherfreakin D, the 3-1-3

Misproduction

The misproduction, rappers get sucked up into suction, cause they suck when they called up the station tryna bust for 30 seconds, yo slim shady, i mate hit records

Discombobulatorboobulator

Discombobulatorboobulator, yo, i get your b**** inflated, like Pamela Leigh, she wants to sample a pee, from me, doesn't matter cause she f'd the camera...


....tremendo mind state

The mind state of the crime rate, will elevate, when i accelerate, i levitate, give me another word, don't let me say rhymes, that your mother heard...

... supercalafragilisticexpealidocious

Supercalafragilisticexpealidocious, i smacked women with a closed fist, yo, i punch 'em, right in the nose when i be scrunchin, at the function, at the family function, or at ya picnic, give this ick quick, i'm willing to say, D infront of it, but rappers they don't want none of it, cause any MC i'll put on this verbal punishment..

"No, these aren't hickeys" I'm like
"You've been fooling around, I can't have it you"
She's done this to me before
I wish you could just, help me, like

[Intro: DJ Green Lantern & Eminem]
Fucker
Yeah
Oh shit, it's the evil genius
Green lantern
Yeah
Ayo, Em
Ha ha
What we call this shit right here?
The Invasion!
You have Part One, you got Part Two
Now it's
Part three
The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go

[Hook]
I got a riddle: what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, so sorry yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Lloyd Banks]
Hold up hold up hold up
New York city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homie
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green, come on
Countdown to

[Eminem]
Armageddon
Lets go

[Hook: Eminem]
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, so sorry yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one more (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be seen
And i got what it takes  to rock the mic right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts



[Part I: Arose]

If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definite—wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things—time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

[Part II: Castle Extended]

(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider them last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'—now I know

Toilet flush



[Verse 1: Proof]
Who started the mimic, whack
The gimmick, whack
Jimmy cracked corn [?]
Give ‘em smacks
Perhaps the copycats
Had no better turns
[?]
Lost his sense of balance
The lame brain put more into the game
[?] fame
And I’ll drop something proper
By slammin’ the hammer down like Judge Wapner
And after this [?] face me
Throwing’ the blows heavy
So if you’re Chevy, don’t chase me
Where’s your motivation
Taking up your spare time
[?] air time
Don’t you think you know the station
So why [?]
[?]
Grab a parachute to rock bottom
Let the real rappers [?]
Here comes the main course

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Hurah, hurah, ha, haha, ha
Good God [?] bye, bye, bye
[?]
[?] stuff that’ll make you stop and drop
[?] ‘Cause you haven’t [?] before
It’s probably because I have a different kind of outlook
That creates a totally different type of output
So stay put you crook and save the book
Are we going become [?]
And so many rappers are giving credit [?] go
But there’ll be none of that repetition here
[?] uncle [?] mission clear
At the dinner [?] run over [?] past you
You better seek a savior
Alert to run fast, yeah
Basement Productions is definitely in the house
Now my fellow figures
Let’s go to the question
Where, oh, where has our hip-hop gone?
[?] we got a yellowish [?]
We got to work together to end the [?]
To send the [?] back out

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Not a happy camper
‘Cause somebody put a damper
On my spirit, tamper
Now I’m [hamper?] with [interference?]
We fell asleep and let the drawbridge unguarded
Now we’re being bombarded by garbage
So I seriously think your [?] really needs a good boost
‘Cause you got me so bored I feel like a piece of wood
So I’mma break it to you gently
It doesn’t make you a rapper ‘cause [?]
Oh no
This kind of stuff takes practice
You can’t lift weights for first time in your life and expect to be Atlas
So I really recommend you find yourself a new outlet
‘Cause you’re wearing out your welcome like an outfit
So the real ones I keep a close relationship
I no longer have to be in association with
The rappers that are rappin’ [?] and rhyming like a [principle?] [?]
‘Cause this is the type of stuff that’s been bumpin’ us off the schedule

[Verse 4: Chaos Kid and Eminem]
Spoken like a [?]
[?]
No charging at the door we charge the margin for
No tellin’ 'em [?] makin’ my ear drums numb
While they’re making a career from
Judy has a big booty
Stutterin’ like Porky Pig
Rapping the [?] booty
You can’t blame it on one and say he did it
‘Cause the pop was flat before you put the ice in it
And now it’s time to break out the gats and throw it up in your face until you shut your [?] ass
So stop getting dumb and play smart
Grow a hundred legs like a centipede
[?] K-Mart
[?]
Before you go take a piece of my heart

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking: "If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani she sold out
‘Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now, because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Interlude: Eminem]
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo!
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?"
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuckin' Father Time
It ain't never gonna stop a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m going back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows



[Intro]
Wow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? Please, I'm a human being
I have needs! I'm not done, not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph, the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh, so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
'Cause there's a puppet on my hand (hahaha!)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say, "ass" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word "pee-pee"
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Outro: Eminem, Dr. Dre, & Triumph]
Woo!
Fuck is wrong with you?
Ha!
Hey blondie, I saved your peroxide ass again!



[Chorus]
(I don't know) Yes, man
(Why this world keeps turning) As the world turns
('Round and 'round) We all experience things in life
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
(I don't know) That we all must go through
(Why this world keeps turning) When someone wants to test us
('Round and 'round) When someone tries our patience
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)

[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me outta reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, "It wasn't me, I got a twin"
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ahh)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) As the world turns
(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives
('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day

[Verse 2]
We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, "What up? It's nice to meet ya" (Hi)
"I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
"I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now"
She said, "Come in, it's unlocked"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, "Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, "Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best"
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning
(I don't know why this world keeps turning)



[Hook: Eminem]
The lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum
I said the lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I walk around with OJ's glove knowing it fit
Fif to the toilet we taking over this shit
The Yaowa waited, salivated like man I know I can spit
I was knocking for quite some time but you wouldn't open this bitch
You turn green when I enter, probably can't breathe
Now y'all trees in the winter, nobody can't leave
For all those that was doubtful I got a scalpel
And a mouthful of vowels to make a party stampede
You brag about swag and your feminine trends
I belittle your riddle you Skittles with Eminem's friends
So I ain't trying to play with you, this chainsaw crack jokes
On Cain's brother brah, disable you
I'm an untamable animal with aim from a moving train
I could graze your decaying tooth
And my straight jacket just came unloose
I'm reporting live this is (BREAKING NEWS!)

[Hook: Eminem]
The lunatics now run the asylum

They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it

They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Psycho, like no, bitch made, nigga so
This grave, digga go, insane
I got the switchblade to your throat, move it's not smart
I'll slice and watch you bleed all over the pop charts
Me and the Slaughters run the asylum, I'm feeling
Like DiCaprio rapping on Shutter Island
This industry is pussy, guess who's gonna hit it the meanest
Give her the penis, hit the bitch in her Venus
To this game I'm addicted and fiendish, I'm predicted to bring this
G shit to it's pinnacle zenith, lyrical genius
So sick with ridiculous English, niggas get squeamish
When they hear this criminal linguist
Fall back it's the take over, y'all wack and ya cake over
I escape from the padded room, grab a broom and rape a male rapper's womb

[Hook: Eminem]
The lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum
I said the lunatics now run the asylum

They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9]
I've witnessed the worst happening
The hurt moment when I'm purse snatching
I'm perp going berserk boning Miss nurse Ratched
When we spit you get the pug face
Your bitch swallowed my five dollar foot long on the subway
If sane people are rich why should I sit around?
Play me and end up like the back of this hospital gown, ass out
Drink drink drink drink, pass out
Y'all feel me right?
When I was young I was loud, I used to be like "I'LL KILL YA!"
Now I be like "You know I'll kill ya right?"
If y'all don't like it y'all can lick my dick
'Cause we built this house we live in brick by brick

[Hook: Eminem]
The lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it

[Hook: Stat Quo]
I'm the next one next one
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me with me
Got a problem shorty come get me
Nah, I ain't Dr. Dre, nah, I ain't Eminem or 50, dog I’m Stat

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
As I think back, retract, from the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum, bein' broke
Fuck, with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem
I was trying to get on demo tapes state to state
Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hopin' my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting (?)
I would wait for these A&R’s say I ain’t grind bitch
Spendin' my last dime on this studio time shit
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for trying this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot, scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort

[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I'm patiently waitin', used to get love
Now the same niggas hatin', wanna give me slugs
Partner don't get it separated or twisted, you can't fade it
Stat's the wrong motherfucker to play with, understand me

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you opened up your ears long enough to listen
You may hear what you've been missin' out all of this time
I've been put in a position to put all this in position
So quit your bitchin', learn how to rhyme
Get signed and get your shine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like this and like that and, uh, welcome to Statlanta
Shady Aftermath and, uh, a brand new rapper from Atlanta
Who goes by the name of Stat Quo
Introducing our new excuse to keep producin'
Continue to do music, use it and expand it and make rap grow
The hottest new shit on the planet, on a new plateau
But don't confuse it, you don't understand it
Let me break it down for you to show you how we do shit
So that you cats know, this is Statlanta 101
Cause we don't want no one walking out this motherfucker with tunnel vision
So anyone with questions you want answered
Just ask and we'll try to unmask them and maybe explain why so few cats blow
Just spit the truth when you get in this booth and do that though
That there boy hot to death, you already knew that though
Is he the greatest from the ATL, we got haters all day to debate us
So we'll just say this: he's one of them not to tackle

[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I got caviar wishes, box Chevy dreams
CD covers, TV screens
The booth or the block, might go to triple beam
I'mma make it right, hear me, huh huh huh
Fuck what your saying, God put me here to shine
Going on tour or white collar crime
The rhyme or the grind, MPC or the nine
I'mma make it, I need mine, huh huh huh

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
I can care less, fuck yall, you don't make or break me
Real niggas love me, pussy niggas hate me
Down bitches ride for Stat Quo, they know
The A-Town D Young County be trill folk
Didn't no other label offer me no deal
Till they found out Shady/Aftermath was interested
Then they started to beg, want the truth, there it is
This ain't a gimmick, this the south and I be that kid
Just ride through watching lines of his rhymes
In time you're going to find you're on a great trip
Ain't a word I could life be some extraordinary shit
The piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo, you son of a bitch

[Refrain]



[Verse 1]
Ayo I'm focused, it's the locust
O. Trice is holding the soldiers, the prognosis
Probably why I rose from zero to hope
Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach
Nigga, hold the toast you provoke
44 Snub hugs my scrotum when I roll
Yes I hold my own, so if you think you Deebo's clone
I'm aimin, watch I'm switchin to Damon
And Next Friday I can bet you's a changed man
When them thangs in hand, it's not a game man
I ghost ya, I bring ya much closer to Jehovah
Definition of a soldier, I told ya
I, hold the toast when I approach
It's close at all times by my side in the holster
O-ster roast ya, make me blow my composure
Pop, it's all over, when the 44 blows and goes a..

[Hook]
When I'm up in the club and these niggas, they wanna act tough
'til they get plugged, watch them bullets go...
Now you touched from a slug, huggin the streets like you in love
Your heart rate's like...
The ambulance arrive
They rush you to the 'spital, flyin by my ride, engine like...
Homie you just died, your family through crying
I pulled off a crime, just as quick as...

[Verse 2]
You could lose your face, in a fool's race
I pulled my tool first nigga, you was in second place
And second place just means you didn't react with haste
And this differentiates life where murder being the case
And since murder was the case, it just means niggas erase
Another black mother can't eat the food on her plate
Cause she ain't got the taste as if raising you was a waste
"Such a short span young man" said at your wake
First I'm a man, second I'm five eight
But size and weight won't give a nigga the upper hand
Cause when I pop, I give this up like Barry Sand
Sit in the can, he never ran like Barry Sand
Obie ain't playin, Obie got a plan
And the plan is not to be layin in earth's land
I will pop before decayin in earth's land
You get shot for playin me less than a man, mothafucka

[Hook]
When I'm up in the club and these niggas, they wanna act tough
'til they get plugged, watch them bullets go...
Now you touched from a slug, huggin the streets like you in love
Your heart rate's like...
The ambulance arrive
They rush you to the 'spital, flyin by my ride, engine like...
Homie you just died, your family through crying
I pulled off a crime, just as quick as...

[Verse 3]
Niggas get it twisted, liquor make 'em envision
That gangsterism is disrespecting a niggas wishes
Which is all that tough talk in front of bitches
Yeah you fifteen deep, the Desert E'll give ya stitches
And I can be all the bitches and hoes you wanna
But I warn ya the Glock could make it hot as California
You be popped on the corner, flesh meeting in the coroner
O's in quarantine, cause no holes in me
An' since no holes in me, niggas take advantage
'til I manage to pull that hammer out, they start scattering
I'm no gangster, I'm a average man
But be damned if I let 'em do me savage man
Before that I'm strapped and will challenge him
Cock back and that gat will damage them
It's not a act, this is fact, this is how I'm programmed
This is me, what I'm about, this who I am, motherfucker

[Hook]
When I'm up in the club and these niggas, they wanna act tough
'til they get plugged, watch them bullets go...
Now you touched from a slug, huggin the streets like you in love
Your heart rate's like...
The ambulance arrive
They rush you to the 'spital, flyin by my ride, engine like...
Homie you just died, your family through crying

[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and Münchausen, I'ma make you
Wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: "Ouch! What the fuck you hit me for?!"
Screamed life as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hoodie with a scythe, shit, I laughed in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like, "Take this!
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch! Don't take shit
For granted, and don't take shit, give it!"
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford
And Mighty Thor, I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the la-bor-atory, stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant "in half", oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but—

[Hook]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 2]
What goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
And Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words? An erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but you don't rap the same (Yeah!)
And you're lookin' way thinner 'cause your hunger got you lookin' like
They took away dinner (Chicka) "Sugar Ray" Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a (chicka) what? (chicka) GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips, hope it lands on
Another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit anything of wit
That's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit
How low can you go? Lower then Chuck D, ho
Hear the bassiness in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrians?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
To rap; I'm not a man, I'm a weapon who just happened
To be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly
One, evilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-
-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled

[Hook]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 3]
So step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like
An inside of an engine while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper you'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up "rhyme" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
"Eminem" is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes, edumacator (They are)
Shit, legends are made of, spit treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman with metham-
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' themselves in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head exam-ed, Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan
I need meds, swear to God 'cause if I go off the edge
T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man
Heart-throb that’ll fart, ah, nah
More like a smart slob, part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Wal-
-Mart walls, little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'
There's nothing on this fuckin' Earth better than bein' the
King of the playground, I hate the swings, but I love bein'
An underdog 'cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah!)

[Hook]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya



[Intro: Bizarre]
Time waits for no one
It's time to be a man

[Verse 1:  Bizarre]
If your got kids, you know what I'm talking 'bout
But do like I did and just walk the fuck out
For 10 years I been smoking crack
But now I'm back to get my litte girl back (hey there)
I'm on 8 mile with an attitude, science said work for full
Butt-naked in the noon (damn)
Forced to be a man with nowhere to go
Shit I just stopped smoking crack an hour ago
With the hope and a prayer my life is finished
I never smile cause I need to see a dentist (damn)
It was all good when mama was paying the rent
But she died to weeks ago in a car accident
And when the fuck the find me in the cardboard box
With dirty socks, drinking a bottle of scotch
I want cock so bad I suck your grandfathers cock
Give me that rock or get sucked!

[Hook: Eminem]
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(Time for me to be a man)
I watch her grow up with pride
(step up and take irresponsibility)
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(It just all happens so fast)
I watch her grow up with pride
(what I wanna do?)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
My little girl wants to be a ballet dancer (dady)
Last week she was diagnosed with cancer
It took me 2 years to spot it
And the cancer she got, ain't nobody got it
And I'm trying to stay strong, I want my little girl to live long
Thats why I'm writing poems and writing songs
Health insurance they ain't paying no cash
Thats why I'm selling glass, If I have to I'll sell my *ass*
Look at me an irresponsible father and been here
For half an hour and ready to run like a coward
Lord please don't take my little girl's life
So she can skate on ice and learn how to ride a bike

[Hook: Eminem]
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(Yeah I love my little girl)
I watch her grow up with pride
(Watching her grow up)
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(Takes a real man to stick around)
I watch her grow up with pride
(The fuck I wanna do?)

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
She been up all night crying and hurting and the chemical theory
It ain't working and I can't afford the operation
Not even if I rob a gas station
Looking dirty, stanky and beat in the shower
I don't smoke cigarettes, I'm killing a pack in an hour
My little girl said "daddy I'm going to have it"
Look at my princess, fighting, only 7
Any minute my daughter can pass away
And her favorite group is B2K
Sing motherfucker! sing! sing motherfucker!
"gotta be that one that you deserve
Gotta be the one that you can hold
Gotta be gotta be your everything, don't kill me Bizarre!"
Hahaha, you little motherfuckers
"if you got kids, what the fuck would you do?"
This ain't Bizarre, this is John Q with a loaded 22. (bow!)
Me and my TEC-9, I load her and cock her
Everybody going to hell, even the doctor

[Hook: Eminem]
My baby girl, keeps getting older
I watch her grow up with pride
(The fuck am I supposed to do?)
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(I mean, I mean what would you do in this situation?)
I watch her grow up with pride
(I'm just a product of the world)
My baby girl..

[Intro: Police Scanner]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

[Verse 1]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 2]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!"

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 4]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint, in my mouth
Then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 5]
Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

[Police Voice]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off



[Intro]
The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha, ride

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's past noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you-

[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
He was shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said, "Take ten paces," shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
You need bullets, hurry up, run
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do? It's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?
(The Chronic)
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who?
Some old dude who's got 26 plaques
And he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a "G Thang"
And a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin'"
I said, "It's Dre's day," and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled

[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
The life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die (Always die)

[Outro]
The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha-ha, ride, ha



[Verse 1: Eminem]
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn’t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (And actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (Things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I’m confused
Because—

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got… thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn’t mean
The words that we meant that we didn’t say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin’ still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade & Eminem]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there’s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Shit, it's no wonder

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]
How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband



[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!)

[Verse 1]
Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world, and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white journalist
In a room with Lauryn Hill human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot and people'll feel me
'Cause I'ma still be The Mad Rapper whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get
One mic in The Source and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back strikin' at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off: even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit, I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death, as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Chorus]
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 3]
My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull
So bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9"

[Verse 1: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uhh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Ohh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

[Chorus: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

[Verse 2: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

[Interlude: Eminem]
Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, what’s up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & Eminem]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)

[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?

[Eminem]
Arsonist, blocking a fire hose where the nozzle is
Go to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive
Take it home, pour it in a cup and drink lots of it
Trying on your mother's clothes, trying to get these bras to fit
When she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet, with
A﻿ knife, hiding so quiet she'll probably hear the faucet drip
All my life I've been a foster kid
So if I die an early death suicide's gon' be the cause of it

[Royce Da 5'9]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
Then one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet
Spittin shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play

[Eminem]
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

[Eminem]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vein

[Royce Da 5'9]
The disaster wit dreds
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
I got a lot of evil; I got knowledge peeking out of my cerebral now that I got people locked and rock evil
While still on the beat, I hit you in your ribs so hard to think its just a touch to the floor, while your still on your feet
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
Destroying the track, un-employing the whack, exploring the facts while my man Eminem is withdrawing from crack

[Girl voice crying]
I just love him..
I just love him..

Arsonist, blocking the fire hose where the nozzle is
Go to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive
Take it home, pour it in a cup, and drink lots of it
Tryin' on your mothers clothes trying to get these bras to fit

(Crying)

(Eminems Verse)
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down
Well I'm out now, and this time I'm comin back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'mma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe



[Intro]
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

[Verse 1]
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad

[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag

[Verse 3]
In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman
Holding a Glad bag, oh, bagpipes from Baghdad

O,O,O,O,O
I think this
Obie Trice (7X)
O,O,O,O

[Obie Trice: Talking over Hook]
I'd like to reintroduce myself, haha
If you don't know by now. It's Obie Trice man

[1st verse]
I came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo
Made him a monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa
Hated the po po, locally known as abominable snow-o
Later the big 4' rated the home where I made the dough grow
So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros
Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you
We as a people heated in evenings doing these evils
Gotta eat to, be cool, got a kid to feed did it reach you
Or did it seep thru? Or do I just speak thru the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel?
When niggas on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cop when they caught by the cops
Young 2Pac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away
Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free, that's why I'm

[Hook]
[Obie talking over Hook]
Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it
Slept it, lived it, now I spit it
Shady

[2nd verse]
Working that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on
Trying to get rid of the pounds, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on
Same old song, young nigga thats trying to get some where I come from
Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function
In conjunction with selling this substance
Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven
I'mma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me
But currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency
Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing
It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be
Such a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me took to see
I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me
[Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally
And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me
To confirm and unblur my dreams
Best believe since burst on the scene, I'mma be here certainly
With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'mma get this cheese and that's why he's

[Hook fades out]

[Obie talking over Hook]
That's why I'm
That's what made me
Haha
That's why I'm
Young black man in America
Get up and get yours nigga
I know you struggling man, I been there
I see you
Get up and get yours nigga
Ain't no looking back now

Plus, I got so much candy paint in my rims
Paint be flyin' off my car be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, there go the candy man
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'
Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
Thirty-two inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat, custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, ah, there go them superstars
Hit every single store, flash a fuckin' wad of cash

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner liquor store to get Corona, tip the owners
Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up
And I'mma hit the cinema and I'mma get the hoes
When I be at a theater shit, anything goes
I'm ballin' outta control, girls know I'm loaded with dough
But shit, I'm stingy as fuck, I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes
These bitches don't get a crumb, and it come but I'm like what up
Shut up, bitch, sit up, get up off them knees, my candy paint's enough
If you're lucky, I'll let you hug me, but that's all you get
Then I'mma split, disappear, a cloud of smoke is all you see

[Hook]
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ba-ba controllably

[Verse 3]
Bitch, get the fuck out my car if we ain't finna fuck

I'll fuck a chick in the butt, I really don't give a shit
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a bitch
You fuckin' keyed up my Benz bitch, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I fuckin' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV
Turn around and use it on me, you tryna snort all my keys
You fuckin' brat, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me
Tell your momma I'mma drop you off at the hospital later

[Outro]
Tracy, I joined this class cuz I thought I’d be cooking with a partner
But she’s never here, and I don’t get twice the credit for all the work

I didn't invent odd numbers Seth

I know, but I’m over here in my unit, every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan, I mean look at him, it looks like the most fun I’ve ever seen in my entire life. And, I’m just saying, I wash and dry, I’m like a single mother. And, no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and it’s bullshit, but uh no offense, I’m just saying. And I’m not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There’s 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing. OH MY GOD that’s like the coolest fucking story I’ve ever heard in my life, it’s insane. Can you tell us again? Do you have time? Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? I’m in the car right now. Listen, I am McLovin, yeah. McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah



[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is

No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is

[Verse 2: Knoc-turn'al]
Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leaving
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)



Bust it
The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season
My phenomenal legion will shoot out
Your fuckin' abdominal region
Slim Shady, responsible for your permanent stillness
Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness
Itchin' to rip your fuckin' frame out
Cuz I ain't got nothing to lose
Like that movie that just came out
Callin' your name out, first, last and your middle initial
Your mom, your dad, and your pregnant widow will miss you
And anybody else poppin' some shit'll go witchu
Cuz I ain't tryna hear it like a political issue
So until I can leave with enough funds
I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones
Drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns


And I'mma kill it, just so y'all think
That I can't come of the top
And I be forced to rock unorthodox styles
From off the top of the dome
With a popular poem, forget a damn team
I can stop you alone
Rapper's thinking they putting out
They records cause they sell
But that can't fuck with what me, we doing here with AL
Y'all don't wanna do it, when we kick it
When we kick the fluid
Rappers don't wanna get into it, Y'all knew it
Cause the feds want me, they headhunt me, I'm Ted Bundy
I ain't dead, I just fled country
Said bluntly, a cannibal, animal, fed monthly
Eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy
Head's lumpy, funky like a dead skunk be
Med flunkie, jump off cliffs with thread bungee
Wearing red undees and a black cape
Rollin' through the hood cracked out
Bumpin' your whack tape
I'm coming through dumpin'
Change your rap name to Richard Jewell
Cause you ain't blowing up nothing
I'm showing up puffin', throwing up drinkin'
Killing brain cells till I'm slowing up thinking
Growing up stinkin', born with bad odor
Gimme Hennessey but please don't add soda
Now who's doper? You couldn't beat me when I'm sober
I'm off my fuckin' rocker like your Grandma tipping over
Slim Shady


"Son, where you from son?"
"Yo, I'm from Detroit city"
"Uh huh"
"I'm bout to do a little something like this
A little something like this."
"Ok, drop that shit."
"Bust it, bust it"

Yo, I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in the Source
Yo, they never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
Till they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
(Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig
And stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Forget the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this girl in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, girl you so big
You stepped, walked into Vic Tanny's
And stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Picked that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And threw her up to the highest
Diving board to toss her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this girl face down and watch her belly flop, cause it's like that
And I come in and I start wildin' and shit
Then I be busting a lyric
And rappers don't believe I'm freestyling it
Well here it goes when I'm kicking lyrical flows
From your head to your toes
So that every rapper in this place knows
Cause when it comes to the freestyle
Coming off of the top of the dome
I'm knocking your mouth and ya off, so who you copying off?
Stop being soft, I'm standing on top of your loft
Killing you off slowly, like Roberta Flack
I've never heard of wack
MCs that try to step to me, I'll break your verta-back
Or vertebrae, increase the murder rates
In 79 states... Yo, check it
I'm bout to pass the mic to the next
MC who wanna step up and flex
With the techs, but make sure your shit is fresh
Come on, wreck it, who wanna be next?


It goes like this:
Broke the rubber, busted a nut up in your mother
So how do you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker, talking trash like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out your track
I'll smack her up and fucked her
Always talk shit high, smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die, just for walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfucking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Droolin' at the way your jewelery sparkles
Head full of charcoal, smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read, disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes from smashing up
Cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms, chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous, liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off, aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits


Set it off
Rappers get beheaded if they soft
Yo they get they wires crossed
Rappers try to step to me but I'm so ill I'll fire your boss
And this is all freestyle, killing it
While I'm filling it with adrenaline, rappers be feeling it
Like it was braille, so y'all can touch me anywhere
Cause I want you to feel me,
Rappers wanna kill me, but they don't thrill me
So check it, I'm bout to wreck when I make the record
Cause I'm, skinny like an anorexic girl headed for the exit
Running butt naked away from just being date raped
Rappers? I twist 'em into a great shape
And throw 'em in the Great Lakes
'Cause I'm from the Michigan state
For fishermans' sake, I throw 'em and toss 'em in
Rappers try to step to me
But this is the Holocaust and you'll never win
Cause I've forever been bent, forever demented
Rappers try to step to me but their shit is sweet-scented
And I'm demented, and if I said it I meant it
Killin' any MC cause I'm Infinite, and when it
Comes to the way that I'm spittin' lyrical infinite ammunition
And putting a clip in this lyrical track that I just be rippin'
Crushing it, killing it, taking your best line and hushing it
Taking your shit and flushing it down the toilet
Taking your biggest plot and foil it
Rappers can't uncoil it, I'll take my shit and aluminum foil it
Then throw it in the microwave and watch burn up
'Cause I'mma blow up
Rappers? I make 'em ill enough to throw up
Don't show up if you come to the battle


"Can I speed it up? Just a little bit?
Alright that's cool. Alright
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
This one for Quest."

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit changed
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science
Motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards
Like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your
Ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in the hospital and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit
And do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma no a head-butt so hard, I knock us both out
No doubt



[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit or come to grips with the fact
That I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow, one tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man-servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place
Every school I went, I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At eight years old; I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful



[Intro]
Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows
It’s a very mean and nasty place and I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it
You, me or nobody, is gonna hit as hard as life
But it ain’t about how hard ya hit
It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward
How much you can take and keep moving forward
That’s how winning is done

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out of my slump
I wished it was easy to go over this hump
But something keeps me going back to my dump
I got my scars
My arms are numb
I'm so alone, I feel like I'm on my own
My sweetie left me, come back my Hun
I miss your shine, come back my sun
Nobody sees that I'm not fine, I feel like a bum
I got no true friends, I'm on top of a building, I'm ready to jump
The only solution in my eyesight is a bottle of rum
Tick, tock, there goes the clock
Time flies by and I'm gettin' bolder
I meant older, 'cause I've always been shy
People say I'm a joker, 'cause I'm funny
But the truth is
I feel like I'm the only one being silly
'Cause I'm often ignored
I deduce that, I'm invisible to everyone, since no one asks how I'm doing
But when they do, they be like
"Let's go out!"
Nah man, I'll just take this pill to start wildin' out
I'll cough blood 'till my eyes be red, and then I'll pass out

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
It's, It's just a feelin' I got
It's like an overdose
Every fucking day, It's like it overflows myself
I don't wanna whine, but your strength is not like mine
It kinda looks like I've lost my shine everytime I try to breathe (yeah)
I don't feel the same after you, were the
Revival of my, youth
Now I have to pay for the wasted phone calls
And, I'm taking my heart out
And writing our sentences in this crooked wall of mine
Fuck everything
I, wasted my mind
My whole fucking life for you, ain't even gonna apologize to me
For all the bullshit texts
But don't defy me bitch, 'cause from the dirt, I will rise
And the wrong path you chose, recognize



[Intro: Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, ‘cause—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the
Mourning process, and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it
And poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past standing at inferno and chant

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died ‘cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down
‘Cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief it's like watching the walls
Melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

[Hook: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you



[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?



((UNRELEASED))

[Eminem]
Yo, guys! Do you know what is this:
It is old and ugly as fuck
It looks like mutant froggy duck
He's a prick, he's a cunt
And he never smoked blunt!

[Kuniva]
Maybe Michael Jackson, hahahah...

[Eminem]
No...

[Proof]
I know, that dude is Nelson Mandela!

[Eminem]
No, guys! It is Benzino!

[Everybody]
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA...



[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 2]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!

[Scratch]

[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah



Music.

I had met Paul, Em's manager, a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road. We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.

We were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.

And I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.

It reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done. But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.







[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say,, boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say, boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son,, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem & Yelawolf]
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem
To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked, so I might say something back
That might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then you might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause
I'm a sinner, and I, I got a best friend, best friend
Plus balls and intestines, and they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up the minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
'Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend
Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power, now
When I blackout, power outage—oww
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you—blaow
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
Somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah



[Verse 1: Mos Def]
For sinners, saints and scramblers and gamblers
And dirty money handlers, dignitaries and champions, narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketeers
Stars of stage, page and cameras, slang swingers and swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles
Europe, Asia, and Africa, all the time in America
Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, Medina mastermind set
Ya can't lock my set, now lock off, cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun, Moon and Stars, furthermore born knowledge go hard

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing seeds
Let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it
And did it because I need it
Eat, sleep it, and bleed it
Write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement
Your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay them out like a Tempurpedic
Black Thought, I told you I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
Face it, I keep doing it well
Doing it sans assistance, is do it yourself
Doing it below the radar, we doing it stealth
Doing it again for Illadelph and who else
But check it out
Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
Swimming with them great whites now is how to find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla, bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You’re just hoping he don’t get rope for your throat to choke anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fucking bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama
It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the fucking drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fucking cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
Tell Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture
Of my genitalia with a note saying "bitch, I can't wait to nail ya"
Drug paraphernalia
Beware, the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in the sheep's clothes, he just shaved his hair off, Cecilia



[Intro: Eminem]
Welcome to Detroit
This is the BET, Shady 2.0 Cypher 2011
Myself, Slaughterhouse, and Yelawolf
White Dawg, get 'em!
(Thank you, cracker king!)

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Put these mothafuckas in a box, then I send 'em away
Put 'em in a gray 'llac and pop the trunk
And throw 'em in the back, jack; ha, dig 'em a grave
Put a brick inside that Xerox when I print up a page
Movin' keys I can relate, 'cause I live in the cage
I throw up the A, I take 'em to school, I give 'em a grade
An easy E for effort; that's WWA
White with an attitude, alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is Z's, they sleepin' on me, I can't get 'em awake
I spoon-feed 'em a sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
Who believe in makin' it rain 'cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the VIP like a potato
With a bunch of meatheads like, "Fuck it, I'll just feed 'em a cow."
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater
'Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic
But what it's like to pick a fight with me
Is like puttin' Nikes on a cheetah
Better speed up, or at least in my case Adidas
I'm out this bitch, drinkin' Sprite by the two-liter
Holler! Shady Records…

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Say I'm from the new school
I'ma say, "Check your tone and watch your mouth!"
If they teachin' how to Dougie, I'm condonin' droppin' out
Forced to wild, y'all birthed me, then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hop's foster child; now check it
Don't blame y'all for being trash, fans are coppin' it
The radio's the crime scene, the masses are the hostages
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fad was dodgin' it
I'm grown, I ain't watchin' the throne, I'm sabotagin' it
You see that four-headed monster in the storm looms?
Snipe 'em from a distance; the scope got a long zoom
You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure here you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be 'bout
I'd have took the wine outta Amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats 'bout cockin' a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I got this chick from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she doubt David is Stern
She's so bad, I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the Holiday Inn, learned that from Max B
That's why the haters envy, kinda wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes, like I was Benihanas
Is it me, or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?
Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical
My skin's thick, so the critics ignored
So unafraid to die you'd think I did it before
The boy's Rodman with the trash talk
Magic or Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws, glass jaw
Hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no passport
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trapdoors
If punks had award you status whores categore
Probably be that of awards
Between Michael Rappaport and Kenny Lattimore
I know hip-hop's alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
I spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin'
I caught him slippin', I gotta give him a shot, I hit him
With proper spittin', hottest writtens and compositions
So competition's a contradiction
Somebody mention they got a Crooked, highly fiction
We probly different, got Gotti henchmen
Opposition, I'll body quick as Bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get richer, the sickest lyric-kicker
Diggin' a ditch for different spitters
Weak lyricists get disfigured
Sip liquor, spit like a sick mixture
Of Notorious, Pun and L; get the big picture?
The poster, I'll roast ya
My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
It's over, control my whole coastal region
Like I'm supposed to, flow is goin' postal even
Open season, heart close to freezin'
Ruthless as Eazy, nigga, approach, I'm squeezin'
Believe me, dopest West-Coaster breathin'
So most y'all hope I'm vegan; nope, I'm beefin'
Rappers need to keep it trill, give me a beat to kill
Too many people still eatin' sleeping pills
People sleepin' on my ether skills
And y'all ain't even real, you 'bout to die in this cypher
Before you die you should do the Jada and leave a will, for real

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this I was movin' crack
Killers y'all become when y'all rhyme, I salute and dap
And if I blink, they'll remove your snaps
You ain't cool, you wack, with your foolish act
Skinny jeans don't mean your ass shoot
It means your booty claps
Don't play like Tyler Perry
This the Slaughterhouse of pain, flow brown, tight and heavy
When it come to 16's, I'm a fiend
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writin' bars to Nas' "Thief's Theme"
Gettin' my Yaowa on
Man, all these Olajuwons, we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They fiendin' for us to break, like Beyonce's water
The four quarters doin' all the eatin'
And y'all gotta know why I made the cut, I'm Puerto Rican
Ortiz keep the fire ready; and tryin' to put me out
Is like tryin' to steal a transvestite from Eddie

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm do-or-die dope, and you can make the sticker sittin' on the door of that Phantom your suicide note
Hi, Rihanna! Is Nicki livin' with you?
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi, Rihanna! I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye, Rihanna! Now back to y'all fools
We rock out, like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothin' about Budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why do I keep her, I say it's cheaper to
That's why I ride around in a Rolls, like Wiz Khalifa do
Rappers, I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't kill, but your father will, like Jayden Smith
I tell you like I tell my Spanish chick
You fly, but I ain't going down on no landin' strip
So get your wax on, like Daniel San, or I'ma have to run
Like De la Hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive, I'll headshot him
Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber-sexin' with Jessica Alba via Skype
I’m on my D-boy, Deebo thing
Spiritual steelo swing, like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with your B-Roll bling
You know your flow is wack
We cornered the market, like a Wal-Mart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah, this is what two million singles sold
And an album that's gold
Look like without having to sell your soul
Nickel!

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo, lyrical miracle, spiritual individual, criminal
Subliminal in your swimming pool… (Boooooo!)
You're 'bout to see peace destroyed, it'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your CD stores
Wanna stop it? You gon' need a priest, at least three swords
A license to ill from the Beastie Boys
Three Ouija boards, and a squeegee, and please be warned
Don't ask what the squeegee's for
Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns?
And as for me, you ask when I'm gone, will he be mourned?
Is puke lukewarm? Should Casey Anthony do porn?
Can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a frickin' shoebox with a shoehorn
Smothered in chloroform, so she can go get her groove on?
Can she duct-tape and Velcro a fetus?
Joell, yo, tell Joe I need his
Empty box from his old shell-toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in a fetal position
They're gettin' elbows to the penis
Yeah, big deal, I took some little kid's Big Wheel
And spit in his frickin' big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch, you wench, sit still!
Did you just put your six-inch heel
Through my Benz windshield?!
Is it dust we 'bout to kick up?
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his frigging pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will 'til he gets hicc-ups?
Flippin' the script up, like Mike Vick
Gettin' bit in his junk by a Pit, yup, I'm a sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician, 'cause I'd fuck a trick up
Fix your lips up to say somethin' fly, or zip up!
Aye, B, let's see: you said you were gonna do X-Y-Z
'Til you fuck around and get dropped
Like an E when you add an I-N-G
Don't put a K in front of that, though, when I MC
'Cause I'm not the king of this microphone booth
It's more like a phone booth
Superman in this bitch, Kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power
I bump the Fat Boys and eat rat poison, take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossin' a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit
Will be like Nas doin' gospel or R&B—you crazy?
Me pushin' up daisies, that thought is impossible
As if flashin' across the news
Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson, boobs and a monstrous tube
Of lube, and a bra, some boots
Some panties, and an aqua blue Mazda
Swallowin' a popsicle, playin' tonsil pool
So kill the rumors, it ain’t happenin'; I’ma rap 'til I'm fossil fuel



[Intro]
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
"Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?" You, sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities"

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Outro]
Fuck off my dick



[Intro: Mos Def]
Man, you hear this bullshit they be talking
Every day, man
It's like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what I'm sayin'? It's wild, listen

[Hook: Mos Def + Jadakiss]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga!
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga!
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga!

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I pledge no allegiance, nigga, fuck the President's speeches!
I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drownin' you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Act will track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you and say you was tryna sell drugs
And throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
This shit is run by fake Christians, fake politicians
Look at they mansions, and look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen, but they don't really tell you they mission
They funded al-Qaeda, and now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11? That's just scratchin' the surface!

[Hook: Mos Def + Jadakiss]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga!
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga!
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga!

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit, I'll show you why it's totally wrong
‘Cause if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through Harlem and Washington Heights
I wouldn't be fightin' for Bush or White America's dream
I'd be fightin' for my people's survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga
I'd be fightin' to keep the occupation out, my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit or look at you wrong?
Imagine if they shot at you and was rapin' your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit after Ronald Reagan's election
Mercenary contractors fightin' a new era
Corporate military bankin' off the war on terror
They controllin' the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryin' to distract the fact that they engineerin' the crack
So I'm strapped, like Lee Malvo, holdin' a sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids, and I don't mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue, stripped down and recycled
I fire on house niggas that support you and like you
‘Cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This ain't no alien conspiracy theory, this shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal

[Interlude: Eminem]
I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President dead
It's never been said, but I set precedents

[Hook: Mos Def + Jadakiss]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga!
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga!
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga!

[Interlude: Eminem]
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the Towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours



[Intro: Eminem & Bizarre]
We got something for the bitches
These bitches always be all, giggling and shit
But they get mad when their favorite song don't come on in the club
Catch an attitude and shit
So we got one for them, it goes like this

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We wrote a song for the hoes
You like to hear it, here it goes
A little something you probably won't hear on your radios
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows
And if I'm talking too fast it just means you're listening too slow
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, bitch
Ju jah jah jah dah du ju jah, you just made me mess up, bitch
Blibiri babiler blabber, it don't matter, I'm just blabbering
Like you understand what I'm saying anyway
I'm just traveling in one ear and I'm out the other
You're so fucking drunk all you hear is the beat b-b-beat
I could be saying anything, just get your ass on the floor
Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before
Baby and shake that ass like a whore

[Hook: Eminem & Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass, bitch
Yeah that's it, bitch
Yeah, I called you a bitch, bitch
What you going to do about it, bitch?
Sit there and cry like a little bitch, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass bitch
You little trash, bitch
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, I called you a trash, bitch
Not trailer trash, switch
Take the person you with and exchange partner, bitch

[Verse 2: Swifty]
Tell me that it ain't no hanging and fuck calling home
Until you look at me, before you answer the phone
When I flee, your ass can get naked and be as free
As you wanna be freak, but I'm taking the key with me
You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes bitch I'll beat your ass
Watch me coming home full, eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
And before she cut them on, Kuniva already switched
Your ass ain't even riding with Swift unless you're hoeing
When I'm done, I'll throw you out and ask you where you going

[Verse 3: Bizarre & Eminem]
Ho ain't the only thing you call a girl
Slut, Tramp
Oh, how you doing, Sheryl
Ever since I was eight I been starting to hate
I said fuck the hoes and started eating cheesecake
Scrambled eggs and steak, strawberries and grapes
Damn that sounds great, hold on wait... Bizzy!
Okay back to the bitches, wash the dishes after that
Give me stitches, a fucking half Indian chick, sucked my dick
This time tomorrow, I won't remember shit
Got respect for a player, got on snoop gators
And they ain't Now and Laters, bitch

[Hook: Eminem & Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass, bitch
Yeah that's it, bitch
Yeah, I called you a bitch, bitch
What you going to do about it, bitch?
Sit there and cry like a little bitch, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass bitch
You little trash, bitch
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, I called you a trash, bitch
Not trailer trash, switch
Take the person you with and exchange partner, bitch

[Verse 4 / Skit: Kon Artis, Kuniva & Dina Rae]
Hey baby, what's up with you?
Hey..

Nope

Oh...

Or make me holla for a dolla, just hop in the range
Shh, shit, shut up nigga, no, shut up
Man, fuck both y'all niggas
See I was trying to be polite, stank ass trick
Oh, somebody is jacking off tonight

[Verse 5: Proof]
Oh you a bitch but don't choke
I say the same to my Momma
I got Christina, Britney with me
Shit, we banging Madonna
Watch her strip you on that ten bitch ain't got change for a dollar
Blow your tongue and give this one the mouth you came with a condom
Quick cum is the motto, so just swallow and breathe
Swallow and breathe, now swallow these seeds
I know you mocha lotti Mommies won't get down on your knees
You want some money honey damn you must be outta your weave
Hit the telly fuck her belly you ain't gotta go weak
Plus you wanna be a model you need a lot of more sleep
I'm a pimp bitch don't be shy, show me them big tits
Your lipstick, I want it smeared all on my limp dick
For instance, busting nuts is only my interest
So princess, don't get your feelings hurt cause men just
Party and bullshit till she gargle and swallow the dick
I'm taking the train to spain, don't bother calling me, bitch

[Hook: Eminem & Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch

[Outro: Kon Artis & Eminem]

Hahah!
Wooo! D-Twizzy, yeah!
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!



[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, you know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits
'Til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(Watch out, nigga!)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw
Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
(Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I…

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Eminem]
Somehow, some way
Hello nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns
And I love all of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was?
Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up Slim?)
(What up, Cuz? What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast
Baby

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage
With ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 4: Eminem & Snoop Dogg]
Aw, naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal
Makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like?
And walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home, and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Outro: Xzibit]
2001 and forever
Slim Shady

Snoop Dogg
X to the Z
Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah



[Zoe]
Justin? It's Zoe
Um, Kelly did not have me call
However, I just listened to Eminem in her car
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell them how fucking disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch, goodbye



[Produced by Manix]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sneaking in through the back door
Fruity MCs get ambushed, rammed and squooshed
Slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
Then I'm moving on down from the right to left
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death
To get jacked, attacked, and cracked in two
Smackin' through 'til you're black and blue for actin' true
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
Proof that I've been sniffin' on aerosol cans
I'm stomping, I'm kicking, I'm choking, I'm stamping 'em
Clomping 'em, sticking and poking and clamping 'em
To electric chairs and tightening bolts
Hit 'em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
I'm zapping rappers, singers and dancers
Faster than you can snap your fingers for answers
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathing
Surviving by conniving and thieving

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I had a dream I was getting jacked by biters
It felt like I was being attacked by spiders
Developing a fear of biterphobia
I'm holding a gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya I'ma pulverize
Dissect your brain, diggin' in your skull for lies
And I'ma torture with material iller
Than a stark raving mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist, so beware of the aura
A terror for the horror will scare ya tomorrow
This is an airborne assault of other rappers
Hit the source to better my skills
I head for the border, and run the Galloping Hills
The choice is yours, ‘cause now buddy's noises force
Me to scream 'til my voice is hoarse
‘Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws
And crap that grab at yours
And savage yours to bite like Labradors
In the range of my double-barrel
And your life is in danger, trouble and peril

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I trample and stamp liars like they were campfires
‘Cause vampires bite on my balls, and clamp pliers
And swing on my big thingamajig
So I'm bringing my nig' Proof for backup when I sing at my gig
‘Cause biters are falling head over heels
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewing my fingernails, pulling my hair annoyed
‘Cause every time you bit it was deliberate
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with
An ultimatum, I assault and slayed 'em
With rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate 'em
Energetic and imaginative
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives
Will reach out and grab you, 9 times out of 10
That's why I'm spilling one-of-a-kind rhymes out a pen

[In the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!
Attack!]

This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Who wants to be king?! In this rap game

All hail your new king!
...nope
ME!
...nope
King Harald...
...nope
Hail King Bjorn!
...yeah!

[Around that sea are many wonderful people and places and towns... I want to go there!]

[With me in the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!
Attack!]

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It’s like a joke, he’s like a king, but he don’t rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support, but he ain't begging for it
And you can love it, you can hate it, but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ig-nor-ant, though you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm fronting, man, you better come confront me for it

[You've all come to understand how a young farmer from Norway risked his life to explore the world
We have achieved my father's dream. We have the legal right to the land and to farm!]

[With me in the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!
Attack!]

This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Who wants to be king?! In this rap game

All hail your new king!
...nope
ME!
...nope

...nope
Hail King Bjorn!
...yeah!

[A civil war can only bring tragedy.]

[With me in the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!

[Intro: 2Pac]
Black Cotton, Black Cotton
Black Cotton – a symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tale
Ghetto gospel, that is, listen!
Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Black cotton, steady stressin', Smith & Wessons, count my blessings
Class is in session: the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave?
Never got paid but still we slave (in the nine tre')
Answer that, then answer this too
Love's gonna get ya, you know it's true – life's a bitch, true?
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter, G? Black cat got your tongue?
Fat track got you sprung, now you're hung?
Do ya feel me? Dum dum diddy, is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace, then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seein' bodies on the streets deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies – POOF!
We used to have troops, but now there's no more youth to shoot
God, come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (in God's eyes)

[Chorus: Eminem]
Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my dreams
Drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care (Feels like I'm pressed
Why do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my prayers
Vanished in thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care

[Verse 2: Kastro]
In the belly of the beast I'm bubblin' up
Runnin' out of luck, about to self-destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
You're sure to catch her with your one-day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool, but it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know, I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did to us baby kids
And now we grown up, nobody ain't own us yet

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit, they shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin', but keep in mind, it ain't irkin'
And we ain't stop, it's curtains
You try to rise and certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridaz
What's the reward for a struggler?
If the law lovin' us, then why they hate to see us comin' up?
Runnin' up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove, no love
Waitin' for my 40 acres and a blunt to blaze
Biblical times, good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton – I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton – I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
Black Cotton

[Chorus: Eminem]
Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my dreams
Drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care (Feels like I'm pressed
Why do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my prayers
Vanished in thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care

G-Unit, UTP
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
G-Unit, UTP, G-Unit, UTP
G-Unit, UTP, 50 Cent
Get 'em Buck, man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
50 Cent, that's my name, man I ain't fucking playing
I move on you with that Mac, mane
Come off that watch and chain 'fore I blow out your brains
Shells hit your chest, go out your back, mane
See me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long
Then niggas get laid out
Niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringing them thangs out
Then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
Dumping clips off at their whole clique, mane
When witnesses around they know how we get down
So when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane
My soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that
I'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit that's the gang
Come through here stunting you get popped at

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I came in this game knowing niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
Your niggas can't run cause I'm behind ya
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line, bro
Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire, bro
Right now we smacking 'em with platinum
And they hate it cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for
I represent it cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished
Juvenile, they can't stop us and I admit it I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfucking chopper

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
My twenty-inches spinning, you always see me grinning
And you hear niggas call me grimy
They hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me
When I come back around, man, I'mma back 'em down
I run up busting that TEC, mane
If you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run
My advice is you hit the deck, mane
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane
Cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
And we'll come checking through your set, mane
Man, you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't paying no fucking debt, mane
Cause you's a middle man, what don't you understand?
You's a fucking fake ass connect, mane

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though



[Intro: Swifty McVay]
Hmm, yeah
This just one of them days when yo' ass just wanna chill out
And motherfuckers be all in yo' ear and shit, yknowhatI'msayin?
Or that nagging bitch, that just like to hear herself talk
Blowing all yo' high away
Now that's some fucked up shit, heh
But it happens, yknowhatI'msayin? Yo

[Eminem]
Yo yo yo yo
Schizophrenia, how many of ya got it?
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
How many motherfuckers can say they brain dry-rotted from pot?
You got it like I got it or not?
If you did, you would know just what I'm talking bout
When your tongue's rotting out from cotton-mouth
When you end up becoming so dependent on weed
That you end up spending a G in the vending machine
You got the munchies, look at you, junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat, up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
That's it gotcha thinking the whole world is watching ya
Or maybe you don't smoke, maybe you just roll
But whatever your drug's yo, go for the gusto
Just don't, come fuck with me when I'm doing my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fucking my high up and

[Hook: Eminem/Kon Artis]
Blow, my, buzz
Do what you want to just don't blow, my, buzz
(Do what you want to) And I'm gon' sit here and just roll, my, drugs
(Smoke my weeeeed) And if you talk I'm gonna fuck, you, up
(I might just whoop yo' ass) Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Bizarre]
{*ding dong*} Bitch let me in the house (Avon?)
No, I just came to eat your mother out
It's the big guy, doing a butterfly to the ground (go 'head!)
[Eminem]
Bizarre sit yo' nasty ass down!
[Bizarre]
I spot this fat bitch from across the room
Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (yea yea!)
My face is pink, looking for a sink
And don't worry bout what I put in your drink
It's called a date-rape drug, ten minutes you'll be fucked up
Open your nasty-ass legs up (yeah you whore)
Bitches I'm catching, blunts I'm matching
Don't call me Bizarre, I'm the Reverend Jesse Jackson

[Swift]
Who the fuck is this guy, why the hell you in my presence?
It'd be cool if you was asking me some reasonable questions
But you on some bullshit nigga, this yo' last beer (f'real)
Get the fuck off my dick and tell yo' bitch to bring here ass here
I kick a ho out without giving her cabfare
And leave her barefooted just for nagging in my damn ear
When I'm out eating, you fags'll interfere
They don't go until I let 'em know a mag' is sitting here
I get drunk and I smoke weed, whatcho' ass wanna hear?
I didn't answer you clear, I met Manson this year okay?
You want some yay? I'll front yo' ass a play
But other than that, get the hell out my face
Because you niggas trying to

[Hook 2: Kon Artis] (adlibbing)
Blow, my, buzz (heeeeeeey)
Do what you want to just don't blow, my, buzz
(I'm gonna sit here) And I'm gon' sit here and just roll, my, drugs
(hmmmmmm) And if you talk I'm gonna fuck, you, up
(Shut yo' damn mouth!) Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Kuniva and Kon Artis]
[Kuniva] Yo, Denaun you seem shook
[Kon Artis] I really am dawg - look!
This fat bitch keep chasing me trying to give me the nook
[Kuniva] Aww, man you probably lead her on
[Kon Artis] I just bought her a beer!
[Kuniva] I saw her rubbing on your head while she was wiping your tears
[Kon Artis] I admit, I was high, but you ain't seen me crying
[Kuniva] Nigga, you lying, and you blowing my high, just stop denying it
[Kon Artis] Well at least somebody in this bar is, this big bitch did
The ultimate by saying she wanted to have my kids
[Kuniva] Look man you grown, just leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Call it a night, get stoned, and take that fat slut home
Just drink the drink, hit the dank, do some drugs
Go kill yourself
[Kon Artis] Fuck you!
[Kuniva] Well, stop blowing my buzz!

[Proof]
I'm at the front of the bar by the lounge in the back
With a slut on my arm while I'm downing the 'gnac
Got the pills in my system, floating around
Every time I start drifting, someone open they mouth
Yo my ear been spit licked and freestyled in
I think I'm going def like most senile men
Only one good demo out of three thousand
(Yo I ain't wanna rap for you anyway) A'ight, peace out then!
Next nigga that bump me, I'mma do the Humpty
And elbow bitches, 'til everybody jump me

(Yo man whassup wit you man why you keep bumpin me and shit)
Whassup fool? Fuck you punk!
(Motherfucker, the fuck? It's on fool it's on! Whassup then nigga?)

[Hook 3: Kon Artis] (adlibbing)
Blow, my, buzz (heeeeeeeeeeey)
Do what you want to just don't blow, my, buzz
(Do what you want to) And I'm gon' sit here and just roll, my, drugs
(Smokin', Rollin', on and On...) And if you talk I'm gonna fuck, you, up
(Slap the shit out you!!) Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Outro: Kon Artis]
We'll be cool
We'll be cool if you don't talk while I'm just trying to smoke my weed
Smoke my weed
I'm trying to drink with my niggas; just shut the fuck up
While I'm just trying to get blowed
Spitting to me some mo'.. (hehehe)



12:30 A.M., I was dead asleep
Heard two people screaming outside in the street
It was a guy and his girl, they were having a fight
Still half asleep, middle of the night
Screaming and cussing, that's all you could hear
See the girl's face and it's filled with fear
The screaming gets louder, this has gotta be solved
But I'm saying to myself not to get involved
But it's gotta be done, someone might get hurt
So I grabbed a pair of pants and I throw on a shirt
Heard a shot outside, put my Nike's on
Seen the girl lying half dead on the lawn
I was scared, but in hell of a rage
Went back in the house, loaded up my gauge
Come back outside, girl's still on the ground
I paused for a second and I turned around
Looked up in the dark and I saw a man
Six feet from me, with a gun in his hand
He shot first, but the sucker missed
I was no longer scared, by this time I was pissed
The girl was shot in the head, and I thought she was dead
The whole spot was red from the blood that was shed
I'm still on the ground, the sucker points his gun
I thought I was dead, no chance to run
The girl reaches out from behind the man
Springs herself forward, knocks the gun from his hand
I grab my gauge and ran halfway down the block
Ducked into the alley it was one 'o' clock
He picks his gun back up to continue the chase
Turns around and shoots the girl straight dead in the face
I jumped into a dumpster and I closed the lid
Ain't no motherfucker gonna shoot this kid
He kept on runnin' and he passed me up
I come up from behind him and I said, "What's up?"
The punk turned around and his eyes got bigger
I squeezed the gun tight and I pulled the trigger
Shot him right in the chest, blew him back ten feet
And the sucker laid dead, middle of the street
In the streets of Detroit this happens every day
But fuck with this kid and get blown away



[Bizarre]
Hey..... boys and girls and all you dirty heads out there
Lets take a trip to the world of D12
The hardest Boy Band in the world
Straight from, +DETROIT MICHIGAN+
Come on follow us, come on

(Hook)
If I could just take you through a day with me and you
Then you'll see what I can do, when I do what I do
And I bet, you will not bother me like you do
Cause you find you would rather spend your time B-N-U
(B N U, B N U, B N U, B N U,)

[Mr. Porter]
You think you know it all, don't you dog all about my life and all
While I'm poppin this Vicodin and drinking all this alcohol
All up in these clubs throwing up like I ain't got em' all
But that's just what you see when you see me hanging with Runyan nem
It's funny when, I'm busting my ass gettin them money nem
You ain't never round helping out but soldiers come to them
Runnin to them, wantin 30 niggas long when
You call me to the door I told 'em leading all your friends
And then they talk behind my back again I'm back to doing smack again
I'll have another baby cause safe sex I ain't praticing
Logic by the sleezy sleeze being fake ain't being me
It's just your misconception of perception when you seeing me

(Chorus)

[Proof]
I ain't gotta like you dude, plenty of time to fight you fool
Arrogant? This might be true... smack your bitch - slightly rude
Running from the white and blue for blowing up a bible school
Let me show you what this rifle do, to ill I got a license to
Nice of you to think I'm not, but I'm ill this is true
Poppin pill, shooting guns, going jail - I'll shit on you
Yes I'm ?? touch the wire, fuck and bust a nut in Mya
Kelly didn't touch that girl, then again I'm such a liar
This is me all day, you rubbing me the wrong way
Listen what the song say and pass the fucken Bombay
Andale on the overplay for the underplay
Ondre is more Swift with gunplay, one day
I'm proof next I'm Harry techs I carry on the runway
It's necessary that my sex is very nongay(Hey!)
D12 we don't play with them gays(Gay.....)
Blame it on our momma this the way we was raised!

(Chorus)

[Swifty McVay]
They like to know what I can do, they ain't got the slighest clue
Question my integrity, I mean it nigga who is you
You better be prepared for beef, we don't need a new recruit
We blow a hole inside a nigga bigger than a hulahoop
See I know the business who the hell you talking stupid to?
Fuck you up(fuck you!) have your face looking like a rubix cube
You can walk the hood with me we can take an acid break
All you gotta do is choose, tablet nigga have a drank
Dabble with it rob a bank, (Man this shit and new to you)
What the fuck you niggas think I can shoot as Muslims too
Nigga hey, what about the pretty bitch you call your wife?
I'mma hit it nigga I been sucking titties all my life
Stealing shit and starting fights pissing on yourlawns at night
We hard to get along with stay ornery like Dolamite
Nigga you can be polite, I don't talk to people right
And so does the rest of us, you hating us cause we alike

(Chorus)

[Bizarre]
Hey boys and girls, taking drugs is real cool
Hanging out in the news acting like a damn fool
It's the big guy with the shower cap kicking sicks raps
Talking bout fucking kids in the ass crack
Nevermind Bizarre... you know he's on medication
Smoking weed, drinking brew - third grade education
All in your house, blunt in my mouth
Call you a bitch.. and pee on your spouse

[Kuniva]
Look, I don't like the chitter chatter that's for faggots if it mattered
Then I'd have to splatter rappers just for acting - target pratice
Time for action I'm Kuniva
The wet Vagina finder
So nevermind you rhyming chumps
You might see me behind the pump
And yes it damages I put niggas in bandages
And yes I love my pistol like bizarre loves all his sandwiches
Business is strenuous you fucking with some geniuses
Some many people on my nuts I wonder how my penis is
Girls approach me with bodies like Venus and Serena-esess
I turn 'em down my wife would kill me if she ever seen the shit
I mean the shit, I'm silly man, I'm smart, I'm really ignorant
I'm innocent and guilty at the same time, go and figure it

(Chorus)
*Record stopping slowly*

Battle rap is not boxing!  It's a street fight!

Words...are...weapons

[Megaton (Dizaster)]
We battle rappers!
We battle each other, and disrespect each other in the ring as rappers!

[Bluntz (Loaded Lux)]
If you go off, you a legend for life

[Maya (Rory Uphold)]

You know how sensitive the climate is towards racism and appropriation
The administration is now under a lot of pressure to act...

Shut the FUCK up!

Bob Saget-Rick Moranis-Kelly Osbourne-white trash genetic monster!
Probably conceived in the back of a Led Zeppelin concert
If Harry Potter had sex with Jeffrey Dahmer, you'd be their lesbian daughter!
The FUCK are you!?
A little fuckin' state prison, fuckin' RAPE VICTIM!?
He's the new face of racism
I'm surprised he didn't show up here today with a slave with him, chained to him!
He hates African-American culture 'cause he was raised different!
He hates Clinton, Abe Lincoln...pretty much anybody that can relate with him, except Blake Griffin!
He feels a little bit more safe with him 'cause they share the same pigment!
BITCH! Hip-hop was meant for MINORITIES!
It's NEVER been for you geeky asses!
Matter fact, what are these!?
Your little fucking reading glasses you need for your English classes!?!?
MAN, GIMME THAT SHIT!
Man, I'll stomp these into PIECES, in FRAGMENTS!
And now you can KEEP them!  He can have this!
Now you can complete your dream of being this genius math whiz 'CAUSE EVERYTHING YOU SEE'S IN FRACTIONS!!

[Intro: Doctor & Nurse]
Scalpel
Here
Sponge
Here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Ahh
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

[Verse 1]
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
"I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"
I screamed, "Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse"
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know, my leg, it hurts"
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him"

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die, honky"
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, "Look, bitch, what have you done?"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry, son"
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

[Outro]
Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage

Drugs is what they used to say I was on

[Intro]
Or Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem
"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer. If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit."

[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's usin' your head, Momma always said—

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud, gee, for what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down
And be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin' in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!
And I'm startin' to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch—end of story
Still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void, been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourd there's a Ford engine
Door hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin' board, a bench, a wrench, a ore winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my
Head, just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I
Don't, 'cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said—

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Bridge]
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on the bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top

[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, y'all, fuck it, I'm out cold, now everywhere I go
They scream out, "Go!", I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America
Hear 'em yell out in terror, they were so scared, and those kids
Just about belted out whatever spouted
Or fell out my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah
'Til then, hopefully you little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin'— insert insult here
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and reupholster it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-Oc-
-tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
And get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all
'Cause I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said—

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Outro]
"Insaneness" ain't even a word, you stupid fuck!
Neither is "ain't"



[Chorus: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back

[Verse 1: Proof]
Doing a ron on doctrine and stompin’ oxygen
[?] Nine or ten put a fork through your optic lense
Hittin’ with sudden force, then your boy laying in the same
Puddle of blood [?] blood sport
Smuggle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily [?] some thugs who the future [?]
A double deuce with slugs, and Proof on drugs
Will turn you to a rapper that you used to love
High from your medicine cabinet, pills
Grabbing the steel, leaping off of buildings that haven’t been built
I’m not the best yet, ‘cause I haven’t been killed
I’m laughing at you faggot rappers with deals

[Chorus: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fucking gas for thirty minutes this morning
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day, in a dress with a sex change
I’m having a bad day, my fucking dads gay
I hate fags and I’m fucking mad ‘cause I don’t have AIDS
All I wanna do is die, I tried suicide six times
Couldn’t even do it right
Relaxed had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab with bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve step program
Tripped on the first step, and got pinned down in a choke slam
I sware to God this pop culture comes any closer
I’m kicking his whole fucking wall over
Two more shots and it’s all over
I’m all over this wall, try not to fall over

[Chorus: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
BLAOW BLAOW, shots in broad day
[Bizarre that’s your Mom!]
The bitch shouldn’t have been in the way
Me shady and mic fucking a hermaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin, till late last night
Tell all my boys take turns
[didn't finish transcribing this verse]

[Verse 1]
It's just one of those days
When you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked
Everybody sucks
You don't really know why
But you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact
And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

[Hook]
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit

[Verse 2]
It's just one of those days
Feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac
You better watch your back
'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program
And if you're stuck up
You're just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

[Hook]
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip

I think you better quit talkin' that shit
Punk, so come and get it

[Interlude]
I feel like shit
My suggestion is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
We've all felt like shit
And been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers that want to step up
I hope you know I pack a chain saw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break your fuckin' face tonight

[Bridge]
Give me somethin' to break
Give me somethin' to break
Just give me somethin' to break
How 'bout your fuckin' face?
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw (what?)
A chainsaw (what?)
A motherfuckin' chainsaw (what?)
So come and get it

[Hook]
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit
Punk, so come and get it



Big up to all the Brooklyn massive crew
Some they pay no mind, but now them notice Blu
So take your ones, your fiftys, put your hundreds to your shoes
And to my fans you know I love you

To the top we be chargin'
I'm not leavin' till someone stops rockin'
All the soldiers come back and start marchin'
And I see myself sellin' in black market

You say you love, say you love me
But you're never there for me, yeah, mmm...hmm...
You'll be cryin', slowly dyin' When I decide to leave, oh, oh

All we do is make up
Then break up
Why don't we wake up
And see
When love hurts
It won't work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe

You're only lonely when your homey
Ain't got a ride or no loot, yeah, uh-huh
Then comes the drama
Some other girl is claimin' she's goin' out with you, hmm...hmm...

All we do is make up
Then break up
Why don't we wake up
And see
When love hurts
It won't work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe

Summer, spring, winter and fall
I realize, love don't love me anymore
I'm still walkin' out that door
Waitin' for a cure

I wish that you could love me more
And give me what I'm lookin' for
You used to be the one I adore
But now it seems I'm just not sure

Maybe we need some time alone
So we can just breathe

Breathe (Let it breathe)
Breathe (Breathe, ah...)
Breathe (Let it breathe)
Breathe
Breathe (Breathe)
Breathe
Breathe (Uh-huh)

Hey... hey... hey... hey...
Let it breathe, yeah
Oh... oh... breathe

[Intro: Briefcase Joe & Eminem]
Yeah this is going out to those two yerks from Junior High School who called me Briefcase Joe. Guess what? Now It's come to past that. It's turned out to be a good thing for me.
Yeah, tell 'em!

[Verse 1: Briefcase Joe]
Yo here I go, they call me Briefcase Joe
I write my lyrics down for a keepsake yo
On the microphone, hear the beats they go
You could be the rapper, I'm the DJ yo
My lyrics just erupt like a volcano
Everywhere I walk when I talk they know
I'm flippin' it, dippin' it, trippin' it, rippin' it
Hit 'em with venom in 'em
I gave them an enema
Then hit 'em up right in front of the cinema
Skin them alive {rocking the party}
As soon as the women arrive
Then I'ma drive a stake in their heart (yeah)
And squirt (yeah) lemon in their eyes (yeah, yeah)
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook: Eminem]
Chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka
Briefcase Joe
They call him, they call him, they call him
Briefcase Joe
Chicka, chicka, his name is, his name is
Briefcase Joe
He don't carry that briefcase to school no mo'
Chicka

[Verse 2: Briefcase Joe]
My testicles are vegetables
They're goin' to Mexico
They're on a jet-jetroll yo

[Hook: Eminem]
Chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka
Briefcase Joe
They call him, they call him, they call him
Briefcase Joe
Chicka, chicka, his name is, his name is
Briefcase Joe
He don't carry that briefcase to school no mo'
Chicka



[Intro: Bizarre]
Emceeeeeeees, RUN!
Or get hit with my verbal gun!
This mic weighs a ton!
Dozen battles for fun
I'll disrespect you and your crew
Here comes MC Eye-Kyu!

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Your fakeness is atrocious
Post this deep in yo' hypnosis
Then focus, roll this and smoke this
Like L's of that bomb-ass herb that's guaranteed to rock bells
A hip-hop ReFugee like Prazwell
Travellin' cities pimpin'
Babblin' biddies game trump tight to solidify
Computerized to get rid of spies - know what I do to guys
Shootin' and spittin' lies?
I'm banishin' existance
Just vanish any instances, brandishin' sentences
Provin' repentence is the only way to see me, don't miss these
Me and my crew smoke so many trees that I piss leaves
Never bammer bitch please, but keep smoke in my system
Roll blunts- it's all tight
On a off night, I still smoke like exhaust pipes
And bust a universal flow to blow your wig back
Like niggas with toupees drivin' a convertible
And furthermore I run the board
Yo' shit is played
And the way you fell off, you couldn't bounce back with a bungee cord

[Hook x4: Bizarre]
Bring your boys and, we can bring the noise and
You don't wanna fuck with Dirty Dozen!

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
My crew is like amazed, put in fear like ex-slaves
Who wanna step to this microphone and think that they BRAVE?
Dozen always startin' the fuckin' beef
I don't give a fuck if you from Kansas, I'm still the fuckin' chief
Back the fuck up I'm releasin' my dum-dums
Tell your whore stop pagin me, 9-1-1
I'm a star that they call Bizarre
Smokin' blunts with Mel Farr in my brand new car
What nigga in their right mind wanna see me?
If I was in Arizona, I'd still request iced tea
Bizarre don't give a shit about you
On top of the mountain - ain't nuttin' your bitch-ass crew can do
Sick MC that they call Peter
Treat your crew like an unexpected meter reader
Talkin' more shit than Howard Cosell
Butt-fuckin' jezebels in nasty hotels

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Proof]
How you think yo' crew sound compared to this?
It's the team that yo' entire clique is scared to diss
Demandin' attentions when the Glock sound
Y'all niggas to be murdered like Jeffrey Dahmer's on lock down
I'm Brown like Bobby, pullin' hoes like Whitney
Take your title, kill your moms- so you won't forget me
Lips sealed; nigga, I might blow important plots
Whoever front is gettin' done like Michael Jordan pops
Yo I'm number one translator, mic famed Dirty D
Y'all niggas gettin' hung like this was 1933
Got word of me- now flee, cause you ain't got a chance
Death is three easy steps, so now we gotta dance
So look away; don't play with the style master
I love killing' beef, so I kill a whole cow pasture
Lyrically, I'm sick ill, everything but sober
My nickel-plate, pack the disc-tray
Jack and fool get fucked over - BRING IT!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dirty Dozen is the clique so walk right over and lynch ya'
Rip the ass right out ya' pants like a Doberman Pinscher
Like the cobra and ninja, my intention's to injure
And prevent ya from enterin' from an inch of my center
Or get your motherfuckin' pants split at the creases
Fuckin' you intellectually
Givin' you mental sexually transmitted diseases
My duty is to keep a stranger barred
I guard my sector like a Saint Bernard and this ain't your yard
Bringin' the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger
Droppin' your whole clique with one finger 'til none linger
Beware of my dogs attackin' like a pack of Great Danes
Chargin' like freight trains through the great plains

[Hook x4]



It's a long year, pretending I belong here
One day, I plan to be a family man, happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'til I'm glad to be buried



Broke the rubber
Busted a nut up in your mother
So how you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker
Talking like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out of your track
I Smack her up and fuck her
Always talk shit high
Smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die
Just by walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfreaking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Jewelling at the way your jewellery sparkles
Head full of charcoals
Smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read
Disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes and smashing up cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms
Chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous
Liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits who carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off
Aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits



[Intro]
Ahh! You sick asshole let me go
Somebody please! Help!
Oh my God, please help me! Oh
"It fits perfect"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Better watch out, sucka, now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught coming and I'm packing in my lunch a
Bunch of missile launchers and a bunch of contra–
Band, van full of ganja, now come on, jump
Man, stop moshin' Marshall; oh my God, ya
Doing the cha-cha and the Cucaracha with a quadra–
Plegic, boogying down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan, lick it while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the Buddha'd do to me what it's done?
Such cynicism when there’s izm in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips, son
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo–pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks
"Mister – Help me" is what he said to me and then sunk
Women, skinning them and cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin, once

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place?
Hide 'em in the wall, well, how long will the drywall take?
Well, fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries, for the moment, I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in the back of my damn house, rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin
Vinn, on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you trying to fight? You will never win
Severin' legs, arms; damn, there goes another limb
Pull the lever then; trap door, death is evident

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin', so chill
Fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffin' those girls
Man, I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her, then I wait, I come back later
Just-a clutching those steel
Blades, baby, when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearing voices like
"Wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put ya shish kebab skewers into her
Barbecue her, would you do to her what you usually do
To a girl who's skin's newer?"
(In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
Boo-yah! Who ya think you're fucking with?
Duck, because here he comes again

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill



[Bugz]
Fuck that!
Who run shit once these drums hit?
You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip, for you to come get
Your clique made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas, is who you run wit
Making half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit!
You could make a double album, won't have one hit!
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad-mit, that my style is unfit
For momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
This egotistic hip-hop fundamentalistic
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bend shit
Smoke the blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Your bitch pay my bill, that's where the hell your rent went
Fuck that!



[Verse 1: 2Pac]
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggas die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Gettin' lost in the madness, blunted gettin' tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin', "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin' my clip, I'm watchin' every bullet spit when I kick 'em
Niggas die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggas that's caught
Had a motherfuckin' warrant but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon

[Hook: 2Pac]
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
But don't blame me, blame the [?]
Goin' to hell with my finger on the trigger
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces, and you Nazis
Watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed and you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' them go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to

[Hook: 2Pac]
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
But don't blame me
Nigga go in the hell with my finger on the trigger
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
So suck [?]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come and save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, thug nigga
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die



[Intro]
Yo, check it out
What's fucked up... is I don't see either one of us budging

[Verse 1]
"I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect"
That's what he says to himself
As he use his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
'Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

[Hook]
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep hounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks so you ain't taking out shit
And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

[Hook]
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
You must be taking too much (E...)

[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
And I'm not excluding myself 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if I really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gon' lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

[Hook]
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)

[Outro]
Get at me, dog
Holla



[Intro: 50 Cent, Eminem, Green Lantern]
Yeah
Shady (Ha-ha)
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (Ha-ha)
Here we go again
Yeah
The evil genius, Green Lantern

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say, "What up?", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, "Ja, what up, dawg?"
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Eminem]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Tony!


[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Eminem]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Lloyd Banks!

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out your van and (Break it, break it, break it down!)
They see me pop a boy icy 'cause I could
You been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (Hood)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us if half of your artists got make-up on?
Easy now, and you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' 'bout what pain is, sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, muh'fucker

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Eminem]
I know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, Shady Aftermath
G-Unit
Fuck you think they call us G-Unit for?
'Cause we move units, huh-uh
Don't think we ain't billin' you for this motherfuckin' studio time
Matter of fact, keep it on 50, we'll call it even, ha



[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Slim Shady (x3)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Well I do pop pills
I keep my tube socks filled
And pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed
Spit game to these hoes
Like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate
Girls, women, and bitches
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night
The stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport
Sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking [pregnant] bitch in her [stomach] with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out
I black out, I'm back out
I'm lookin for something of to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French
Then translate in English
Then I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy (Slim Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim motherfucking Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got an impulse
Gave to insult you with a pencil (Bitch)
And waste the paper on you
Chopping down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'

[Hook]

[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
Turn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll the Vega's
Me and Slim Shady on some shit daily
What you want, what you got
Is it hot, is it hot
Turn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors
We gonna get high, we gonna roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want, what you want
"A person from another planet might disagree with you."
"Well if you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth."

[Interlude]
Slim Shady, Misdemeanor
Timbaland
Slim Shady, Misdemeanor

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends
Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Spraying tecs at you until you see your fucking legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you
Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground
(Keep filming)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped 'em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
Imma get the East and West beefing again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy, get back
I'mma put you all in the line and I'mma watch you MC's die
Yo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind
I think somebody done pissed her off this time
I'mma have to bust you through your chest and
You gonna have to clean up the mess
It's raining, raining and it's pouring loud
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me dammit, bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile
Lay em on down, like they lived underground
For the sound that me and Timbaland, we found
Get your ass kicked later or get your ass kicked now

[Outro]
Uhh, one-two Misdemeanor, Slim Shady, Timbaland, motherfucker
Uhh uhh uhh, two, two, two, triple zero



[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile—let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)


[Verse 1: Eminem]
You're 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh, my Lord! Lower the casket down (Down!)
Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow! (Pow!)
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town (Town!)
Ground zero, Shapiro the king cash cow (Cow!)
Do I make 'em say "Wow!"? Strip! (Ow!)
Bow! I sit with the pound, Click, (Blow!) Blow!
Click, click, (Blow!) Click, (Blow!)
Stop traffic, dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches, I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start, when I growl
(Rawr, rawr, rawr!)
Let me come and mop up the knockoffs​
When I pop off and never stop, 'cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (Pause!)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough—
What—in the fat fishes of a phenomenal
Fahrvergnügen fuck—is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song
I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
And witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells
See these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales
And I shit on these males, till it's stinkin'
Fouler, than a weed smell,nigga, your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?
Talking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail
Until they cripple, see I cook, like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!) Oh, see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)
It’s kinda like, me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (What!?)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up, like boots
When I’m pushing they face in the mud—
(Ahgah!) Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
And gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!)
Shit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)
Your head up off your shoulders (With)
Bullets bigger, than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)
And the way it’s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)
See, me and Shady together; we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch
(We that sick!) like I come from Haiti
I’m suggesting you pay me, don’t make me wanna spaz
(Al-la-la!) Like I’m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)
While I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Now it’s mine, and I’m putting my feet up (Black!)
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long
Niggas is asking if the hook had died, nah
But the beat is fried!

[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Sample]
Yo
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on-)
("Yo, chill, man—chill!")
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying "He's bi!"
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, "Rape!"—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
"Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!", 'cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
"Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?"
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
"I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!"
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God; I'm the S.O.G
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog
Yes, yes, y’all (Wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So ("Jump around! Jump! Jump!")
Get that ass shaking ("Jump around! Jump!")
Came to hit you, with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and ("Jump!")
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success, than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale, I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

[Outro: Sample]
"Yo, chill, man—chill!"

Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him

In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible."
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid…

You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser
Shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage," what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!

If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business, once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', "Fuck safe sex!"
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
And it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel

But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, your puss
And thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track

Why am I such a dick?



Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible."
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laughin' stock
That was fuckin' stupid…

You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble 'causer, a double crosser
Shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage," what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!

If I was president
Gettin' off is the first order of business
Once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam

But as far as these lines I rap

Why am I such a dick?



[Verse]
I'm cancerous
So when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fucking legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
‘Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no!) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked
More than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?



[Intro]
(I, I wanna grow up too)
"Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
Here we go!

[Verse 1]
Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash."
"Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass."
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the "Mr
Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 2]
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: "Slim, you're really startin' to upset me."
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
"We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way."

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 3]
So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
"Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!" [whoosh]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
"What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri."
"Fuck it," keep goin', no time to waste
"Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case."
"Okay," fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
"Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!"
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
"He couldn't have fell off that hard." Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
[Four impacts] "What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys."
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
"Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!"
"Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!"
"Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!")
"Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch



[Intro]
"Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops."
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting. Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated--"
"On again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot."
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12"
"D12, back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold



[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we’re alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you’ll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be
Just thinking ahead, I’ma make it if it kills me
Let’s see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion (ha!)
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad’s crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into them, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad… shit, I don't know

[The sound of a bottle of pills being opened is heard. Eminem ingests them and collapses over the floor]



Yeah!
50 Cent, Lloyd Banks
Tony Yayo, G-Unit!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part in my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right (What?)
To send a motherfucker at you tonight (Uh-huh~!)
G-Unit!!

[Lloyd Banks]
And I ain't stoppin 'til my click poppin, swimmin in barrels of money
Ma can walk around with her head up cause her child ain't a dummy
It's funny - niggas'd rather see you sufferin and hungry
I'm comfy as hell, skatin with another nigga's money (WOO~!)
You lying your ass off; you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin your mask off, as soon as you act up (WHAT~!)
You know what I came for, a peace of the game or
Artillery that's 'bout as long as a chainsaw
I'm wide awake, but it still feels like I'm dreamin
40 cal' under my pillow condom feeling my semen
The physical presence of a female's the form of a demon
That's why I, fuck 'em and leave 'em get my nut while I'm breathin (YEAH~!)
Never thought they'd catch me slippin now I'm duckin and drippin
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you grippin
You trippin, no record can get my ass in position
Death waits for no religon whether catholic or christian
Listen; I went through momma bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause as poppa was in and out the prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect the odds
We got more four-fives and 9's then a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)
Niggas hatin when you do good, but when you broke
Your friends and your enemies they love you (they love you)
Chi-Chi, get the llello (get the llello)
Picture me bein cracked, out of town trips on the train - WHAT~?!
Chi-Chi, get the Yayo
Picture me bein cracked... (TONY YA-YO!!!) here we go
You can sniff me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin country
Wall Street niggas, they cop me on a low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on a bus, the train, a plane
I'm smuggle, I'm nuttin but trouble
I'll make your money double, cook me in bakin soda
I'll turn your who-rock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill ya 'fridgerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
You can put me in the door panels or your stash box
Put me in your Nikes, Timbs and Reeboks
If you copped three and a half, you hustlin backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin forwards (what?)
I'm tryin to move more birds, in P.A. all day
On the corner of 3rd - nigga what?!

[50 cent)
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (WHAT?!)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)

Picture me polishin pistols, I'm comin to get you, the shells hit you
You scream, think I'm playin - I mean it
Man I done brought all these pistols, let's get it poppin
Start to wavin my embroidered shell casings get to droppin
The devil's 'round the corner I got to much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket, just stunt and I'll pop it
I'm dyin to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you numbered for death
As the world turns, the lessons should be learned
Count all my blessings, clean up my weapons, I'm ready for war
The strong survive, the weak shall perish, I told you before
Hoes they compliment me now like 50 - nice chain!
Belagio, twenty grand of chips at the dice game
Ballin out, can't stop it, you gotta watch MTV
BET, nigga you see me~!!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin good
Or cause niggas feel me, more than you in yo' hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin and you don't bust your gat
You pussy!!

Yeah explain it to the niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin front nigga
Talk all that gangsta shit on the record; I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga; ask around in my hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talk about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
You pussy... get it poppin!

{NON-STOP... can't forget... Shady, Aftermath!}



[Intro: Gil Scott-Heron]
You will not be able to stay home, brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

[Chorus: King Green]
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

[Post-Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggas my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinatin'
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns, and here's my battle cry

[Pre-Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Ring the alarm, the caterpillar is firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

[Chorus: King Green]
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do? Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to a regret or two
I do what I wanna do, they do what I let them do
Everything these niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie
It's nothing I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin' the butterfly
Don't you ever disrespect the fuckin' caterpillar

[Chorus: King Green]
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
You're looking at Attila, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill
A savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You're havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'
Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half
And then had the shit hangin' by a flap of skin
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot
You copy me, but you're not
You can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall
Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
'Till the shingles come off the roof we'll shout at the ceiling
Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot
A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart
The frauds from the cream of the crop
(Wait a minute) Hold up like a flashcard
Damn dawg, is that copyin' or payin' homage?
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re-hatch on you
Come back as a black wasp, half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it
Smash it and stand on it, dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's a manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song
And can't hold a candle but even Daniel-san whacks off
You jack-offs need to come to grips like a hand job
The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number twos
'Cause that's all I dos with 'em, poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin' a deuce
And when I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em
Bitch, shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon
Then I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb
Then I'm flushin' you!



[Verse: Eminem]
There are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar
And have it overflowing
So don't get me going: don't dare start
You'll never see me again: Amelia Earhart
I'm popping a wheelie, off to a really unfair start
I'm past grinding, for me– guess I just be grounded up
Like Ground Round or a pound of chuck
Tightly-wound as fuck 'till the Fire Marshalls come shut
Fire Marshall, down and up
I suggest you better shut the fuck up
And stop fucking around and duck!
I ain't playing this time, I told you I'm out for blood
So to say "I keep it 100" would probably sound redundant
Like calling a bitch a ho or asking a gal to suck
And blow on your dick cock
Is she up to screwing? Down to fuck?
It's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut
With a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled
Running through a house of mutts
In other words, I'm shutting every one of you bitches' mouths up
And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt!
And ain't shit changed, my shit still don't stink, player
My farts may have gotten staler ever since
I became a trailer park celebrity
Maybe my complexion became a little paler
Poster child for white trash
I'm a Garbage Pail Kid sailor, yeah
See me I'm all up on your bitch means I'mma rape her
All I got for these hoes is dick, duct tape and a stapler
So bitch, you better look for table scraps to scrape up
I don't subscribe to the News or the Free Press
But homie, I get the paper!



[Verse 1 - Lloyd Banks]
I just touched down - Ferrari-to-concrete
I ain’t even home when they’re talking about me
Fuck out my ear if you talking about "free"
Nigga, free don't pay the bills
I'm ballin all-out, B
These rappers don't know me
Nah, I ain’t your homey
If your name ain't Em, Ferrari or Tony
I like my wheel chromey
My Bentley, my Rolly
My Magnum, my phonie
South Jamaica shawty
These slugs I took in the gut, yo
The work's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow
Clear my mind and whipping the truck low
You’re looking for trouble
I pop death
You’re looking to a sun dawg
If rap ain't work, I be pimpin' on some ho
Still eating lobster and shrimp in the Bungalow
I'm back like crack over the drum roll
You know - wherever I go the gun go

[Hook - Akon]
We on the grind
All the time
Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a nine
To see the shine
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper

Cause I’m a celebrity
Ghetto-celebrity
Ain't nothing changed nigga

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
The media will test ya, popularity is pressure
Porche Panamera platinum, hammer through the metal
Wreck a booth up, I'm too tough
That inner-city grammar, step your jewels up
They bruised up, I'll sparkle for the camera
Harsh reality's what pulls them
And holding them back from opening
Verbal attack all over these niggas
Push the herd to the back
I'm the kind that they prey on
Spending half of they day on
Lay on niggas for days, the shots spray on
My sound system knock and it pound 2Pac
6 4 jumping like the ground too hot
They spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks
Two shots in the air for niggas that ain't here
Two tone, two door, grey top, blue floor
Green guap galore, in and out of new hall
That bright light you saw was a paparazzi flash
I’m tryna snap a picture through your Maserati glass

[Hook - Akon]
We on the grind
All the time
Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a nine
To see the shine
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper

Cause I’m a celebrity
Ghetto-celebrity
Ain't nothing changed nigga

[verse 3: Eminem]

...fucking stupid



[Intro: Kon Artis]
Yeah, we straight from the census bureau
Haha, Runyan Ave
We lookin for yo' momma
D-12 - where yo' momma at?
Miko - where yo' momma at?
Young Zee, hey Dame - where yo' momma at?
I wanna fuck that bitch, her stankin ass
Hey Em where yo' momma at? (Ohhhh-ohhhhh)
Yo..

[Kon Artis]
You know me, Denaun the same ol' nigga
I spray paint your car up like Rain-O nigga
See me and you are sorta like the same I guess
We both rock mics but yours is into our chest
You can't do nuttin to me, Runyan Ave's unruly
And truly this ain't a movie, you get slapped with the tooly
So pass the slimmy and the Hennessy, I got the energy
To steal every car in this vicinity, you feelin me?
Take it back to when Das EFX was sayin niggity-wiggity-wild
Piggity-pow, nigga be out
You don't really want war, I'm chillin at your door
This uzi will have you bloody windmill-ing on the floor
I can't be a punk, my daddy wasn't none
I lose a fight after school and I came home and got one
You reap what you sew, that shit you oughta know
I keep it on the flo' under the seat - I ain't a ho!

[Hook: Kuniva] + (Kon Artis)
You know it's been a while but we feelin it now
(The rough sound muh'fucker, niggas killin it now)
Goddamn! You don't want no problems B
(Get your name in the obituary column sheet)
It's that same ol' shit, niggas back again
(Yo yo, you fallin off, goin back to smokin crack again)
Hit the weed (guzzle your Corona) pass the Gin
(Better duck cause they back bustin gats again)

[Swifty]
A basket case indeed; stronger than a can of mace
Slap you in the face while you patty-cakin witcha seed
I'll be makin all these niggas wanna take a beam
And put it right on my head
You don't be takin heed, you probably idol the Feds
Havin meetings to recite what I said
Liable to have you in a medical room
Walk in that bitch with a cell phone then turn it on
"You fittin to die holmes!" {*explosion*}
Got a chrome that be fuckin up shit worse than I
You would swear that I'm a Gemini
I kill a guy for nothin - eye to eye
And I ain't gotta touch them niggas face soon as I say somethin
Got a pump that'll tear your arm quick, when I leave a carcass
You would think you in Death Row's office (AHH!) {*gun clicks*}
(Hang a nigga!) I'm ill enough to fall in the middle of moshpits
Survive and I'm gettin up high without a flaw bitch!

[Hook]

[Proof]
I'm a dog on the mic that'll brawl out with Christ
Get to cappin at your captain 'til he fall outta life
I'm all outta nice, nigga tuck your chain
Put holes in your head and finger-fuck your brain
Fool fuck this game, I'm poppin at coach
Momma dropped me on my head and knew that somethin was broke
I ain't feelin nothin you wrote so I'm stompin your throat
Show up at the hospital and start punchin your folks
I'm a uzi with arms and legs
Duty calm your man, before my tooly bomb his head (WHAT!)
You wanna take what my 40-cal since you bitch-made
Spittin the right game so yo' ass can get laid
The fuck down, I don't give a fuck now, whassup?
Talkin bout "Clappin" - quit actin, you barely bust nuts
Don't get it twisted at the gates, the name is Proof
And I'mma kill every man that came with you

[Bizarre]
Yeah, yeah - KNOCK KNOCK! Guess who showed up?
44-mag and tear your whole door up
Pink shower cap and, yellow drawers
My dick's so small, I can pee on my own balls (hahaha)
When it comes to pussy, Bizarre goes to work
That's why my mouth smell like hot dogs and yellow Persh (eww!)
So tell your momma hit me on my cell phone
I ain't home, I'm so wet gettin stoned with Norah Jones

[Hook]

[Kuniva]
Yo, I chuck niggas daily, a six-man crew that's born crazy
A triple O.G. like Tray Deee (whattup Loc?)
I stay sparkin, bitch I got a attitude
I step on your shoes and won't say pardon - be cautious!
Hidin from the one-time, nutty as I wanna be
Wild and disorderly, pissin on your toilet seat
Nigga now you know it's me, I got a .44 wit me
Bitches all over me, +Sayin Yes+ like Floetry
Homie you wanna be a G? Go toe-to-toe wit me
It ain't no ho in me dawg, I shoot out where your colons be
Wave the people-mover, crowd-controller
Rob niggas 'til my pockets look greener than Yoda
And you know that I'm the +Shady+ type, the crazy type
That's probably why promoters never pay me right
We a bunch of hooligans, my hands is on the tool again
I'm bout to bust a Huey and spray up a fuckin school again

[Hook]

[Outro: Bizarre]
Yeah.. D-12
Devil's Night.. part two..
The drama.. continues..
KaySlay.. hahahaha..



...



[Proof]
Pah pow!
Straight off the coral
Now the Dirtiest street vet from the Mile
Incest without the Texas six-shooter
Body-bullet polluter
Perverted intruder
Now who the fuck wanna buck with the disease
That's diss eased
I got a bitch named trigger
My main squeeze will make your brain freeze
Dirty D. is dope like cane trees

[Eye-Kyu]
Remain eased
Maintain chill status with no pause
Hug slugs hit your cabbage
And turn your dome to coleslaw
My only thought of survival before my arrival
I'm jumpin' out on niggas like I'm 5-0
Smack 'em up like a pack o' trifle and fly hoes
Any opportunity to mangle I never pass up
Fuckin' your clique with broomsticks
Face down ass up
Dirty Dozen packin' the shit
To turn your chest red
With that dick in your mouth, fuckin' everything you just said

[Eminem]
Yeah yeah bitch
Comin' to a block near you is Dirty Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with 30 husbands
When I was five I was already fuckin'
And playin' X-Rated cassettes
With Teddy Ruxpin
I used to walk up and down the block cussin'
Locked in youth homes at 6 for Glock bustin'
I grew up with knot ballers who got dollars
Shot callers with guns and rottweilers

[Bizarre]
By any means necessary I'm on a killing spree
It's the devil in me
Intoxicated with wild Hennessy
Beware life ain't fair and I don't care
Cher braids my hair while her kids are in day care
Two blunts and I'm out for lunch
You're worse than I'm a sugar pie honey bunch
Diss Bizarre Kid, that ain't the answer
You're more uncomfortable than an anorexic cat with fuckin' cancer

[Hook] (4x)
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants

[Bizarre]
Locked in the studio boy
I don't wanna mingle
Smokin' LSD workin' on Lou Roff's new single
Who's the big guy that's quick like Sugar Ray
Fuck Calgon bitch
Bizarre might take you away
Give up the pussy, 'cuz I know youz a freak
Replacin' your hamster in a week
Cuz my crew's gots to eat
Date rapin' anorexic girls in my beat up car

[Bugz]
(Hold up, Bizarre!  You're takin' that shit too far!)

[Bizarre]
But I can't stop cuz my will ain't there...

[Eminem]
Bust a nut and dump that bitch in Lake St. Clair
Your mistakes ain't rare
Your rap style annoys
You rhyme like a bitch, plus I can't stand your voice
Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck
Eat a dick, you need a brick upside your dome
We be the clique runnin' you down in carloads
Leavin' you smashed on tar roads
Flat line like bar codes

[Eye-Kyu]
Put up your guard hoes
I'm blazing heat the way we speak
Not even Nike could cover these amazing feats
Burning rappers eternally
Internally and externally
For half steppin' like one-legged fraternities
Quick draw McGraw
B.K.A. Eye-kyu
Puttin' something inside you
Leavin' holes that I see right through
For anyone obstructing my view
My order of attack
These slugs to your chest that'll blow your heart out your back
Makin' sure you get fed with a whole lot of lead
Then throw you off of the Ambassador Bridge
And scream "DROP DEAD"

[Proof]
Largely I'm out to stack equations
Without a tax evasion
With mossy that's amazin'
All the same like black and asian
My pack evasion attack a stage and roll plush like a Cadillac
I wish your fleet would try to battle rap
Would make a man bleed
Like a cattle pack stampede
Frontin' cosign my hands bleed
Think they recognize like Sam Sneed
My drug ain't dispose ya
Fold ya couldn't (*BLAM*)
Another classic closure
The death master out to blast ya
My team run shit from the deep East Side
Down to Lasher, past the - norm
My group swarm
Molest the children of the corn
Dirty D til infinity now bring it on

[Hook (4x) + Outro]
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants (Bitch!)
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
You motherfuckers can die
Aiiyo, I shake the world... yes yes, yes yes



[Obie Trice - talking]
A lot of motherfuckers man
Lou Green, Shyne Stringer, Keith Stringer
Lawon, Goo Serve, Little Randy
That's what I'm doin this for (EW YEAH!)

Yeah, we ain't here to mourn
We here to celebrate
So this one is for all my dogs that didn't make it in the struggle man
(EW YEAH!)

[Verse 1]
I's remember when I was on the Ave. clutchin them dimes
Gun touchin' my spine, bustin' my rhymes
Feelin like I'm livin in them lost times
No sight of the future, damn right I shoot ya (ew yeah)
Palm tight on the Rooster
Old in the face, cause this hold on my case
Got my growth at a fast pace
Old folks like "O, oh he's a bad case
He won't last, his track record'll do the math"
Crack solicitation on the Avenue is not new to your listeners
But this is true, listen up
I gotta spew it and keep it all truth or else
I might as well give this up, feel me now
From rocks to pow pows, Glocks to pow-der
I done did it all, so I clutch my balls
And notice they still here, so Obie is still here
So Kobe here's to you and daddy's new career

[Hook] - w/ ad libs
So grab your cups of beer
Put 'em up let's cheer
Here's a toast to all my soldiers who ain't here
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (ew yeah)

Now grab your cups of gin
Put 'em up let's win
Here's a toast to never lookin back again
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (ew yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now I understand every man got a story to tell
But fuck it, I got a story as well
Growin up where us niggas either buried or jail
Popped by "Dirty Harry" or popped by the cops for they yayo, locked in a cell
Who's to blame when I was raised in this hood, where my crew was slain
Only a few remains, y'all talk about struggle
With your bubblegum lifestyle (*scratching*) nigga fuck you
I'm here today for fam passed away
Bodies deep six nigga, flesh decay
Real cats who had techs to spray
Babies to raise, miss them cradles went straight to the grave
The hood life is in me
So I sip the Remy, while my pockets scream "give me"
Lend me your ear, I'm guaranteein y'all feelin me
Straight from the block to the industry (C'MON)

[Hook]

[Obie Trice - talking]
Yeah, all my homies that's deceased rest in peace
My nigga KF Ski, Little Green
P-Funk you'll be home in a minute nigga, haha, we get it poppin
We got a chance to speak to the world nigga, haha, and I ain't stoppin
Straight off the craft .. 313

(EW YEAH!)



[Intro: Eminem]
You are now listening to the sounds of Shady
And Alchemist
Alchemist
Alchemist

[Verse: Eminem]
Got an axe in the duffel bag
Couple of fags stuffed in the backseat
Muzzled and gagged, wrapped in bubble wrap
Two lesbians, a couple Hustler mags
Now grab the Pez dispenser
Fill it up to the max with muscle relaxers
The governor of Alaska, she lusts when I ask her
To shove my Pulaski sausage up in her ass, huh
While we hover over Nebraska
Shootin' at the fuckin' buffalo pasture
In the helicopter, man, I can't fuck her no faster
She's screamin' "Grab my titties, Shady, suck on those bastards"
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a gigolo, bitch, I look like the Juggalo rapper?
Every day, man, I just seem to get a little bit doper
Shit, back down? Man, I'd rather lick on a scrotum
And eat the fuckin' Octomom's pussy lips with some okra
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissor with Oprah
While Rosie pussy-farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get a boner and play dick swords with the Jonas Brothers
Your motherfuckin' mother's aroma's like no other
I keep thinkin' of her smothered in somas

[Hook: Eminem]
It's chemical warfare, drop bombs like Saddam
I'm bringing the drama, like Barack Obama
Playing Rock Em' Sock Em' robots with the Octomama
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas
For chemical warfare

[Outro: Eminem]
Did I just say Octomom twice in the same rap?
Fucking wack
Chemical warfare
Chemical warfare



Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off! My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!" Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, uh (Haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (Woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (Woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause…

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (Bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like—

[Chorus: PHresher]
—throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew



[Intro: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Take 'em to church, I'm talkin' the tabernacle
It's the return of the body snatcher
Walk in the spot, make my woman smack ya (whoo!)
In a fruit fight, I aim at your Adam's apple
Pull up in the candy car, eatin' a candy bar
And my girl eatin' a candy apple
Yeah (mm), I line their ass up (up)
I aim at their goozer (baow!)
All of these stones on my neck, uh
They must have looked at Medusa
Pockets Rasputia of course
I drove some rims to court
I fucked some twins before
I had a Benz before, this is the sin report
This is the murder, murder, pass the burner, Em (uh)
Your money shorter than an acronym (ayy)
Big body when I'm backin' in (whoo!)
Ladi-dadi, got a bunch of bodies
Niggas fakin', niggas human traffickin' (whoo!)
I'm on the Act' again, uh
This ain't a accident, uh
King like Ak-Ron
I run the trap again, you on the treadmill (treadmill)
Never Neverland, shit came with a Ferris wheel (goddamn!)
Ferris day off, baby, AR in the same car
Most of y'all my sons, aww, look at little JR
F12 same color Kate Moss
Uh, I'm talkin' wristin' the pot
I'm talkin' this and you not
I'm talkin' bricks and you not
I'm talkin' straight up and down, nigga, like 6 o'clock
This is the equinox, this what the people want
Somebody at the door, I heard the speaker knock, uh

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Verse 2: PHresher]
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
These bitches got flavors
They all wanna smoke but ain't doin' no labor
But they shoppin' at Raleys, they stingin' like tasers
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
They fly on the latest
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor
We eatin' that chicken, lobster, potatoes
You must be sniffin' that yayo
If you don't think I'm that nigga
Swagger on ten since a day old
It's a-okay though, whippin' up whip like it's mayo
Every track is a K.O., technical K.O. 
Go off your head like I'm Ayo
Out of this world, talkin' NATO
It's 'cause of jail, ho, don't be an A-hole
'Cause I got shooters that shoot when I say so (lay low!)
Wanna be in my shoes, you ain't paid no dues
Real nigga, you ain't break no rules (hell yeah!)
High school, niggas ate yo' food
Might dumb it down a little, but I ain't no fool (hell yeah!)
Niggas hate every day, B (yeah)
Shit is O.C. lately (yeah)
Gotta break 'em off with these Dre beats (yeah)
Or I might go crazy (hell yeah!)
These niggas too goddamn lazy (too lazy)
Don't ever, ever, ever try to play me (to play me)
Lil' shawty now comin' from BK (BK)
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z (like JAY-Z)
Nothin' but love for my idols (love for my idols)
I feel entitled to titles (to titles)
Fuck it, man, I want the title (I want the title)
Submission, they goin' all viral

[Chorus: PHresher]
Like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (hell yeah)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bin Laden with a pen, bodyin' again
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi in the Taliban plotting an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I would not even relent
Up on a little like Osama with a bomb under the bin
And down the middle of the Pentagon
And hit a kindergartener with a rental (stop!)
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
"Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore?" (huh?)
"Why you always gotta smack a whore?" (huh?)
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (huh?)
Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, “'Walk On Water' sucks”
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it
So you formed your verdict
While you sat with your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (chill!)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (wait, Em!)
But nowadays, every flow, every cadence sound the same (skrrt)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why I write 'til the page is outta space
Yeah, from 7 Mile in Novara
To "How can I be down?", all of us tryna pile in the car (yeah!)
We shot for the stars (yeah!)
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (yeah!)
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (yeah!)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (woo!)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
And I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the fuck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
"Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at?
What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyoncé this and Kehlani that" (yeah!)
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
To the body bag, I'll be back
And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like—

[Outro: PHresher]
Like Chloraseptic



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
(Amen, Amen)
Yeah! Ha ha, feels good
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get a second chance
But I ain't blowin' this one
Nah, man, ha ha
Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

[Bridge: Eminem]
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand
Take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock
Take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down when I was down, I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick!
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses
'Cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up
Stand behind you like "Whooo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See, you can hate him, he don't blame you
Frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

[Refrain: Eminem]
Now guess who? (Hey!) Here's a clue (Hey!)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, (Hey!), he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?

[Chorus: Kobe]
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella Man
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Music is my time machine, so call me
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Bridge 2: Eminem]
Fuck catchin' lightning, he struck it
Screamed "Shut up!" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down
And made it rain upward
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Rewound the future to the present
Paused it – don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka
He's the shit right now, he's
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old
Can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new
Que será, consider it his last hurrah
The coup de grâce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient, I
Will make no more mistakes, shit, my
Potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed—yeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit, I ain't even suppose to be here by the grace of God
The skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm the spittin' image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists

[Refrain: Eminem]
Who? Here's a clue (Hey!)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, (Hey!), he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
(Hey!) Now, (Hey!) what's his name?

[Chorus: Kobe]
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Music is my time machine, so call me
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah! Come on! Come on!
ATL! Yeah! Haha! WOO!
If you feel like you've been touched
By our music that is

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nowadays everybody just wanna poke their nose in our business
What is this some kinda joke?
Man, everywhere I go all I’m hearing is more talk
"What’s up with Jada and Fat Joe?
Doing a song with ol’ boy on a song “New York”
Man, I thought you just did a song with them both?”
Man, the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass revoked
I never had no ghetto pass, you asshole
You really wanna know, when I did live in the ghetto
I kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
So I suggest you get your facts straight before you go
This assuming to know
I ain't grow up in no trailer park just cause I was poor
Man, this is my testimo...ny to those that don’t know
Me, and feel like they do
If not to feel compelled to go and speak on me too
So this dick goes to YOU and this dick goes to YOU
And if you feel like you want it then you can get it too
And when your through pass it to the person next to you
Ayo, Stat get on the mic and come and spit a few

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Motherfucker's so quick, to spit bullshit
Stat Quo, who’s this, Em gave me the assist
Shorty got a full clip, standing in the pulpit
A–Town misfit, repping that south shit
Back four or some years ago, foe was hating, I hear them
My flow is skating across the track, rollerblading
Losing patience, want to get on chasing but this taking all my energy
Tired of waiting, people faking fronting like they kin to me
When they're really enemies, give a fuck what it is
Cuz, this what it gonna be, Shady/Aftermath lately
GMM, baby, young nigga out them projects Thomasville
Grady hospital, Freida’s only baby
Niggas biting my style get rabies
Fuck you, pay me, eat a cock, swallow shit
And plus you ain't fucking with this, so don’t trip, ha ha
Them little boys see it, what an incredible twist
I write incredible script
That fit in with the plot it’s endless
Now testify to this
Let it bang when you hear, this is classic shit



[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have—I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely, and Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral!
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet







[Intro]
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
What up? What up? What up? Get down tonight
Outsidaz. Get down tonight
Outsidaz. Get down tonight
[?] Young D. Get down tonight
[?]

[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
No, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
‘Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a bitch herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my EP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this!

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 2]
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
‘Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin' "I suck!"
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud: "All y'all get the hell out now!"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
"But Eminem, this is your record release party!"
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 3]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
‘Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D, they was like, "Gee
I don't know, he might be!"
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster." (okay, bye)
Peace out, then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (bring)
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)



[Intro: Skylar Grey]
And the wheels go around and 'round, and 'round

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
If you got a sweet tooth, you can taste my watermelons
If the swingset bores you, I can show you all my talents
I can wear a tan like other bitches can't
You can have all this, boy and there’s only one thing that I want from you

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last like other bitches can’t
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you, hey

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
I’m only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it’s true
I’m not like the sluts in this town
They make me blech in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
‘Cause you’re the boy that I like
It’s like I’m a sellout for you
But your bike’s so shiny and new (Shiny and new)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
She’s distracted, by my reflectors
Man, I can tell this chick’s attracted
My wheels spoke to her, my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging’s something I'm a pro at, but I ain’t practicing shit
Allen Iverson of safe sex
Condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy is to have you land where the kickstand is
Got this bitch gaggin’, they call me the broad killer
I’m the cousin of Godzilla
‘Cause I spit fire and my dick’s draggin', zig-zaggin' up the avenue
Pullin’ these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screamin’

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike
You want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike, ha ha



[Intro: Eminem & (Jazmine Sullivan)]
Yeah. (Oh)
This game is like cocaine. (I want this more than anything in the world)
Haha... So do I... at least I thought I did
(Got to have it, yeah I need it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading fading)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
It starts off something like, "Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?"
Now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
Wifebeaters and white t-shirts, Hanes mainly
It's a long shot, but is it possible? There's a lane, maybe
If not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name, fainting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his Plain Jane lady
And his baby Hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
He's ahead of the race, while maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that C-O-C-A-I-N-E?
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You’re operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts, people are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grilling ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya but you can’t decipher
Why for the life of ya, it wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again, she found Vicodin
In your pants last night again, your dispute's public
Nothing is private anymore, oh, and your best friend?
Say bye-bye to him, what kind of apple you take a bite of Slim?
(But this is what you wanted Marshall, ain't it?) Fuck no!
The way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that I painted
In my head, sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
Than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this world is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
Sniff 'til I fucking hurl, tell 'em all to fucking sit
And spin 'til they fucking twirl, middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then, now

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
You start off bright, just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite and lose your sight, they call this (fame)
You think you're good, just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough, no longer poor
But you lost your soul, they call it (fame)
I hear it callin', my name is callin'
Why you struggling when you could be ballin'?
My head is saying yes but my feet is stallin'
So many walkin' by the end they fallin'
But I gots to have it, like Eve and the apple
She had to grab it, I got to take it, I got to make it
That's the plan and I can't forsake it, yeah

[Hook]



(grunting)
(ringing tone)
Oh, answer the phone you fucking slut transvestite
With a cock, you're a man, aren't you?
You're a fucking man
(Hello?) Oh, hey
Um, is this, uh, I'm looking for a sensual, I don't know
Bodyrub, or something (Uh-huh, that's what I do)
Listen, what type of bodyrubs, like
I'm looking for like, um, I don't know, like
A cock massage... You know what I mean? (Right)
Like something like, I'm kind of, like
I don't know, I'm sure you do this everyday
Um... I'm just- I don't know, I'm looking for something like
My wife, my wi- I'm married, um
My wife does not satisfy me the way that you could



[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Slaughterhouse! Bus-a-Bus!
Somebody better hurry up and find the nearest fucking exit!
Joe Budden, come on!

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Barge our way through, they wouldn't open the door
First time high, they couldn't know it was raw
You would die if you smoked it, too potent to snort
If you think by the bar, you probably choke on the thought
What up, what up, what up? Speed dial a coroner
Done with subliminals, now I'm talking to all of ya
Try my patience, wearing it thin
I put my prints in your heart without piercing the skin
What up, what up, what up? I only need knuckles
Tell him to travel safe, then make his knees buckle
Before they love you, they gotta hate you
They say that real recognize real dog, you can spot fake too

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all know what it is, cause we do it often
Caught another body, buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin
We burn shit down, blow torch scorching
Slaughterhouse bitch, buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Knick-knack, paddy whack, Yaowa wanna bone
Click-clack, acrobatic coward with the chrome
Purchase another casket, I'm murdering ya bastards
My Desert Eagle's a bird, dirty little rachet
Lose a part of ya when the hollow one touch ya
Screaming "Oh ahh," when I Bus-a-Bus ya
I dress my baby up, she got a custom muffler
She be like "pew-pew" you be like "uh, uh, uh"
Can you lean with it? Can you drop with it?
Next time I tell you shoo, put a sock in it
What up, what up, what up? Act calm chief
We Sasquatch beef, big foot up your butt, shut up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
The most beautifulest thing in this world
Are the funerals I bring to this world
What up, what up, what up? Give me the beat, I'mma body it
John Gotti it, Crooked probably bodied the audience
What up, what up, what up? Then I'm tryna find a whore
Dig in that vagina like I'm mining for diamonds or
I'm tryna find China or some kind of dinosaur
Try to score like Kentucky in the final four
Yeah, you niggas still wussies
My gun is my other dick, cause it kill pussies
I'm hood, you good? I'm just checking homie
Still hammer dancing, two stepping with my weapon on...me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
I said if I ain't fucking with you, you can suck a short for Richard
Until you hiccup, hiccup, need I say...more?
Listening to a free beat by Dre in some free Beats by Dre...or
Tell my attorney to cook it and eat it, I play catch with the body
Of Bernie from Weekend at Bernie's with Crooked this evening
I'm up in y'all spot with Jersey Joe Walcott
And Brooklyn Ortiz, just please give us a reason
What up, what up, what up? Fuck all the singing
I'm about to be a rich nigga and waste the whole last bar screaming
You ready? AAAAHHHH

[Hook]

[Outro: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, what's up world?
Ha-ha, we here
You ready? AAAAHHHH



[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro]
'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some want a bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game, whoa
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck 'em all
Tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

[Ad-Libs]
God damn!
Is it that time again already?
Haha, okay
Y'all don’t look too happy to see me
Fuck, man
Don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right
Fuck y’all then!

[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog—fall back, you mutts!
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it, a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance, while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the Buddha, light a bong, but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song—come on!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Motherfucker, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You musta mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, "Shady ease up!
Man, chill!" Nah, I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During a earthquake, urine in your face
'Cause you're fake (*lightning noise*)  Ow! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
(*Lightning noise*) Ow! What the fuck? I just got struck by lightnin'
Alright then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
"This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you"
And just then the wind blew, and I said...

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
"So long," 'til then, I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
"Oh, bitches don't like that," homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-Tune
The last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, "I was writing this and I thought of you," so

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Outro]
I don't know, I don't know what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me



[Intro]
{*Gunshots*}
50 Cent, Shady, Aftermath
The Dream team
We gotta get the get well cards
Niggas is sick
Feel this {*gunshots*}
Motion picture shit
Hahaha!

[Verse]
Now don't think I won't hit you cause I'm popular
I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya
Catch you slipping I'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya
You never had a hot gun on ya waist and blood on your shoe
'Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
Homie, you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me
And I'm not like you
I'm like an animal with it, when I spit it, it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas trying to play me
One shot is not enough you need at least a Uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom, the kid start to feeling woozy
I write my life
You write what you see in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga, you can't move me
I find my space at the top
I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spit shells through your convertible Lotus you notice
Rich or poor, hollows still go through your door
This is war
You scared of me, you not prepared for me, the kid is back
50 Cent, I know you like that
Yeah, I know you like that
Green Lantern, Shady Records, Anger Management Tour
Homie, homie, homie... YEAH!



[Verse 1]
I'm no good for you
I'm not what you need
You've made that very clear
Though I disagree

[Pre-Chorus]
Enough to let you go
To let you drift away
Cause once you navigate these troubled waters
I believe that someday you'll return

[Chorus]
And I will still be here
When you come up for air
Do you what you gotta do
I'll wait for you, to come up for air

[Verse 2]
Cause in this whole wide world
There's no one else for me
So while you search the seas for answers
I will still be waiting

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Be sure to dive down deep
Because if you do
Even if it takes a thousand lifetimes
My love, I know you're finally gonna see the truth
And you'll return

[Chorus]
And I will still be here
When you come up for air
Do you what you gotta do
I'll wait for you, to come up for air

[Bridge]
And even if this really is the end
I'm sure I'll be alone until I'm dead
Cause no one else will ever quite compare
To them it wouldn't be fair

To lay here with somebody new
And all I did was think of you
If you're my Jack, then I'm your Rose
And I promise I will never ever let go

[Chorus]
And I will still be here
When you come up for air
Do you what you gotta do
I'll wait for you, to come up for air

[Outro]
To come up for air
Come up for air
Come up for air
To come up for air

To come up for air
Come up for air
Come up for air
To come up for air



I wasn't born mean I was pushed to treachery
I walked the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I like a veggie brain, turn to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the MC
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg, made outta wood? I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dike on the mic, I'm kinda like
Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes

Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash, bumping Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn near﻿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash, hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge, into on coming traffic
Caused a massive 42 car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard, you can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdraw
Dick's so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man, with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic Sports



[Eminem]
In my mind I'ma fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is Destiny, yes money I'm of running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

[Hook - 2Pac]
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed
My firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed
And fuck the world til I'm gone, Constantly armed
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed
My firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed
And fuck the world til I'm gone Bitches be warned

[Eminem 2x]
I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

[2Pac]
Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin to kill me
Picturin pistols, spittin hollow points til they drill me
Keepin it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin steel
See niggas is false, sittin in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin to be strong, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til I'm gone, Bitches be warned
Word is bonb, you'll get torn
I'm bustin on Guiliani, he rubbin my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do', with fo

[Hook]



[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
To sit on your lazy butt, and watch all the TV you ever wanted
Until your brain turned to mush, would you go for it
Or just let it slip
Yo

[Verse 1]
Remote is ready, eyes wide, palms are sweaty
There's Flintstones on the TV already, Wilma and Betty
No virgin to channel surfin', and I'm HD ready
So I flip, garbage is all I'm getting
There's Simon Cowell, who folks wanna disembowel
He opens his mouth, always says something foul
They're dying wow, wannabes are crying now
He votes 'em out, time to throw in the towel
Shows based on reality, oh the humanity
Oh, Ozzy's family sho' loves profanity
Woah the insanity, oh dogs that crap and pee
Home of depravity, no they live happily
Yo, plus Da Ali G Show, and Celebrity Mole
Oh there's Anna Nicole, she's scarin' me
Look, Ma — No cavities! Oh, it's a station break
Better go out to the kitchen and microwave something

[Hook]
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, they'd scold me, but I'd still tune into every show
My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Travel Channel, Discovery and Lifetime
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, cajoled me, "Turn off those music videos!"
I'm gonna watch C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The History Channel, and QVC, and Lifetime
You're gonna...

[Verse 2]
My butt is aching, as I watch NASCAR racing
That show about undertaking, Larry King
To 24, to Law & Order
The Weather Channel's boring like 60 Minutes
Ancient reporters, next up on E! True Hollywood Story
The rise and decline of twelve actors named Corey
Shows for next fall, they've already been namin'
CSI: Boise, and Touched by an Uncle
Both sound pretty lame, and
So does Everybody Tolerates Raymond
And King of Queens jumped the shark the first minute
I can't believe Richard Simmons ain't in it
I move right on to 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter
Then I bet I watch The Bachelorette
Followed by Welcome Back, Kotter
And The Muppet Show where they go "Mahna Mahna"

[Hook]
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, they'd scold me, but I'd still tune into every show (oh)
My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Disney Channel and A&E and Lifetime
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, cajoled me, but I still love Lisa Kudrow (oh)
I'm lookin at C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Playboy Channel, and Court TV, and Lifetime
You're gonna...

[Verse 3]
Never miss Melrose Place or Lost in Space
I've seen each Amazing Race and Without a Trace
But I only watched Will & Grace, one time, one day
Wish I hadn't, 'cause TiVo now thinks I'm gay
Oh, and Fear Factor, I watched maybe a half hour
After that, felt like I needed a long shower
Network execs with naked ambition
Next week on FOX watch lions eat Christians
Like to tie up those programming planners
Make them watch all that junk until their heads explode just like Scanners
Leech-covered, grub-eating fools on Survivor
Look, there's James Lipton discussing the oeuvre
Of Mr. Rob Schneider
And there's Gilligan and SpongeBob
Plus there's MacGyver
And Jay Leno has got Madonna
Hey, there's Luke Perry
And a special all Pig Latin episode of Drew Carey
Wanna turn on ET
'Cause I'm a gossip freak
And I gotta know who J-Lo is marrying this week
A 30-second spot
Welcome back to Are You Hot?
I was planning on recording The Sopranos — I forgot
I love shows with or without a plot
I'll stare 'til my legs are numb, my eyes bloodshot
Because I only have got one brain to rot
I'm gonna spend my life watching television a lot

[Hook]
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, they'd scold me, but I still tune into every show (oh)
My cable gets C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Sci-Fi Channel and AMC and Lifetime
You're gonna lose your mind watching TV
They told me, cajoled me, turn off that Oprah Winfrey show (oh)
I got it on C-SPAN, TVLand, and HBO
The Learning Channel and MTV and Lifetime
You're gonna...

[Outro]
You can watch anything you want to, man



[Skit]

[Intro: Eminem]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
(Okay, let's go!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
(Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey, like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A. 
‘Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
(And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent!)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, "Move," a bitch move

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk



[Intro]
Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Dre

[Verse One]
They see that low rider go by there, like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision
Or maico beats quake like Waco

[Verse Two]
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
They disgust, me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name n haters get murked
Bitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut
Missed the cut the lady give a raidy some paper cut
Now picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the same repetition is true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol The platinum duo's back on you hoes

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model

I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Verse Three]
It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player
Pimpin' hoes from here to Australia
Till I get heart failure
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared
Other half, hands up in the air, like "Awww yeah"
This is our year, this is what you call sheer talent
But I think at this point it's just obvious
Fierce, they say my music's good for all queers
Cuz I make your ear ring, get it?, piercin' all ears
Call us the Mafia, we got the fucking mob here
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year
Shit, I'm just doing my job here
You don't want no problem, do ya?
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us

And we're starting this party from dusk



[Intro]
"Other man!"

I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And many reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being obtruded
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?"
So I find myself in a certain obligatory
A place that I dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim at the reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? The hindrance is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one

[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another

Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
Wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the absence of unity is startling
"Oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
Damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild
Blessed with formidable talent and versatility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend

[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another..."

[Eminem]

You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No. so then why do you speak for me
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But ? is isolated, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted
Pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
His fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And others with nothing to say
Stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like Danny Kaye
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving



[Intro]
Hm crazy
They say everybody deserve a shot at love
That's bullshit
You live your entire life as a miserable bitch
Then you deserve to die a miserable bitch
Fack you
Good lookin' Em
Jump fast(?)
Trick Trick

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
Chick(?) to the waitress being me
I frequent the joint so she sees in me
More than an average customer
I trusted her
To bring to me what I ordered
Even a bottle of water
Met her in a (?) grabbed my (?)
All these legs and thighs
That catched my eyes
I got my mind on this five foot one
1-23
I lead her home to go out to see
Her ride the beat without the poles
She don't serve for free
She out for dope
The hustles(?) is clean and respectable
But (???)
But the way she came, whenever I called
Or waved my hand, you gotta understand
This (?) right here, had me gone
I knew(?) one day I drive her home
The day then came that she sat with me
It was a saturday, the club was empty
V.I.P. room, all alone
32 shots of patron (Damn!)
I know she gone, she can't drive
Big old(??) (??)
Takes us home, I can't lie
I wanna bone, but I'm to high
Not that I would take advantage of her
Cause I got patience and planning for her
Sunday morning she left my crib
She had to leave to get home to the kids
She rolled with me, spent the night
So why would I believe otherwise

[Hook: Throatslash]
I won't let them hate me (?)
She wanted a baby (?)
She's calling the police
I won't let them take me
She knew I'd fight back
I know she was like that
She scrambled(?) a signature
I swear she ain't write that
The way she was safety(?)
The way she could play me
Boms(?) are closing in, i'm patiently waiting
She offered to pay me
I thought it would ..ay(?) me
Despite what she may be
That woman is crazy

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
I like the fact that she laid with me
She said she had something to say to me
So much for the layout, so much for the plans
To my surprise, she got a man
Told me she was on her way to breaking up
So the vision of me and her waking up
After making love
Was far from death
The night was young, we laid in the bed
She had to leave to get home to him
Aggravated when I'm her thinking alone with him
She on the phone with him
Touched (?) dog but she's sucking on my lollipop (Damn!)
Can you believe this shit? (What?)
I am leaving this
Cause I can't see her leaving him (hell no)
It's been six months
And all me and her, whatever we did was fuck
And that's whats up
I got me one, but not the one that I'm speaking of
I'm out for love, but not with her
I've found me one that that get me what I'm dreaming of
I told it all out front of her line(?)
She told me no, she needed more time (What?)
I came to gree(?) this falling(?) yet
She keeps seducing me, calling for sex
Starting to pig(?) with a men at home
When all she did was trip when she had my phone
Like:"Who's that?, Who's this?"
Well, who is she to check(?) about another bitch? (What?)
I couldn't take another step further with (That's right)
This ignorance, she had to go
I told her to leave, she told me no
I forced her out, then slammed to door

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
So whatever this is, it had to stop
I knew for sure that she called the cops (What?)
They came to the door with a:"Knock! Knock! Knock!"
I thought it was her man, so I cocked my Glock
Y'all know me I asked her boat(?)
Damn police, you wouldn't believe what this men told me
Told me he loved to see me go
When all he had was a P.P.O.(?)
Slammed my door, now I'm pissed of about that ho
But that didn't take the cake or change the flight
Thief in the middle of the night
This last (??) Benz
Stole a sim-card and called my friends
Took a picture of her(?) ultra sound
With a note attached:"What you gon' do now?"
Sought me out with my brand new chick
She rode upon me:"Is that your bitch?"
Told me she wanted to kill herself
Eat a shotgun and and kill herself
I passed(?) for gas
Grabbed the .45 from out the stash
If she chase me then that's her ass
You can't catch me in my car too fast
Hold my cash(?), text my phone
Now i'm hurt(?) bitch told the feds
That I got the word(?)
Called my lawyer, checked it out
The alpha bitches(?) outside your house
Now this gon' get you most of all
She asked the judge and she post a bond(?)
On my behave she spoke up
It's 7 AM and I woke up

(coughing)

Man
Pfeww
Hell no
Gotta get my ass up

[Hook]



[Death Note Intro]

[Verse]
Oh my gosh
Look who's back
Joshter Jay is back
Joshter Jay is back and that is a fact
And you can get the ball
And you can get the sack
And you can get the dick
And you can get the cock
And you can get the will-ay
If you acting sill-ay
Turn me back up bitch
Make sure you can hear me
I'm a nice guy, so you shouldn't fear me
Please don't be afraid
I'm coming to your aid
I'm cumming to a picture of your mom while she's giving first aid
And I'll protect you if we are in a raid
And we can buy snacks and we can celebrate
And if you need money, then just sell your mate
No, don't do that, hold on, wait!
It was just a joke ha ha ha, JK
And I'm shooting from the AK
Because I am cray cray
Because I am crazy
I don't give a fuck even if you hate me
Your girlfriend really wants to date me
I'll even fuck a girl with an eye that is lazy
Yeah I got cash, even more than Jay Z
Nah I'm kidding, please please pay me
My chances were slim, just like Shady
Now I make money, and that is on the daily
I'm sorry for the bad news, but I slept with your lady
Soon she'll give birth, and I will eat the baby
I don't give a fuck, bitch, it doesn't even phase me
I'm losing my mind, please someone, save me!



[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty-four, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you



[Intro]
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? ‘Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?"
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing ‘cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, ‘cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor ‘cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!

[Skit]
DRIVER: Aight look
EMINEM: Uh-huh
DRIVER: Just go up in that motherfucker, get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there
EMINEM: Aight
DRIVER: I’ll be right here waitin' on you
EMINEM: Aight
DRIVER: Yo, Em
EMINEM: What?!
DRIVER: Don't kill nobody this time
EMINEM: Awwright… goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fuckin' nerves!
{*Whistling*} How you doin'?
TELLER: Hi, how can I help you?
EMINEM: Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
TELLER: Okay
EMINEM: Put the fuckin' money in the bag, bitch, and I won’t kill you!
TELLER: What? Oh my God, don’t kill me!
EMINEM: I’m not gonna kill you, bitch, quit lookin' around
TELLER: Don’t kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me!
EMINEM: I said I’m not gonna fuckin' kill you
TELLER: Don't kill me!
EMINEM: Hurry the fuck up! {*Gunshot*} Thank you!

[Verse 3]
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as-



[Intro]
Yo 'Pac
That's right, hehehe
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything
Yeah..
Niggas just wanna know
If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass nigga shit

[Verse 1]
Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47 layin' on my hips so I don't trip
One motherfucker from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch, the motherfuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin' the finger at police
Instead of them motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too

[Hook]
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too

[Verse 2]
Y'know you really can't say that ya blame niggas
Fuck being tame, set a flame, time to aim triggers
2Pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the Constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at each other (fuck no!)
That's my motherfuckin' brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin' TEC-9
They know they scared to see us sober
(ahhhhhhh) Cobra, and niggas'll take the world over
It's all up to you (up to you)
Blame the Korean.. (fuck that) or be a crooked nigga too

[Hook]
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too

[Verse 3]
Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too

[Hook]
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth, OOOH!
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth, OOOH!
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too



[Intro]
"Crrrry"
Dry ya face nigga (dry ya face nigga)
Get it together (get it togheter)
I ain't goin nowhere (nowhere)
O. Trice (O. Trice)

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna kill me, 'til a nigga done
Wanna peel my cap back, see a nigga gon'
All because I rap actual facts on a song
It's no fabrication, what's wrong (what's wrong)
Slung crack to the day come (day come)
But they don't wanna gimme that, say he fakin (fakin)
Schoolcraft is the makin (makin)
But God forsake 'em, they hate I'm great
Conservin them weight, to the Top 8 at 8
You whether see him wait, momma hypervenalate
Tuckin her son underneath the state (Michigan)
Hip-Hop's my fate, since cassette tapes
I've been braced what you know of, as this niggas culture
Put it in a chokehold, spoke as a soldier (soldier)
Yea he provoke him, to pull up out his holster
Leave you wit a visible ulcer, O gon' off ya
Niggas ought to when he lyrically offers
All cause he salty, I'm rollin like a boss
I don't follow nigga's course, I'm akward
My choice, Rock City is my voice
The White Boy stepped down, so I will accept the crown
Exceptional however, never let ya down
Found my new niche, no more bricks
So I'm pitchin 16's, verbally bitch

[Hook]
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Nigga cry now

[Verse 2]
Cry all you wanna, numero uno stunna
Then snuck up on ya, Lord what has become of us
The Boy hold the "D" down, like none other
Up comin since slums, can't knock them mothafuckas
So we, take shots at 'em, try to snuff 'em
Rather see 'em suffer, then become one up on us
Round the globe, promotin us hustlas
The white boy's cool, but refuse they brothers
So we, cock the tools, and shoot our own color
This ain't Detroit Red, you won't +X+ me out +Malcolm+
My Exodus will never be from a violent outcome
I turn Exorcist on niggas wit extra clips
Exit on my ethics, is no longer present
X-rays show, I was this close to Heaven
So for future reference, I stay this close to a weapon {*click-clack*}
Who you testin, never said I was the best, never stressed it
Don't make me get in my zone, I will own that whole note (fa sho')
Metaphorically, for where I roam on chrome yo (fa sho')
Detroit for niggas that's slow, it's the O
I was birth wit Jehovah's hand on my soul

[Hook]
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Nigga cry now

[Verse 3]
Can't explain the gift; but my aim is to take
What the streets gave my brain and spit
And I ain't evaporate, I will remain the shit
So ya lames that got a problem wit the game - tough tit
He still in the same Range, windows fixed
And I'm killin ya come a-gain, that's as real as it gets
Off ya, tryna make me depart ya, from my daugh-ter
Coffin's for you, and the nigga that brought ya
The hatin start in ya, release from our father
You people at the alter, saying ya better off
You don't wanna see the demon, come out of a humen being
Recent being the sience, and to him it's too extreme
Catch me in the BM, like 2Pac and them
Or in that Tahoe like Christopher - NO
Poppa gon' keep poppin Cris on you hoes
And piss on those, who exist as my foes
O rolls through shit, spittin cold flows
Knows his business, I'll be missed if I go
Who you know holdin the city on his shoulders
Flow is ferocious, it's O shit, true vocalist - BITCH!

[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Yo, mic check
(Woo, shit) Testing
One, two, um, twelve
What up? What up? What up? (Outsiderz)
This is my dance song, can you hear me? (Outsiderz)
(Rah Digga, Young Zee, bust it, bust it)
Alright, ayy, turn my headphones up

[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red like the bloodshed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I can't stand white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this

[Chorus]
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', "I suck" (I suck)
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud, "All y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

[Chorus]
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 3]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be"
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
"It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember, when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Chorus]
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

Eh….Wait…..Hello?

[Curtains open, followed by immediate applause of a crowd. Ominous piano music begins to play as curtains continue to roll back. Footsteps approach the mic, causing it to give off feedback. Eminem taps the mic, then clears his throat.]

Yo, is the mic on?

(Hello?) Hello? (Yes)
Hi, is this Curtis (Yes, it is) Hi, Curtis
(Hi) Hi, this is Curtis, I'm Curtis
My name is Curtis also (Oh, my name is Kurt)
Oh, that's really funny (Okay)

I was looking at your ad in the paper, um
I was wondering, you-you, you do sculptures? (Yes)
Okay, um, you're gonna laugh, um
This is kinda personal, but
I'm, um, a transexual
And I was wondering if, um, you could-
Are you there? (Yes) Ok, I'm s-I'm sorry
I thought you was gonna laugh at me, um
I was wondering, um, how much would charge, to like, um
Sculpt, like-like, if-if-if you were to make like, um
A sculpture of my body (Well, that's not what I do
I work in the steel and...)
You couldn't make a-a sculpture of, like um
My body (*cellphone ring*) (No) Okay, um
(It's not what I do, I-ah) Okay, you're yelling at me
(No, I'm not) Oh, I'm-I'm sorry
I thought you were, I thought you were yelling at me
(My phone is louder) Oh, ok (But, uh)
It sounds very loud in my ear
(Just to be, make it very clear, what I do) Uhuh
(Is geometrics) Oh (So)
What exactly is geometrics? (Well)
Cause I was trying to get like, just-
All I really wanted- you're probably gonna laugh, but
All I really wanted was, um, a sculpture, really
Of my penis, just for my girlfriend (That's not what I do)
(I don't know what to tell you, but, uh)
You can't make a sculpture of my penis?
The- Just (It's not what I do, sir)
Just my penis, that's it, just the head of my penis
(No, that's not what I do) (*laugh*) (Okay?) What?
Why don't make sculptures of penises?
(Well) This is (it's-it's-it's not I'm in- First of all)
You're being mean, sir, 'cause you put an ad in the paper
(No, I didn't, I put an ad in fo-)
You put an ad in the paper for penis sculptures!
This is really messed up, you're doing psychological damage to me
Physically and mentally
(You know, I have your phone number, by the way
So don't make obscene phone calls) I'm not making obscene (*phone ringing*) phone call
I'm being dead serious with you sir (Well I can't do that)
And you're making fun of me (I can't do that for you)
Is that a business you run there? (I put an ad in for trucking)
You're scaring me, what? Trucking? (Yes, you looked under "trucking")
(I don't have an ad for-) I thought I looked under "fucking"
Oh my god, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, goodbye



[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Bad Boy, baby
Yeah, yeah
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah
B.I.G. 2000, B.I.G. 2000 again

Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes (ah!)
While I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke—gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace—" smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
The Visa, capisce-ah? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fists like Cu-macho
I got so much styles (Uh) I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up," niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit (Yeah)
Sucking on the tits (Uh), had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humpin' around and jumpin' around
Jacked her, then, I asked her, "Who's the man?" (Mmm)
She said, "B-I-G," then I bust in her E-Y-E
(Yo, Big, you're dead wrong!)

[Chorus: Puff Daddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]

Who got it going on?

Who got it going on? (Who got it going on?)
You're dead wrong

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over, Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, unh
Leave you toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC
G's disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies; no ifs, ands, or maybes
Hit Mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis, after she sucked my dick
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that (ehh, uh-uh)
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with a broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon got the little hookers screamin' (Woo!)
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

[Hook: Puff Daddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on? (You're dead wrong)
You're dead wrong
Yo Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on? (This 2000, Bad Boy forever, baby)
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on? (Who got it going on?)
You're dead wrong
Yo Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on? (Ladies and gentlemen...)
You're dead wrong

[Verse 3: Eminem]
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin'
Horses' heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals, havin' sex with 'em
Camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kicked the habit
I just beat you to death
With weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket
I'm lyin', I got a 9 in my pocket
And baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours
Yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door
I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor
Get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth
I'm dead wrong

[Hook: Puff Daddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on? (You're dead wrong)

Who got it going on? (Born Again, yeah)
You're dead wrong
Yo Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong (C'mon)
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong (C'mon)
Yo Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong (*repeat to fade*)

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin': horse's heads
Human sacrifices, canibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit, I just
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
How many licks does it take to the center of my Tootsie Roll? (Or)
How many nuts to the center of your booty hole?
Hold on, shorty, cause I'm about to slap this groupie nigga
Jab this fluesy nigga, watch 'em bleed, then shit dookie, nigga
Spooky nigga, you gettin' skinny like you Pookie, nigga
Blood spill got you laggin' out like that soupie nigga
Smoke this Lucy nigga, time passin' on the frank mic
Watch 'em dyin' slow, then see ya skin, you start to change color
My goons lay the flood, leave you layin', drippin' blood
Then ended up fingerfuckin' your mother at a strip club
We dead wrong for how we gutter like how in the sudden
Fascinated how all of this street shit, we straight mother
Fuck it
We thug rugged to the tenth power
Like B.I.G. was listenin'
So Gimme The Loot for the past ten hours
Another dick
Hear the click of my gun cock
Same mentality when I was scheeming on a lunch box
Gimme that!
Twenty-focused and I'm sorry Campbell
I'm taking from you and your wife and run the baby Pamper (What?)

Repeat Chorus Til Fade



[Intro: Matthew St. Patrick]
DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration is eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp
Patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route, ETA: ten minutes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene
To receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, "I think I'll just have a taste"
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium
Like, "yeah, that's great"
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
"Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie 'cause I don't
And why, I just don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?"
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fucking hear
"Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"
"And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time"
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine
Sounds asinine, yeah, I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie' cause I don't
And why, I just don't know

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)
Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
"Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax"
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know



I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
"Come follow me into the gates of Hell"
I heard 'em yell "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners



[Intro]
Yeah
It's been five years since part one
To be honest brah most days I still feel the same
It is what it is man
Flowz Dilione
Depressed Confessions Part Two
Yo

[Verse]
Every day repeats and I just cannot get away
In every way I'm weak I wanna leave and just forget this pain
Memories engraved have left me mentally insane and every day I wake up praying that my family will change
It's hard to accept this fate, I know I'm not meant for this life and ever since the day of my birth I have been ready to die
I've severed all ties with anyone I've ever loved and look inside my eyes it's not hard to tell that my head is fucked
Destined for drugs I'm not supposed to prevail so fuck even trying to change when I just know that I'll fail
I'm hopeless and frail, unstable ready to snap, understand that once I turn that I can never come back
Just like my dad I see myself, every time that I look at him it fuckin makes me sad I wanna cry because he looks so sick
But I hold it in that's why I'm such an angry kid and if you've never seen me lose it you don't know what anger is
I let aggression out by putting blades against my wrist, I'll cave in the fuckin heads of people I'm not friendly with
Upon my enemies it's death I wish, sounds harsh but reality is so don't judge me for why my head's like this
The devil is in the same place where my mental is, burning in the flames of hell cursed for eternity
I believe I don't deserve to breathe I wish I could take the life I have and give it to the one who nurtured me
She raised five kids under one roof, mum if you can hear this just know there's no other like you
I know what you've been through and everything you have seen
You're so strong even though you are sick with disease and living with me is what has made you [?] peace
Forgiveness ain't free and for you I'm fuckin willing to bleed
If that's the price to pay I'll die today, willingly leave so you can fly away to brighter days and live on your feet
This is real talk and it's hard to speak what is real but I have to let it out cause it's too hard to keep it concealed
So to my older brothers, Jesse and Luke I know I act like I hate you both but I just pretend that I do
And my message to you is that acceptance is hard and watchin your lights fade inside has left me empty and dark
I'm bent from my past and I'll know I'll never be straight
A crooked mind I'm on my own no one will ever relate
Until I'm sent to my grave I'll fight this war by myself and I don't want any sympathy I'm not here crying for help
My mind is a cell I'm trapped and sentenced to life, stuck in a mental prison where negative energy thrives
I'm on the edge of a knife and I'm ready to fall, you see I'll never fly or ever see the heavenly doors
Preparin for war every day's a fight for me inside of me I'm battling depression, bipolar and anxiety
In search for sobriety I have become lost, that's the price to pay for addiction it comes at a cost
I'm fucked from the bongs, crack pipes have left me a wreck and pickin up the pipe is something I'll forever regret
I don't have any energy left, I'm sick of livin of Centrelink and paying off my tick with my rent assist
I'm on the list for mental benefits so I don't have to look for work or ever pay for any medicine
Our time on earth is never definite I'm ready I could leave in any sec end it all and just forget this shit
My death would be so effortless I'd just take drugs, pop a hundred xannies fall asleep and never wake up, my eyes forever stay shut
This is real life what I'm saying isn't made up, I don't say lies
But I'm surrounded by people who do and it's only when the smokes clears you see who is true
But fuck mates all I need is a bueg and a halfa and I'll be fine I'll live my life happily ever after
So if you think you know me you better think again, cause I can never be the person that you think I am
Cause I can never be the person that you think I am
So if you think you know me you better think again, cause I can never be the person that you think I am

[Intro: Proof]
Yo, ayo, turn the heads up and the mics up
We got the Dreadknaughts, y'knahmsayin?
Super MC, y'knahmean?
Bugz, Dirty and all that
All that shit, y'knahmsayin?
Desperados with the cars — Eminem!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Chauvinist pig, drove in this big Lincoln
'Til it went over the bridge
Jumped out and dove in the ditch
Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge
Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
I'ma go for your mids, here's a body blow for your ribs
While you're clutchin' your stomach
And bleedin' all over your bitch
I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
Unless she told me a fib, then I'ma have both of you did
Burning incense, facin' a murder sentence
Under intense investigation for killin' infants
While I sit in padded rooms, doin' shrooms
Havin' visions of dead pregnant women
With brooms jabbed in they wombs
Slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up
Stickin' up arbor drugs, and jumpin' in garbage trucks
I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
Give you a kidney punch and mug you to get me lunch
See me every summer layin' up against the dumpster
With a hundred dollar jumper, smothered in Southern Comfort
Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper
She came home screamin' a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her

[Verse 2: Proof]
Ayo, proceed to list 'em, there's no need to diss 'em
Down here we heat 'em, destroy your whole breathing system
Twist 'em, like beer caps, once they hear that
Rap murder rates, and I snap vertebrates
Collapse further states, my track preserve the great
Your pack deserve a crate: in fact, the word is fate
I'll kill you slow like AIDS-infested nuts
I'm holdin' vendetta like seven great-molested sluts
Callin' me a bitch nigga, you need to stop
Reality, one on one, how many times you got dropped?
I'm cut-throat when any track runs
Conscious when I smack nuns
The rough neck that make Muslims run and pack guns
I'm volcanic, the sermon preacher
Burnin' emcees, most wanted by Herman Kiefer
You tried to get a squad, they was like, "Money, oh no."
Leave you brain-dead, hittin' trees with Sonny Bono
I kick without a dojo, D12 slow flow
Shoot down your mothership and pimp-smack mojo
No pro wanna go knuckle-blades with the renegade
Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute-made
My lieutenant sprayed your brigade and trampled your flow
Big P, the reason emcees cancelled they show
The truth will hurt, seein' Proof at work, no shame in it
The best part of your show is when you put my name in it
My squad be godly, fearin' shit hardly
So I hope when I'ma die dope like Chris Farley

[Verse 3: Bugz]
Fuck that! Who run shit once these drums hit?
You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip for you to come get
Your click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask your girl, they know the scoop: don't fuck with Bugz, bitch!
I'll chop off her titty, have you suckin' one tit
Them pink belly niggas is who you run with
Makin' half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit
You could make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I admit that my style is unfit
For Momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch, I stab you in your armpit
Now, who the nitwit wanna come get with
This egotistic hip-hop fundamentalistic?
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bent shit
I smoked a blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Your bitch paid my bill, that's where the hell your rent went
Fuck that!

[Verse 4: Supa Emcee]
I kill competition, with no way out as an opposition
Execute the passengers on the flight, my executive decision
Then reminisce on how Shady the business
Terrorists asked by Israelis when they visit
Bombin' incentive, World War III in the makin'
Murdered the exhibition, team finish, beat the ref senseless
No time-out, extended play burns over your intermission
Then christen the battlefield with the blood of Christians
Cryin' for the Messiah, but he don't listen
I pop my wig when I top the stove frame, boil sizzlin'
A pyromaniac cook, I do damage to kitchens
Fuck Home Depot, I demolition
When I home improve, you need Bob here to fix it
Fuck school and supervision!
Bit off of financial aid and smoked up my tuition
Only hang around rappers with explicit lyrics
And pistol-grip punks for the beefin' — do you wanna get heated?

[Verse 5: Stilla Shellz]
I got a mind full of troubles, everything's in doubles
I buy my guns in couples, no time for placement fumbles
‘Cause emcees come and emcees go, with broke flow
Injured from head to toe, no fitter model, we full-throttle
You stuck in low, incapable to master flow
Everything is tactical, livin' mathematical
I smash the flow, unleash and let go
I shit like lava, original designer
Married to marijuana since a minor
Makin' attempts to sink my battleship
Could get you bent like fibs, what?
Applying death-defying feats, maintain to keep my peace
Flow like the sea when I release these beats over concrete

[Verse 6: 0-1]
My presidented transition has taken place
As I express vocally on the M-I-C-R-O
Power he cipher, not equality, I deal it
Lace the track and made it real, now I know my peoples feel it
Keep their heads bobbin' and the emotionals sobbin'
Plus a culture-cipher after shows, hoes slobbin'
Knobs love the fuckin' flavor of the icin'
Plus I'm precise and my double edge continue slicin'



[Verse 1: Eminem ]
Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust it and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and (Eminem)]
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
(What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right
Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight
'Cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)

[Verse 2: Eminem ]
You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and (Eminem)]
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
(What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right
Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight
'Cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)

[Verse 3: Eminem ]
Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
"What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture."
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, "The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and (Eminem)]
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
(What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right
Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight
'Cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)



[Intro]
Uh, uh, ha
Nah, fuck an intro, man, let's just go

[Verse]
I come around like what goes around, what goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down, might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe, last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch, get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought? And you want a ménage à trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a bar-room brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall, like a leech stuck in a vacuum y'all
Ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap, yeah, but I'm home
Bad to the bone, back in the zone, let him alone, you don't want to go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you own
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen, other words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop, Hitchcock of the shit, bitch ask Doc
Got it ziplocked in a bag, you fags ain't been able to fade me
Since Kid Rock had a high top, keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle
And I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog, get off my bone
This is my mic, doggonit; I like hoggin' it
Flow's so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganin', I'm waterloggin' it
I'm soggin' it, pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplexing it on cement
Like I'm on some "Straight Outta Compton" shit
Take this dick and chomp on it, I'm so bad I can bitch-slap a back-handed compliment
Jackass, eat a donkey dick, the game I just about conquered it
Like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit
I reign supreme in this honkey shit, no sense screaming and arguing
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in
You think you ball? Well, I palm it, I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelette
But you got egg on your face, now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze, bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy
It's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do and make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped, she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck outta Hell's Kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken
Yeah, it's Shady, slut, the rest can suck on a big one
'Cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'

Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet, he F with me
That G shall surely see, he definitely as 'bout it
As retail fraud, he's weak, the honest gesture
The trigger finger round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography Range Rover
This ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent-free (Real talk!)
I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea (That's Nickel)
Ridin' round his block
All he know is pitfalls, that's why he always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka!) (Sean Don)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut; no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin' (Brr, brr)
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self-made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette (Swerve)
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm over-respected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church, tryna get a little savings, yeah, a coupon (God)
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, "You still ain't got a new line?"
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel (Let's go,) lil' bitch!

[Hook: Dej Loaf]

Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
‘Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Have K's in front of your school, but I ain't goin' to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross-eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against
The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick!
I still never ABC this shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's ragin' and heated and
On the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if
I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't
Wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
Hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryna reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
‘Cause so cold in the D, it is
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
What made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and
Attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey, Em, let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'!
Detroit! Okay!



[Intro]
Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
What up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit
So it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit
We all hood, we love the gun smoke
A message from air traffic control
I'm doin' them niggas bold
Takin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes
Treat 'em like little hoes
Used to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles
When the booger sugar  took a light dose
Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor
With the white folks, in the window like a psycho
Puttin' the perfect play together; maestro
And since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me
You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go
Had a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though
Aiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle
Who might go loco and shoot for nothin'
Will go postal with you for somethin'
And I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Still pull it together for the kitty
Pour a little liquor for Biggie
And Frank NittI on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy
Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt
Switch a man's past from the revolt
Touchin' mothafuckas with the remote
Think your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Detroit V.S. everybody, P.S
Fuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do
Still, you can't deny the real
Time reveal, society squeals and the society kill
Money motivated though we take it
These cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly
Then they disappear within the same year
Like it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely
I'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em
Like a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor
Cause right after class
I teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass
Graduation, I rattle cages
We make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables
West 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop
Soft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot
You'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee
With the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers
You frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty
When I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me
Or the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes
You bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke
Until you get the big picture, mothafucka

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Black Milk]
Let the celebration kick off
This that point in the party where that person start pointin'
That pistol because they're pissed off
Shots lick off, fire spit off
This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off
The map, these rappers that recite raps
We don't believe 'em like that
Deadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back
But city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps
With them rap sheets that's long as track meets
So let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets
Where blacks and the trap meet
Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes
But them dreams got put in the back seat
And makin' fast funds the shotgun
Got some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl
They ask me "what is it like to see the rest of the world?"
Away from the block, away from the gutter
All they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover
So what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face
Tougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint
Posted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up
City soil that made us
7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers
>???< where the bullets strayin'
Fenkell where the bodies layin'
6th mile where them hollows sprayin'
Woodward where they ain't playin'
Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM
Gratiot where grandma's stayin'
Neighborhood that's decayin'
Niggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'
So fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall
And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls
Dudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy
Like a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty
Out here screamin' "Let's go", yeah my nigga X know
City where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 5: Sino]
I'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch
Anybody want some beef then we with it, bitch
Shit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action
Might be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'
No fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit
Dirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with
Shout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick
My city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)
Boy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this
I swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this
Street nigga, give me a ki and I'ma deal it
Better give a nigga his cash or you can feel it
What up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it
They say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it
My city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it
Still got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy

[Verse 6: Marv Won]
40287, I'm out that black bottom
If they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em
It's enough two faces here to attack Gotham
And ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em
Dot 'em, play possum, no brave option
All of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'
The nerve this nigga here can play the part of a goon
Transplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room
Wait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound
These red beams'll turn your white party maroon
I got a pair of gators that I hardly wear
Nigga I will kill you over these Cartiers
I got a couple bands with the dice on the floor
When I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow
Listen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'
Brother you know it's nothin'
Nigga I'm Coleman Young'in, tell 'em!

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 7: Payroll]
I'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots
And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch
Young niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim
And in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame
My future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains
If rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains
In the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis
Ain't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be
You see that D right above where my lid be
Can't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me
I bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that
Ain't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that

[Verse 8: Hydro]
Look I'm from Detroit, bitch
Where we crack heads and we break bails
Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales
Dreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of lake trails
They quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales
Young boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail
Screaming "fuck the cops" and quick to pop off like some fake nails
Shout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails
And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale
Holla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man
Try me and get cheddar on your head just like a Packer fan
Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van
And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan
Nobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on
Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on
Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?
And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong
It's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas
Fuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga
Boogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimey
Once I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 9: Big Gov]
My timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped
Like Jesus as a fetus
Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas
Needless to say I'm the sniper
Pick us off, niggas soft
While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher
I'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T
So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street
Home of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips
Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips
I'm from the city where the bitches even gangster
Suck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you
We don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to
Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through
And I don't even walk around with my chest out
But know it's drama when you see me with my vest out
My next route is finding out where you rest at
Catch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at
And the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit
I'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch
This shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if
A nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket

[Verse 10: Boldy James]
Detroit VS everybody, that's me against the world
I might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?
A thousand grams on my cock, later alligator
Moist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator
Never been a punk, faker or a lean whipper
Steady packing eighters in a one paper king swish
Concrete, definition of real street nigga
Whole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga
That really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit
Can hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce
For being four days late turning my verse in
But me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in
What was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?
I was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in
Text me when the work gone, I text him back the work end
Tryna get my hands on the pack when they first in
On my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire
But you being a liar is the worst sin
Keep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin
I'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin
I never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans
Been selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in
King James, before this rap shit I had street fame
And the keys to the city on my key chain

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]
Whoever said Vishis phony, get to know me
Our hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey
Guns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey
Riding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe
You think you hard? I think you doughey
His guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie
Homie, you owe me your life
I'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe
Wiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night
I now control machinery, it's like real steel
Gun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill
They say I'm fooling to 'em
They asked me for a hot sixteen
So I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em
Here's a DeJ Loaf punchline
I kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline
Try me, I bust nines
Stick a clock in his mouth and make him chew
Yeah, nigga, it's crunch time

[Verse 12: Big Herk]
We got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?
Y'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in
This what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men
Lyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10
And why Detroit always get a bad name?
My City ready to blow like we hit a gas main
These niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame
Man, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James
Fuck you and whoever you run with
I'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit
I'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight
Your flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)
I'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me
It's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me
Detroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that
Now every city all across the world want a part of this

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)

Street niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin' hardbody
Panorama fold up Porsche, let the car box me
I know niggas ain't sold shit, they did armed robberies
Rugrats buying out bottles and playing with old Tommy's
East side, come to the zone, that's where the lions play
Young niggas stepping on blow, that's where the tigers stay
In my hood the first of the month, that shit a holiday
These cemeteries meet their capacity every fathers day
Hit a lick, keep all the work, get the stolie back
Tell a jeweler don't say shit, just get the Rollie checked
If them niggas bump one lip then get your homies wacked
I swear that you knew my boss, bitch, I'm Tony Jack
Real shooters run in the trap with them choppers out
Heard them niggas bumping their gums, see what they talkin' 'bout
In a spot with so much syrup, this bitch a waffle house
Hit the pharma with so many scripts, could buy the doctors out

[Verse 14: Detroit Che]
I'm Detroit Che
I'm as sick as some syphilis, sicker than Detroit hate
If you come knocking then it's trick or treat
I call up Tricky, load that shit then let that trigger squeeze
That shit ain't sweet, I'm from the murder mitten
Never thought my friend would've been a murder victim
I'm in that van, I want revenge, I'm on some Kendrick shit
I'm pissed off like a mistle, his dick's soft, he's ticked off, he can't get shit hard
If you diss my city I will set it off with a motherfucking semi that's bigger than Big Sean
Our city is Marshall Mathers on Adderall
You better pray we not mad at all when them gats involved
With swisher cap, we're flicking your fucking city off
I'll bust your fucking noggin, you disrespecting my city, dawg
I'm queen Che been on the throne for a minute
Before the cypher I've been slicing dice, these hoes will admit it
Bitch, I'm Slim Shady, we louder than M80's
No, I'm just playing, hope he hears it, I'm just saying
I'm a renegade, pussy sweeter than lemonade
You'll never penetrate
DeJ, tell these bitches to try me, I'mma demonstrate
Vez, tell them that I got options, I'm a real estate
On them properties like monopoly
Detroit VS Everybody, I make a verse versus everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's Detroit Che versus everybody
Detroit vs everybody, it's Detroit vs everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's my city versus everybody

[Verse 15: Calicoe]
(I just have to talk shit for a minute, man
I have to get in my zone, man, huh
It's the going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, to Cali Cali)
Cali Cali, that's where I get them cheaper at
Your number like my number, I need a number I can reach you at
Want my price, then you get a price, I want at least a stack
You pay my flight, then you pay your flight, I'll meet you back
Middle man in my own plug, I can teach you that
Detroit vs everybody, who could compete with that?
You thinking everybody zips slow cause they got a plug?
My nigga, everybody zips slow cause I'm showing love
So whenever you make a flip again just know I'm showing love
If cash die, I'm on the strip again, just know I'm throwing dubs
Big roochies on the Michelins, rolling A1 dubs
Mind on my money, fuck a nigga tryna hold a grudge
Them crabs in the bucket used to slow me up
And now I'm sitting at the top and it's lonely as fuck
Got 20 thousand for my red bottoms
Cause I was standing in this blood after I headshot 'em, nigga

[Verse 16: Diezel]
It's me, bitch
Mafia captain, OG, bitch
20 years, been Detroit vs whoever, nigga
The right hand to the hand that be gettin' niggas
Goon squad mafia, mobbin'
For this dirty mothafucka, where it's my home
And I love this mothafucka
So I stood on the front line, ready for one time
Duck some shots, and buck bled for my line
All for the love of the palm of the dirty glove
Every hood, every block, nigga one love
7 mile is the hood where I came up
Pray the game keep it and get your weight up
Bitch you better say us when you're talkin' 'bout next
Detroit niggas stood up when put to the test
Like what? Nigga, who? What the fuck
Anybody wanna do? We ain't hear shit
One army, one city, one sound
It's Detroit, gon' shut shit down
It's time to return the king his crown
Fuck who got next, nigga we got now



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I make music to make you sick of fake music
Hate music like devil-worshipping Satan music
So say your prayers, your 'Hail Mary's and Jesuses
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you can't do it
A whole generation of kids blowing out their fucking brains to this
Kurt Cobain music. Students converted to 'caine users
As soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
What's your name?

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Judas
Got my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this
I got niggas that shoots to static. You don't understand
How I'm all up in you niggas' TVs like Carole Anne
I'm a poltergeist: lyrically, I'm supposed to strike
Try to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice
(Swifty get your own woman!) I want his wife
I'm the type to go to gamblin' parties with trick dice
I rob casinos. Slugs, eat those
You'd think it was the devil feedin' you jalapenos
Now you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes
My fo'-fo', prone to make you niggas breathe wrong

[Hook: Eminem]
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
It's like I'm on the john, trying to shit and get no response
Constipated, bitch; tell these pigs to back off
The mind of a rapist, Denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason; I'm a anus
Walk the street in a "Beat It" jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hat shit; I put my head on opposite and step backwards
A walking zombie that's ornery
Pulling armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camaraderie

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I can concoct the nine slot, plus I run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, busting wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standing by, thinking 'oh, what a mess'
Blast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs get dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz had felt
A deranged team, smoking ganja greens
This carbine'll make your fucking head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
And when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your [niece]
From her barettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet

[Hook: Eminem]
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
(Stop taking drugs!) I'm trying
My little boy is dying, he losing too much iron
And if I die, it won't be because I got shot:
It'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Taking drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass; let your little brother try 'em
Ten years is what I'm facing
Police breakin' in my house, Lil' Bow Wow in the basement (Jermaine!)
A rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fucking album comes out
I'm eighteen years old, still shitting the bed
Beaten 'til I'm red; fed nothing but water and bread
It's me again, fucking dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch, when I stick it in?
No medication; I'm out of Percocet
I lost my weed plus my fucking diaper's wet

[Hook: Eminem]
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)



[Verse: Eminem]
You know it's devil's night
The way that I smash the face of a punk in
Mask of Jason is a fashion statement since Drunken
Master tapes been a basket case
And if that's the case, then I'm dunkin'
Fascination with masturbation and humpin'
Lacerations and masking tape
And I'm bumpin' some Masta Ace
Roll up posin' as pastor Mase at a lunchin'
See Andrea Yates, grab her face, then I'm punchin'
Crack her fuckin' skull with an antique vase, kill her husband
To the back of the station wagon
She's dragged and placed in the trunk and
Now I'm wanted for kidnappin', rape, and abduction
Spread her legs like Land O'Lakes that I'm cuttin'
'Til every fuckin' limb's either amputated or punctured
Decapitated Christina Applegate and I rap like I'm agitated
No chill, but I'm half sedated
A functioning addict — wait, I'm in London?
Brains underwear? A pantywaist, classic case of disfunction
Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman
This game's over-saturated with junk and
You punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint
Razors and matches, path is laid for destruction
Put Jason Mraz's face in his ass
Then I'm snatchin' Anne Hathaway
She scratchin' like Jam Master Jay on the one's and
Two's, I slash away, then I'm dumpin'
Her ass in a Lake Placid for alligators
After I use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin'
The murder weapons, I stash 'em away on Runyon
Man, the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption
Lack of class displayed, but such a vast array in abundance
Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance
And, bitch, I'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin'
Balls come at you like batting cages
I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm comin'
Like I'm ejaculatin' and nuttin'
Come catch the clap like you're patty-cakin', lil' dumplin'
Or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an assumption
I'm back like I'm in the bathroom takin' a dump and
It's back in the day or somethin'
I'll shit on you, Devil's Night — how's that for a introduction?



[Intro : Lil Nibba, Eminem]

[Intro: Sway Calloway]
Alright, look. I seen these guys backstage. I'ma say it right now: There isn't a group in the rap game today, that lyric for lyric, can out-rap these next dudes. I know it for a motherfucking fact. I know it 'cause I'm from the West Coast and I was there when Crooked I first came on the scene. When Joell Ortiz first came on the scene. When Joe Budden first came on the scene, and one of the illest lyricists in the game, when Royce Da 5'9 first came on the scene! Welcome to: Our House, give it up for Slaughterhouse!

[Hook: Sly Jordan]
Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to ya
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through ya
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight through the radio
If you tryna be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna
Die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei
Tonight

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Nigga, this that shooter music, I'm about that life so much
I might go touch my rifles butt and my dick just might go up
Nigga, that nostril on that rifle'll knock the snot right out you
Try me and I try out ya
The drum on the gun is Beta like Phi Alpha
But there ain't no frat niggas in the hood be calling me Tackleberry
And if he's iron, he will have him a easier time trying
To put on some pads and go in and try to tackle Barry
Then he go against this god damn G4 buying, Detroit lion
I'm about that life so much I might go golf
Trying to get me a hole-in-one to remind me of like when I go off
Homicidal thoughts, bodies outlined in chalk by the time it's dark
Dahmer signing his name on a dotted line with a bloody body part
I don't give a fuck if they wilding, I got a clip full of fucking Ray Allens
Selling that Sarah Palin, in broad day or Letterman Fallon
When I shoot this iron, all you hear is hooping and hollin' like
(Bombs away) Bootsy Collins

[Hook: Sly Jordan]
Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to ya
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through ya
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight through the radio
If you tryna be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna
Die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei
Tonight

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
They shot my nigga three times, as his abdominal bled
They robbed him for phenomenal bread, that domino led
To other dominos fallin' in his clique, off with their heads, sick
Saw him in that hospital bed, leaned away from the doctor and said
They'll all be dead soon, and I'm talking before that nurse can change the IV
I'ma put em in the dirt, leave em leaking raspberry flavored ice tea
My G, kill him and take his ID
I'm a renegade like E-M-I-N-E-M and J-A-Y-Z
Bitch it's karate, it's Mr. Miyagi mixed with Issey Miyake
Smell that chopper kicking when it's lifting ya body
Quick as Bugattis, then I'm hitting the Omni
With a chicken licking my dick in the lobby; this New Edition, I'm Bobby
Fast laner
I'm speaking the truth, put 3 in the coupe
I'ma wet your head like a leak in the roof
Then I'm leaving the booth for gas chamber
My granny calling me a rap singer
But she don't know I use my strap finger

[Hook: Sly Jordan]
Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to ya
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through ya
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight through the radio
If you tryna be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna
Die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei
Tonight

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Look, this a whole 'nother "Ether"
Hop out, black mask, low Caesar
Tell the goonies keep it low with the reefer
New bodies on old heaters
We ain't rapped too tight
Starving, they thought Jeffrey Dahmer had appetite
I'm detail, not derail
Don't lay your head if you shit by it
Got skeletons, but my shit private
I paved the way, y'all misguided
So try it, I'ma send a threat
Tie her up don't end her yet
Bullet go through your wife's eye now we know you ain't on the internet
In my head I see amateurs, can't retain a memory
All I'm left with is images
With that I'm putting emphasis
And in parentheses
Put he's hated by large percentages
And all my nemesis won't even let 'em on the premises
One shot, change him for life, he'll be belligerent
Even his text messages are gonna read like he's whispering
Bulletproofed the hoodie for Trayvon Martin
Then go to war with the cops, even they aren't pardoned

[Hook: Sly Jordan]
Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to ya
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through ya
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight through the radio
If you tryna be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna
Die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei
Tonight



[Intro: Kobe]
Just so you don't die alone

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Bridge: Kobe]
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you?
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone



[Hook: Eminem]
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
My life is like a highlight reel
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step, pacin’
Don’t know if I’ll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre’s in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I’m sick

[Hook: Eminem]
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
It’s on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
They're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep’
Yep, face it, the fans they’ve been upset yet patient, I love ‘em for that

[Hook: Eminem]
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight



[Verse 1: Eminem]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to, but I do
Yeah, I say it now when you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now?
But somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
To them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
Minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now—Jesus!
And everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
Man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck I'm s'posed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', "Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!"
Until we meet again, Doody

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"Doody," that's what we'd call each other
I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moanin', I just wanna get home and
I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like, "You're gonna fry," you're like, "No, I won't
I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin
In their skin—we don’t burn," meanwhile my face is glowin'
And I feel like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughin' at me
And snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way, them Playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well, Nate finally got 'em back, shit
It must've been at least sixteen years ago
Well, I put 'em in your cask—oww
Movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop, dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', "Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!"
Until we meet again, Doody

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like "Fuck rap!"
It feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
Don't ever give up the dream, dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together
Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker, Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on Dresden
From eggin' cars to paintballin' and gettin' arrested
To sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and… what's his face? I forgot his fuckin' name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
And that’s on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alaina’s name
I'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
In the air for you and pour some liquor out
With Obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
We were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Doody!



[Eminem]
Good morning children!
My name is Dirty Steve, I'll be your substitute teacher for today
(Clinton Sparks!)

Come with me, don't be so mad, angry little man
Dirty Steve will be here soon, he will hold your hand
Walking through the forest, he will show you porno mags
You can beat his dick while he sucks yours, cuz he's a fag



[Verse 1: Eminem]
My music is therapeutic
But it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to
Jump out your car while it's movin'
You been waitin' on this moment
My sermon is like a omen
I'm servin' I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open
And I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book
Go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it
Rummage,and find something
You can use to jump someone
And roll up bumpin'
I'm constantly copin' over you
Squattin', shit has gotten to the point
Where I ain't even writin' no more, I'm just jottin'
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickenin'
I've been kickin' ass off bullshit
Throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Cannabis
Then it's Dre's fee, you Kay Slay the fees waved
I stay beefin' with JD, till the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin' him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape
And the tape leaped, "Say What You Say" mothafucka
Drama King, Kay Slay, mothafucka, We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka
Xzibit blaze little gay midget cocksucka

[Interlude: Xzibit]
Ladies and Gentlemen!
This is dedicated to the man we all love to hate
Tattoo a.k.a The Leprechaun a.k.a. Mr. Jermaine Dupri
Come on ladies and gentlemen, sing along

{​​​​​​​Randy Newman - Short People Sample)
(Short people got) What! (no reason) Yeah!
(Short people got) What! (no reason) Come On!
(Short people got no reason to live)
Haha fuckin' faggot...

[Beat changes to the beat from Clipse's "Grindin'"]

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
If ya So So Def than bitch get a hearing aid
Ain't worth ya gauge ya heart pumping lemonade
Hook, line and sinker ya took the bait
Act ya age, not ya size, not ya weight
Every time you professional making hits
Why it always gotta sound like the next men shit?
Went from Big to Puff to Snoop to Jay
Hey Jermaine who's dick you gon' ride today?
Couldn't wait to get the green light from Dr. Dre
Never liked ya fuckin' ass any goddamn way
And I could care less if we label mates
Your style been dead Colombians should drop the weight
I got love for Da Brat get off Bow Wow back
Fuck you, fuck ya niggas that's writing ya raps
What up lo get ya L.A. pass revoked
Don't get me wrong Papa Smurf you won't get smoked
But ya might get robbed and choked
Or you might disappear, kidnapped with no ransom note
Off the leash, off the hook, off the chain
Fuck Jermaine you ain't gotta say my name
Speak now or forever hold a dick in ya mouth
You ain't the mayor, you don't run shit in the South
Scarface run the South motherfucker you will be on
The underage bitch in the Kelly tape getting pee'd on
Cock-eyed midget with a Napoleon complex
Nickelodeon fetish you represent nonsense
Harlem Shake to that, high jump to hell
You the best in the business, I can't tell
Too late to apologize kiss my ass
We about to cut your whole sound scan in half
Got to keep your hands up homie protect yo'self
Stop fucking with the West nigga respect yo'self
It's a short ride to the top and a long way down
Look Man vs. Machine about to drop now
This ain't no beef it's more like lunch meat
Loss caliber heat let's take it to the street muh'fucker

Ha ha...ha ha....ha ha.....ha ha ha ha ha ha....haaaa ha ha ha ha ha
Oh my god...yeah, yeah



[Verse]
Come here spittin' with non written
Non fiction
Rappers try to step to this with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashing and bashing and crashing
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex or I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chilling with Phoenix
With two Coronas I'm on the microphone and I'mma own this
Yo and I'mma bone this
In Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable
I'm on two turntables
With my man
But he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only 5'4"
Yo check it out, I bust rhymes and get groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter he wasn't insulted
He said "I'm 27 years old. Yo, I'm an adult kid."
But yo, still
Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'mma always gonna build and kill
My baby's mama just to piss the world off
Just to piss the girl's off
Yo, I hurl off
The top of the building
Kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrist's tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it
Yo, y'all couldn't conceive it
It's Slim Shady
I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out and you can keep it
Just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret
Like Pop Secret
Rappers, they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfuckin' D



[Intro: Eminem + Hailie]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up, baby?
I don't know, but I don't want to
Grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids
Ha ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here, baby! Bring Daddy his Oscar!
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, ‘cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, ‘cause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
"Regime" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday – how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, "Reenact him, you go platinum!"
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Verse 4: Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli; get your own identity!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Over hook]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! I'll fuck you up, boy! Never!
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life…
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Outro: Obie Trice]
That's right, motherfuckers
Shady records, what you know about it?
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah, fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade

[Outro: Hailie and Eminem]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
No, honey, you guys are the same size



[Intro: Xzibit & (Eminem)]
Pssh, man, I need a lighter, man (Right here!)
Yeah… whassup, Slim? (What's crackin'?)
Hit this shit (Shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today)
Psh, is that right? (What is it with motherfuckers thinkin' that
Because we're in the spotlight, or whatever, that
They can do or say whatever they want to us
And that we won't retaliate?)
Protect my motherfuckin self, by any means necessary (Right)

[Hook: Eminem]
‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Being underrated gave me time to create
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin' but hate
Millionaires snatchin' crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows
You know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home
But my baby mama hate my guts and can't stand me
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin' for what, so I can blow up?
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
Fuck that! This the fuckin' thanks I get
For tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch?
Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down
‘Cause you seein' more support than I'm seein' my child

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like, every day I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive survivin' this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News
To follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it's unloaded, full or an unregistered one
No bullets? You're so full of shit
This clip is so full, it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parking lot with a dude
Over Kim, and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit
Don't tell me 'bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch

[Hook: Eminem]
‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
This ain't business, this is personal, bitch
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very fucked up day, I'm needin' this fifth
Shuttin' motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the fifth
Yo, Em, it's time to get serious with it
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth
To my niggas who never seen it, I mean it
When I holla at the top of my lungs
About my guns and my loved ones
Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano
Ridin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like Tony Soprano: who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines, just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke – that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn 'til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself, a front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that! I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place
Tryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face
And it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn
Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit
Or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them
That if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters blow it out of proportion
Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans
Just for tryin' to stand on his porch
And I'm the bad guy, ‘cause I don't answer my door, like, "Hey! Hi! You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!"
Sometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle
And climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you
It's just that when I'm not behind the mic, I'm a person who's just like you



1 I'm not so big on the idea you got
You got to be slave for the people a lot

2 The style is way big, pervasive a lot
To follow the mass, miss on the shot

3 y’know, you're denying the gift of the god
It's not time to bed, but you gone to nod

4 k wake up be big on to work your mind
And don’t you be a wuss, go start your grind

5 Live your life the way you wanna live, savvy?
Dont raise a stink, hold as well for the heavy

6 boy, I won't subscribe to the thought you got
Muna move off, give it some big shots

7 crucialize the element within you ability
Take it like a man, n stick in stickability

8 don't you hurt, will be veered it once
Suck the hell balls, live your funs

9 boy, ease is big bad for the success you want
Mama's boy you can't get the access you want

10 failures are heralds of prosperity
Big deal? no, no, it's typicality

11 to be muckety-muck, top dog
Work you ass off, don't fog

12 you wanna be big kahuna, alright
You gotta stand big for it to fight

13 world's like a big house, you don’t know
If you then stand fight, it will show

14 everybody asks height, over big league
But no kid work tight, over big league

15 Here’s the big one, big fear
But aplomb within ya makes clear

16 meditate within ya, muse upon
Big wheel, you will get on n on

17 Work your ass off to big sleep
Don't care, the sea is how so deep

18 capture big picture, of the run
Guide a big tent then, to be dun

19 Learnin’ your ownself, a big time
Walkin' your big talk, is no mime

20 if you awake twenty four, so big woop?
Wanna be a big name, let the whoop

21 keep in mind one thing, in your mind
Don't go to be big-head when you find

22 what you got within ya is so big
Big-ticket you will get if you dig

23 everything you got in, is to bigfoot
You gotta strike 'em, act afoot to put

24 Gettin’ to what you want, is bigger fish to fry
To struggle with the world, either you win or die

25 gettin' or lyin' low, to bigger picture, boy
May you sleep a lot, or prolly let the joy

26 I see too big for their britches, a lot
They faced the flops and nothing they got

27 but I see knee-deep in the big muddy
Sucked a big one, hit the big got ruddy

28 I have eyes bigger than my belly
In the case, I want ma success smelly

29 I bite the big one, take ma hits to death
But never give ya big head, bits to death

30





 Qais



[Monologue: 50 Cent]
Yoooo!
This is the invasion
I'll beat you motherfuckers, and get invaded
Shady Records, Aftermath
Get down and pray

[Skit/Background: Eminem]
"Eminem..."
"No..."
"Eminem!"
"No..."
"Hahaha. Wake the fuck up, motherfucker."
"What do you want from me?!"
"Hahahaha. Remember me?"
"I killed you!"
"You thought I was dead, didn't you?"
"What do you want from me?!"
"I'm alive..."
"Oh, God..."
"Get up."
"No."
"Get up and look in the mirror."
"I don't want to!"
"Look in the mirror, it's just a reflection. Haha"
"Leave me alone!!!"
"Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me! Look in the motherfucking mirror!"
"Leave me alone!!! Leave me the fuck alone!!!"
[Eminem punches the mirror, breaking it.]



(Ed. Note: Please help finish transcribing.)

[Verse 1]
Livin' like a sleuth
... ingenuity
... voraciously ... acuity
...

[Hook]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

[Verse 2]
...
Tossin' curves that are nerve-wrackin'
[Irv?] slackin' I'm throwin' pitches uh switches
Which is trickery, victory's repetitious
Though weaker ones and overeager ones that just get ate up
Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
...
Frostbite

[Verse 4]
You take out crews by yourself take out this one
I'm a soloist chaos is a soloist pick one
He's about to put more tracks in your soul
And put your crew in a pile and jack em up like a totem pole
I give you a dance and make you change direction or
Have a spot reserved in a handicapped parking section
How the hell can you leave when your trainless?
Your smooth sailing hit a storm and looks likes your failing
Left a band stranded empty handed
Put so much as a toe in my way and get branded
I'm standing colossal drag you out like a fossil
With a rap so hot it will cause a snot in your nostril
Take you out take you out with simplicity
I'm shocking so bad I'll make you shit electricity
Try flip me or whip me you fucking fed bon appetite eat the concrete dick head

[Hook]

[Outro]
...
When will he ever learn?
I guess never



[Hook]
Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out
So when you find yourself in pieces

[Verse 1]
As a child I was foul
Ma, I couldn't understand them things that came out your mouth
(Daddies ain't shit)
You would fuss, cuss 'til your blood pressure was up
Then give up and slouch on the couch and drink your liquor
(Fuck you boy)
A hard-headed nigga I was, quick temper
Short attention span not attending class
What a dummy, I would run over you honey
You confront me and say Obie you no longer have a Mommy
Don't use my phone, don't even eat my food
Matter of fact, don't speak and it was just me and you
In the house, with that mouse and them traps and that gat
Waiting on the day for you to pull the trigger back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You trying to kill me boy, that's what you wanna do kill me
Ma you're not feeling me, the beef is not that drastic
Weed blasted bastard, you're lying (You're lying!)
You tuck plastic freezer bags with dope inside of em
She knew, but she hated that it was true
I done raised two boys, I can do away with you
The locks changed, and the nights got colder
I'm slanging boulders, looking like a boulder toker
But fuck it, I'm the Obster, I'm down for mines Ma
She ride by my corner like, I'm not gonna cry
I would not reap the pain of watching my youngest man
On the corner slanging 'cane, fucking calling the cops

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ma, even though I left the house wrong
Seventeen years old on my own, using these streets as my home
There's no reason to prolong this beef dear, I love you
Ms. Eleanor Trice I place no one above you
You the reason when I hustle, I knew to stack
The reason when I opened up mics I knew to rip
The ethics you enstored in this hectic young brother
Rubbed off after all, now look at your boy
When they ask about me now you won't just put your head down
Straighten up Ma, you can smile now proud
Everything's kosher with the boasterest Obster
Let's get closer, so regrets never approach us

[Hook] (2X)



[Verse 1]
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
‘Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the "dope"
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every 60 seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
‘Cause they were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
‘Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say "Bon appétit!"
‘Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
‘Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
‘Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down!
‘Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 3]
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, ‘cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
‘Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of genius—Elizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't group me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Who's mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned
Hah, bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

[Outro: Buckshot]
You know I got you open kid, stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life...



[Intro: Sam Kinison]
"You wanted to party fuck yeah let's go"

"Come on come on"

[Verse 1: King Crook]
The only ones looking down on me that matters now are Anthony
Big RJ and Philly B Bobby Ben and Archie B
I see these haters charging me with hate they spew its hard to see
Who you really are you just spit bars I'm like a pharmacy

Im medication for the sickest sleep on me I sleep the witness
Reap benefits spitting this shit pistol whip it with my Bic it's
Fricking sickness keeps me going flow's still growing I'm the wickedest
Im so sick in this yet so sick of this but I'm still spitting this I am too literate

You are despicable I am the pinnacle I am original killing a syllable
Pinning the minimal effort to kill it hoe summer to winter yo Ima go kill it yo
No wack mc's as far as thee eye can see I can see
Through the smoke you fucking joke ain't on the same level as me

Used to be the rapper that they said was a gimmick
Now half the rappers that I birthed hear a verse and try to mimic
Name a flow in this neighborhood thats more authentic

When it fires I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every 60 seconds that go by so you know I meant it

Im so rare I'm like the lochnees monster no lobster sees that I'm the prodigy mobster I'm like some pasta
You imposter noodles should get Oscars stupid acting no ones hotter than you king robber students cuz even Robert can do it

Just as well I'm sure as hell the first to tell my verses well since 2016 put every beat in hearses yell I murder well
Cuz bitch I'm just like versus spelled I could never tell what kinda word I murder double meaning for the verdict guilty cuz I'm first as well

Charge you like a MasterCard or Durecell and i got it twisted cuz ill catch a charge and you versus these verses ain't working well

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 2: King Crook]
Reno Scalisce told me I sound like shady easily but didn't know what it means to me to be the B E S and T
Its always been a dream for me ever since i watched baby on board but now these babies are boring telling their stories
Tell these whores I'm back for more because I'm eating all these cats its like pussy galore but its too foreign for these bores

To come and take my throne you're wasting time cuz I'm the thorn inside ya side beside these horns Im a fucking demon thats for sure
I fucking sweat these bullets through my pores and through my floors you hear me sore and kill these beats in 4 in 4 in 4 in the morning you whores are boring

You sleep on me son of jazzy I still got un-colaric
Energy for anything you throw at me so you better prepare for it
Get ready for war this lord is ready to settle the score with whores
I call you whores cuz you'll get fucked in this shit times four

Mincing words with pens I pin this shit absurdly so observe me I'm perverted dirty might have scurvy I know you heard me
Non-suburban burban sipping urban kid a wordsmith learning verbal abuse to use my skill to drop these bombs like I'm wearing a turban

Sicker than German serving canibal jews a jewish person cooked and burned to first or third degree but can't you see I'm worst than
The dirty versions of that line I was inclined to scrap but I thought to myself that if I tone it down then ill be fine

Dont act like I'm not godly with the flow like shotty's mixed with laden bombs I'll probably get on the FBI watchlist mommy
Im sorry I'm not sorry but fuck Selena give me Ari and cut that bitches head off and ask you if its gaudy

My inner slim entered the mix and gave you a twist like the neck of the exorcist
Whos next to this cuz me and jazzy share number one we're the best in this so don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 3: King Crook]
Used to get bullied now nick's bullying this same generation that would come take a shit on him and with this
He would use for ammunition a petition with his controversial shit that verse his spit was too fucking lit
But not even the tip of the iceberg when I spit cuz now all my fucking shit is like a mah fucking pinch
To wake you up to realize that he's the shit too legit to quit hell stick to this til he's 6 feet deep and stiff

I think he needs a trip away from this shit and manure move to somewhere so secluded and exclusive that you're doing
Fucking circles while ya zooming through the streets to find him nuisance he's so deep underground he's glued in the dark corners of his mind spewing
Raps just dropping back to back addicted to this shit in fact he might just crack without his pad and pen to vent and just attack
But now he's back little hibernation rhyming patiently now he's angrily bombing babies the year old shady knockoff's knockoff I'm amazingly

Spitting ridiculous flow switches I hope bitches do you know that nick is the goat shitting on bitches and hoes while syllables getting the ringer and more
So watch out he's a wasp thats stopping opps and mopping up the competition you incompetent kids can get stung but I won't drop
Im immortal never normal nor will I be fucking formal form a former group of kids that used to get lit and do stupid shit
But now were ruling shit these new school kids are doing too lit shit so cool it kids you're drooling when we are just starting to spit it

But its cool to spit it goulish bitch you foolish kids are fooling with
The truest newest shit who's using new school kids and hooligans
To drown these tools in pools of kin you all really need to listen
In unison just to thicken my bulletproof proven skin

My new vision to start dissing all who listened to blue ribbon
King crook songs and call it stupid cuz now I'm fucking too livid
Im zooming through you're newest shit this is the year of the crook stupid
So just look cupid ain't shooting arrows through these bitches who is doing

Anything out of their way to say you better than me I'm too persistent
Stupid bitches don't front

[Outro: Buckshot]
You know I got you open kid, stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life...

[Outro 2: Sam Kinison]
"I'm having a GOOD FUCKING TIME"



[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Pictures of plenty, sippin' my glass full of henny
Hands on my semi—automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the track out, my lyrics never fail me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it
And you can love and you can hate it
But you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant
But you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm fronting man you better come confront me for it

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt
I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh
That's that nigga wit' the fake, blaow!
Why you punch me in my face?
Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket

[Hook: 2Pac]
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Often, it's a young nigga, in a coffin
Tryin blossom, got shot down walkin, heh
Bleek a high to hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like yay-yo
Nigga's pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me
Motherfucker don't sleep

[Hook: 2Pac]
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep



[Produced by Eminem]

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
Shady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit
Rap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over



I ain't got time for this, man I'm out

[Chorus]
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)

[Verse One]
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm goin crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous, just give me space and we'll get better
And maybe we won't argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where you been and who you wit, I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive, gimme grief when poppa leave
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support me that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?

[Chorus]
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)

[Verse Two]
Callin at my house then hangin up, you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our seperate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're sayin I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I, cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but you're lyin
Fightin back the urge to just start cryin
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me?

[Chorus]
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)

[Verse 3]
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin at me
Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional, you know me
Comin over cryin just to get me feelin guilty
You and me were meant to be and yet
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
Don't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie
This time I'm breakin out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin and the griefin
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leavin
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
And I can give you more when you mature
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but SEE YA
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin
Not because we rushed it
Don't you trust me?

[Chorus]
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)

[Outro]
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you

"Mr. Yayo, you're free to go
So, I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow, eh?"

{*Eminem laughs*}
Yeah! Ha ha, guess who's home?!
Tony Yayo! Yeah! Obie Trice, c'mon!
(Here we go now!)

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma cryin'
‘Cause her only son is dyin'
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I'll poke you, man, I'm Rikers Island Pokemon
I got CO's bringin' me filet mignon
But now a nigga home, lookin' frail in the drop (whattup?)
With a bitch shotgun that's inhalin' the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got Glocks in the Lex, so we ride behind cops
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossin' borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full-body armor
Soning niggas, like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two-shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR-15 bending your six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma cryin'
‘Cause her only son is dyin'
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Since Yayo is home, them AR's is drawn
Obie's Guerilla-Unit, fuck affiliation
We are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
The .40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant {gunshot}, another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperment
And we holdin' them K's, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages?
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues
His short fuses put your portrait on the news
Nigga, them screws is loose
When you fuckin' with them Shady dudes

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma cryin'
‘Cause her only son is dyin'
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And y'all rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the MAC
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
‘Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like Keyzer, Jayson Williams, slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga, check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke?
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats?
It's the rap tycoon, Tony, y'all all know me
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doin' time in the pen

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma cryin'
‘Cause her only son is dyin'
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter



[Intro]
"What am I, a mirage?"
"What?"
"What? Where's my fucking drink? I asked you for a drink."
"You wanted a drink?"
"I just asked you for a fuckin' drink."
"No, I thought, I thought you said that you were alright, Spider,"
"No no no no no no no no. What do you got me on, a fuckin' pay-no-mind list, kid?"

"To attack without knowing the enemy's strength is foolish. After being warned, to still attack is stupid. People who are that stupid just don't deserve to live. But strangely though, one does find people who are that stupid."

[Verse 1: ?]
Where the fuck you stay at? Habitats and [?]
[?] Back the fuck off me, drink some coffee
Particularly decaffeinated, ICP is overrated
And hated for the false identity created
You ain't equal, but classy people
Evil Kenevil [still dropping?]
Deep sea divers
...

[Interlude]
"Seems to me that you're quite confident you can beat me. You don't scare me, let's get to the point!"

[Verse 2: ?]
1, 2, fuck it man
Your image got cremated, you ain't get off
Like [?] paper that's preparated
I created this statement and called you out
When you changing my style
...

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo I'm two-faced, and bugged the fuck out like Mr. Furley
So when I swing a fist of fury y'all can kiss the jewelry
Scrap, back the fuck up, we missed the brewery
Hurry, I'm tryin to pick up Cage's sister early (It's 8 o'clock)
Me and Greed smoke weed and OD
We're so keyed there's no need to stop the nosebleed
I need a casket, I killed some conceited bastard
And beat his ass with a bat wrapped in a sheet of acid
I'm pre-disaster, I fuck shit up before it happens
Like blown engines of airplanes with snorin' captains
Your style's monotonous, like a borin' job gets
I come to the battle and beat you with foreign objects
I'm dumber than Oklahoma ignorin' bomb threats
I'm dumber than trying to start a war with 'nam vets
My metaphors are like a set of jaws
I get applause, cause people would rather hear mine instead of yours
Still on the run from stabbing a bitch in the side
So I'm hitchin' this ride with the motherfuckin' Indiginous Tribe

[Verse 4: ?]

[Verse 5: ?]

[Intro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
Obie, yo
I'm sick
Damn, you straight, dog?

[Hook: Eminem (&  Obie Trice)]
That's why I ain't got no time (I think I got chlamydia)
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits
Sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely the pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
"Don't stop!"—the response I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated, ‘cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)

[Hook: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me
To throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't, ‘cause this bitch has been visitin'
Someone else and suckin' his dick and
Kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they told you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it
So you jet back home, ‘cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
‘Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us

[Hook: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Outro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches!
Fuck 'em all!
Get money, Shady Records
Ha, whoa!
Obie Trice! Eminem, motherfucker!
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off man, turn this shit the fuck—



What I wanna do, let me see right here, yo

Not many people that I label
Would be able to display table
Manners but my plan this
To make this beat rock like scanners
And make the fans just go bananas
Yo, get our Planters
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't understand this
Yo, my clan is
Yeah right, and y'all gon' stand there
And act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Check, check this out
And if you're rockin' with your necklace out
That's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo my style is rechid, you can't fetch it
No you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause your name I can't even pronunciate
You're the sa-same type-a mo'fucker
To go and suckerpunch Dre at the Vibe Awards
But he right behind the boards the next day
So, kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick
Eat my ass
Whatever you wan' do, it's on you
Big Proof comin' through..



[Intro]
Yeah, boy
Them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Buh! Buh-Buh! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, fuckin' bumbaclot
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothing but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal, and Charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee in this bitch
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly by the seat of his pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce, and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing; no, nada
Like your father fucking your mother

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the rap Crown Royals
That scalp cowboys, now, how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're about to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whoop-ass on you, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage, and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy, you didn't go there, no, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got, whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin', ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot
When the bomb drops, boy, does it drop
And when it does, boy, there's a problem

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)

[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, sing 'em telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit?
Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady-fuckin'-Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Bridge: Eminem]
It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone



[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
Aight, guess what? I ain't comin' in yet
I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, "Yo, what the fuck we'd do?"
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
‘Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably
Gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Outro: Eminem]
Drugs really got a hold of me
Really got a hold of me
These drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me



[Dr. West]
"Morning, Marshall."

[Eminem]
"Morning, doc."

[Dr. West]
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"

[Eminem]
"Ah, anxious."

[Dr. West]
"Anxiety?"

[Eminem]
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."

[Dr. West]
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now
You're sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this
You found a sponsor yet?"

[Eminem]
"Um, not yet. But I mean, when I get back..."

[Dr. West]
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."

[Eminem]
"Well, yeah, I mean I gotta start going to meetings first and...
Wait, what?"

[Dr. West]
"Well, I mean you don't absolutely have to go to meetings
I mean it's not like... a requirement
If they fit into your schedule, I know you're a busy person."

[Eminem]
"Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing?"

[Dr. West]
"So what else are you thinking?"

[Eminem]
"Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and
I mean, learn 'em, and start being able to apply 'em."

[Dr. West]
"The steps?"

[Eminem]
"Yeah, the steps."

[Dr. West]
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?"

[Eminem]
"Well, twelve, but–"

[Dr. West]
"Christ, I don't even know them all."

[Eminem]
"Really?"

[Dr. West]
"Anything else?"

[Eminem]
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have is, like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that
And I get tempted to—"

[Dr. West]
"Take a drink."

[Eminem]
"What?"

[Dr. West]
"Take a drink, and y'know, take the edge off."

[Eminem]
"Take the edge off? Man, if I have a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to."

[Dr. West]
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*

[Eminem]
"No, what the fuck?!"

[Dr. West/Slim Shady]
"Marshall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall? Marshall!!

[Eminem]
"Oh no, no, no! Come on, man!
Oh, fuck you, man!
No, no, no, NO!"
*Alarm beeps*
"Oh, shit!"

[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, yo, this is motherfuckin' Eminem
Dirty Dozen, 'bout to show you
How we set it when we come through
Know what I'm sayin'?
Word up, bitch-motherfuckers better raise up
Y'all motherfuckers better raise up!
Ayo, buss it! Ayo…

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm a pit bull terrier, triple darin' ya
Scarin' ya with a derringer
Ready to make you wet like a submariner
Tearin' ya frame out with homicidal lines
Bringin' the drama and the trauma to your mama's vital signs (Blaow!) A verbal shot fired, this mic's been hot wired
Uppercuts to your chin, knockin' your snot skyward
Rappers wanna be screenplay actors
So I'm givin' they spine fractures
Like linebackers from the Green Bay Packers
And roll over 'em backwards, Dirty Dozen
I'm someone you just don't wanna see, like a nerdy cousin
So keep your distance when I get this tense
You see my fist clench? It's gonna be some bullets dispensed
You best to keep your premises fenced
You missed hints, any resistance
Get you voided like misprints
You'll end up with no teeth left makin' a beef threat
When I roll up on your set
Don't get it twisted like Keith Sweat

[Hook 1: Eminem]
When I get to bustin', you best to get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin'?
That oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch, I'm comin' through dumpin'
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin'
Your blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you don't know, you best make an assumption
I got you slumpin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'

[Verse 2: Proof]
A proven fact, my pact got your whole team movin' back
We never losin' slack, I paid dues in rap
I'm runnin' till my shoes are tapped
My writers use them gats, my thugs fuse them cracks
Relax and catch a contact to an amusin' track
Slugs dispatched on any street riz and mismatch
My team'll get busy, like rednecks on some six packs
My fist crack the featherweight, my words'll never break
A clever snake'll be forever fake
Let me get this cheddar straight
Makin' dough is a part, so is the heart, my flow is the art
Me and the mic Gomez like Lois & Clark
Weapons concealed until death, now see 'em
My chrome shatter bones that lack calcium
Knockin' domes out the ballpark
Your dawgs is all bark, plus you got a small heart
Now save them corny lines for Hallmark
I want the sunny days and money paid in them figures
A microphone fiend
And on my own team there's fake niggas
Mums they rocked the cradle, I spot the fable
They made the shop and stable, with grass top the table
The Glock enable when I pop the fatal
Phonies that I plot prenatal wax
The player haters never make it back; I'm dumpin'

[Hook 1: Eminem]
When I get to bustin', you best to get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin'?
That oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch, I'm comin' through dumpin'
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin'
Your blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you don't know, you best make an assumption
I got you slumpin'
Fool, I'm comin' through dumpin'

[Verse 3: B-Flat]
Ayo, we don't say fat, we stay [scrow?] business
The third nigga on the mic, representin' [roughanopolous?]
Ain't shit stoppin' us, old school like Cold Crush
Slice and dice MC's on the mic like cold cuts
Live and direct, comin' straight from the ghet'
Where niggas keep it real and make these girls' panties wet
I can't forget the DJ, he play, we say
Funky type of shit that make the crowd wanna flip
We don't bust clips, guns is not in us
But when shit get deep it's a must that we bust
Arm, leg, leg, arm and head
Or afros and facing bald heads all way down to the dreads
40s to drink, endos we smoke
And the rims that we ride on are true, deez spokes
Tires, know a lot of Michaels, but they don't live on Myers
Bitch's pussy tight, here come the dick pliers
What's my name? Call me sire
[Real wide?] on the mic, like titty dancers on the fire
When you hear my beat, [?] live crowds jumpin'
I’m comin' through dumpin’

[Hook 2: B-Flat]
Other MC's like Doug E. Fresh ain’t sayin' nuttin’
Bitch-nigga, I'm comin' through dumpin'
Go to the church, I’ll have the dick in cold humpin'
Word up, ‘cause my shit be comin' through dumpin'

[Verse 4: Eye-Kyu]
When I'm lifted, don't quiz this, it ain't worth it to risk it
I quick with the gift, and twice as swift with the biscuit
Headed back to ship off
All these niggas' ass around Christmas
They know it's the time of year, they be expectin' my visits
Doin' 90 on the henzel, runnin' to get it
And twist you niggas like a pretzel
Blows come in three, like the Godfather trilogy
I'm Micheal Corleone with this mic
Bitch, you ain't killin' me
Let me see some hands to make sure y'all feelin' me
I'm stickin' you up for your rocks
And y'all gon' give 'em up willingly
Rap is my life, and that's why every day I live it
Punches holes in the floor, like wack rappers records
Man, ain't a nigga in here is bringin' in drama this thick
Then they time to come up shorter
Than bloods on a midgits, shit, can you dig it?!

[Hook 3: Eye Kyu]
Kyu comin' through with somethin'
Guarenteed to make your whole fuckin' block jumpin'
Comin through dumpin'
When we come, we got your knees cumblin'
Y'all niggas ain't sayin nothin', ‘cause we comin' dumpin'
What you talkin'? Nigga, get to walkin'
See your bitch-ass crew stalkin', but we gon get to dumpin'
You don't want it, while headin' back up off it
I'ma tell you how it is, nigga, ‘cause we dumpin'



[Verse 1]
Sixteen years old and completely unstoppable
I can't be dropped so I'm considered undroppable
Step my way and you must be insane
Don't come near me if you don't like pain
Suckers keep talkin' and I just about had it
This is my game and I'm the best at it
I write the rules and I'm the best in my division
I win by a knockout, never decision
Don't even try it punk, just forget to wish
Unless you like to eat fish and don't fuck with this
Silly suckers talkin' trash is one thing I can't stand
You wanna talk trash, go be a garbage man
So I treat you like garbage, throw your ass away
So you better start breaking out before you get taken out
My rhymes are like food because you always need it
But, yo, you wanna bite it punk? I'll make you eat it

[Verse 2]
Any emcee that wanna be like me
Stop wishing then come back to reality
You don't have what it takes, too many mistakes
I'm sorry to tell you but those are the breaks
With the brains of a scientist and the rhymes of a poet
Don't tell me that I'm good because I already know it
Never has there been someone with this much potential
Always pack a mic because it's simply essential
Using the microphone as a murderous weapon
Put it to my mouth cause all the suckers are steppin'
Don't try to play me out, because I'm not a game
Now I'mma see, things are gonna change
Don't ask me to battle if we have what you're losin'
Don't pick up a mic if you don't know how to use it
The mic is not a toy, and I'm not a little boy
If you're thinkin' 'bout laughin' remember
I'm the one employed
This is not a band and we're not a bunch of singers
It's Emcee Double M and DJ Butterfingers
Now because of his name, that don't mean he slips
Two is called a duo and this song is called a hit

[Verse 3]
Now just because I'm good that don't mean I'm conceited
If that's the impression you got I'm sorry you were misleaded
Whenever there's a battle, naturally I win it
It don't take but a minute 'til the sucker to fall in it
All it takes is once for you to step to me and...
Now you better pick what hospital you're gonna be in
But that's not the point, what the point I'm tryna make is
You talk behind my back and that's where your mistake is
But this song is not about you, ain't what I'm tryna say
Talkin' 'bout myself is a better subject anyway
But now it's time to say peace, we stated the facts
Double M, Butterfingers, the New Jacks



[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It seems like no matter what I do
I just can't get away from them
(Get away from what?) The voices
I can hear 'em calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers, with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time, I'm super human
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex girl
You assuming, Cupid's looming, my mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman Show, all I have is music, ho
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago, so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
But you better put a fork in it if you think I’ma lay here just spooning, yo
Oh, you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful?
Diabolical to my last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
Ever since I was 13 I learned how to sew and sewed shut my own bootyhole
'Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I’ma set this bitch on fire!
And this time I don't mean I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
'Cause this time when I fuck this world I’ma put the whole goddamn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hole yet, I'ma go get Nickel and try to rip it wider

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Shh! Did you hear that?
I thought somebody just said something
Is there anybody there?
Classical poems, battle my own demons, I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone, I'm matador prone
First time I seen a desert eagle I was letting the .44 buss, the .44 pop
The first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs, looking at Robocop
I am not a man, I'm a logo, I'm a such thang
In order to clean my veins you need Saleen, I'm never referring to the solution, I’m talking about more like the Mustang
Vroom! Get respect from the get-go, hello! Step to the echo, echo, echo
Pen got a mind of its own, got to write my rhymes with a timer
Otherwise I’ll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati, as the petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton, check your Bible inside it
It'll say this guy's an elephant, I’m fly like I’m killing the scene like
I’m a villain with wings, I’ll sleep when I’m 6 feet deep
Right now I’m living a dream, though we may be reckless
The ladies check us, they whisper Shady Records, baby echo!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo



[Intro]
All aboard!
Okay, next stop, my basement (Ha-ha)
I'll meet you down there!

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That’s a no-no, even she knows Da-Da's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking-A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen, man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters, turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest, but

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 2]
"Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots"
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, ask Doctor Dreson
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 3]
Elevator in my house, hah, smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in the microwave, I'm
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away, then I just pepper-sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hide out, drive by my house and beep
Like, now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker (bah), try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling "Stop!"

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Outro]
You fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A, even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off, I can just toss a
Flying saucer in it, the shit's awesome
Yeah, fucking elevator, living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Intro: Big Trigger]
Yea Ya'll know what it is
Rap City presents Em360
Slaughterhouse, Eminem, Big Tigg, Just Blaze!
On the 1s and 2s, oh-oh

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo Tigg, get in the not booth
And spit the truth, to the young youth

[Verse 1: Big Trigger]
Aight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards
But this Hip Hop, so don't leave home without your bars
And for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad
Cause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had
It's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth
And ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth
Yes indeed original, beats the replacement cause
The back room will never be what the basement was

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I'm the realest mo'fucker that I know
Wasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow
I do it for the love I don't do it for the dough
But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes
What's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for
And them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more
These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe
I grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe
Want to see me lose every battle of depression
No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression
They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start
Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart
I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
Was so high I lost track of my ways
Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age
The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase
How you trife when I gave you life
You was lacking in wage
You don't want say hi or speak to me
Bet you makin 200 dollars by weekly
Try to help the world out, bring some reparation
And forget being humble in a state of desperation
Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation
And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation
I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation
And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication
Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe
It would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9]
Its Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat
Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee
Best rapper alive and you know me
The most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D
I take mines at lead point
At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
Only fear I have is "world star" being yelled from my blind side
Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight
But these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license
That's plain stupid, your boy's a star
Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar
It's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car
And now it's back and forth
The black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore
And Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds
We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad
This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop
We killed the cypher two times already
What you gon' give us an award
But we won't stop for shutting down the internet
Now tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters
Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members
Waving that shady flag, navy jag
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
I'm in a crazy kind of place
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
So chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist
That'll leave kids on your baby mommas face, for real
The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules
Your cap just started snapping
My starter caps was snapping
When cross color was cracking
And my cane was half full
With the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart
Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop
You don't want it with me
If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free
So save your jabs its way better
If I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather
Yeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how (?) shook turned notebook
Broke cook, I'm so dope look
Bring the beat back with no hook just bars
Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras
Move g-strings like guitars, that's nothing, that's something light
Like Riesling at the bar
Y-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say
This like NWO vs NWA, y'all like the rockers versus the ROC
Full of nothing but Jays
Check the rocks its nothing fugaz'
But don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days
Make it horny when we out, Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Slaughter season, y'all the reason
Real dudes I'm bringing some more in
Like a Polynesian
Sick with the llama squeezing
Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing
Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne
You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing
They set you deep in your coffin sleeping
I'm gone off the deep end, I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin
I'm out here hunting with my ink pen
I'm living like a kingpin
Doing it for my g's in the pen
Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters
You looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur
You got the Wright brothers
No bright jeans, no bright colors
I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted
Islamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen
I backed you in a dodge a minute
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis
Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants
Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens
I guess that era's over man, hold on
I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'
I give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles
Before me you didn't have em'
You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam
Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time
I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script
Too many punchlines
Family I'm amongst mine
I keep the peace like a monks mind
.357 fade your favorite barber
Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara
Don't stop what we doing
When you see L.A. your team will be ruined
This game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, ooh kill em'

[Introduction: Big Trigger]
Ladies and gentlemen
Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend
Mister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo can we cut this beat off
I might need to do this acapella, yo
Role model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of coke products
If she don't swallow, and tie her to the bumper, hit the throttle
While I'm tryna hit the pot holes, I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho'll end up horizontal gettin' fondle
I don't cuddle, I don't coddle
Only motto that I follows is everything I drive, whether it's a  Navajo or a Tahoe
It's got a ho in it
Nah ho, I don't got no freaking bronco
You looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto
I got a rusty Hondo with some bondo
And a box of condoms you little blond ho
Fuck me? Fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono
And I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu
I'm intolerable, too volatile, screw it
I don't got too make the honor roll to be on a roll
I don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off, all these knock-off-me's,
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think this is part 2 to Recovery
Or to "Love the Way You Lie" part twelve
Or something heart felt, you 'bout to make a discovery
Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass
Ain't dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers, so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach
That punctured a lung punk and I'm still functioning from it
Chump it was nothing
Now watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn
Once I think of something to trump it
And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off
Like the trunk of an elephant; the triumphant
Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn
But chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Teresa, give a fuck if it's Easter, so kiss my keister
'Cause that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek for



[Spoken: Eminem]
Ayo Paul, it's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wow, well I'll show him who's really bad {*burps*}

Paul the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror
And tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough

Do you remember the time
We were watching the "Billie Jean" video?
Well, he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's black or white
Because I can't stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking die

How do you like that? And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna touch him, but I can't {*mouth noises*}
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry

Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no, I don't have a new gun
{*Gun cracks and bullets fall out*} Goddamn it!



[Skit: Eminem & GPS]
Paul, yo, um
So I got your message, I wish you would answer the fuckin' phone
Um...
(Turn right)
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like (Turn right), what people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo motherfucker, whatever the fuck his name is, said I rhy—literally said I rhymed "rhymes" with "chimes"
"Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes"
(Turn right)
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
(In 100 feet, turn left)
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid
But I swear to God this motherfucker lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now
(Turn left)
I'll hit you back later



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Peace to Thirstin Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed, with badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, starting with your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
With smeared letters, running together in blurred spurts
I hang with male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's
My first words were bleep-bleep and curse-curse
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs
Yanking out my stitches, hollering, nurse nurse
You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
And it's like that, and it's like that

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Got no apathy
Yo, I platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you here's the diff
Gun to your head, you're dead, pointblank I shapeshift
That's right to dear, anelope, or owl
In life, use your potential, or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, yo too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout
You say I use my name too much as a clutch
Try holding on to beat instead of pushing on your crutch
Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you coming
Deaf/Def like Leppards, pop the piece, I be the sheppard
Causing the herd, the name is Ev absurd
Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that
Methaphor imagery, you claiming metaphors and spitting similies
Not having it, the name is Evidence
Like Pos. K gibbin the life thinking of stabbing it
Skills prevail you possess, take no offense
But don't profess lies within your mind, tempt and stress

[Iriscience]
It's like uh-oh-oh
It's Dilated Peoples on the Wake Up Show-uh-oh
We kick a lick or some for the radio-uh-oh
Yo CaTashTrophic like Rico



Verse 1 (Eminem):
I wasn't born mean
I was pushed to treach'
I walk the streets looking for some pus' to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turning mush
I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one, 'til it's squished against me
And leave a dead body in the woods
The MC with the Christopher Reece beef
Started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made out of wood
I shouldn't
Yes I should
Ridin' through the hood
I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow
A white fellow
My pee is bright yellow
I like jello
I'm like: Hello
To a cute little dike on the mic
I'm kinda like...

Verse 2 (Kon Artis):
See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave out of class
Believe
Then I'm a mail box pimp in my heart 'til i die
Even after I'm all gone
And my ashes fry
Went from an ashy guy
To class clown is high
To a grown ass man stacking -
PayPal
Run your mouths to click
D12's the game
We been spitting this shit since we were little babies
Ga Ga GooGoo
Na Na Noo Noo
Never
Word to my homie Em'
I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot would leave ya face lopsided
The kick from the girl make you think I'm cock'ided
Bustin' off in the crowd
I start diving
Greg Louganis over the bar
I ain't lying
Hot iron lethals
Not defying the soldier
Run ya damn soldier
Equals death when it's over
There's none colder than -
The understanding struggle
Flighter street hustle
We been had to hustle
We been had to hustle
We been had to muscle
Flighter street hustle
We been had to hustle

Verse 2 (Eminem):
Yeh
Aight
Me and Westwood blasting off, jacking off
In a pair of acid wash
Bumping (?)
Cruising grass 'til I'm damned to crash the car
Tryna smash 'em off
On the dash
Hit the overpass
Went off, over the bridge
On-coming traffic
Cause a massive 42 car pile-up, Not a scratch at all
Hopped up holding an axing saw
Jason; masks is off
My face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spiting flames; kicking fire out your ass
You little bitch, You can pass it on
I'm battery acid dog, You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball
While I'm going through back withdrawals
Dick so big it's like elastic; tie it in a knot
It's looks like Mr. Fantastic crossed the path of Fantastic-Man
With a drastic force
So it's --
Put my penis on classic sports

Verse 3 (Eminem):
Once again; it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain, just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray; reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela; so I command ya to start dancin'
Part-Manson, part-Hannibal, part-mechanical-shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask; your blood stains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling "Rosie, won't you come out to play?"
Ain't no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this; so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew; and he will do, what he feels
And still can spin, straw into gold like Rumplestiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred, he's ill with it; he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MCs will get fricassee'd on the grill, then

Verse 4 (Eminem):
I have no idea what I'm doing
I have no idea what I'm doing
But
Everybody get up
Sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you
Superman issa, alive and he's flowing like the mystic river
Girl don't act like you never been kissed before
1 2 3 4
5 6 this a; rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody find me I disa-ppeared; I was hiding in 3 ways beer jissa
Hop skip and a jump coz my skin (?)
Meals into my face; that I been pushing
Hell-raiser; my face is my pin-cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a
Suck it like a vice grip
My pin put ya; in the slaughter house coz your style's been butchered
Out-spin chainsaw
Take it like the blades on; my brains on hyper-drive
Someone put the brakes on

Hook (Eminem and Kon Artis):
It's a smidget the midget to get the digits Bridget don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice; my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice; my swag juice
It's a smidget the midget to get the digits Bridget don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my
--

Verse 5 (Eminem):
... coz it gets as busy as a
Bee, baby you can throw a frisbee in the blizzard
He'll catch in his teeth
What is he?
He's a wizard
Standing in the disco with the disco-biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't this quick is it?
Now baby don't forget to bring ya lipstick with ya
I want a kiss before I blow this bitch to, smithereens
Get the guillotines; this is a stitch-up
West is a critical as Dre, spin with ya
Turn tables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Check a chick
A check a chick
A check a check a chicka
We'll wreck in a second, tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just make a little bit of breakfast it's a 6 o'clock in the morning
Does she wanna get some...


Hook (Eminem and Kon Artis):
It's a smidget the midget to get the digits Bridget don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice; my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice; my swag juice
It's a smidget the midget to get the digits Bridget don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice; my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag... my swag juice



(Intro)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my
(verse 1)
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it "Walk on Water" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!
(chorus)
Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Line 'em up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look
(verse 2)
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spit like this in his last shit"
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up"
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition
Slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot a head (pew)
Gabby Gifford, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sac-rilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is
To help you put together some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole this show
Sorry if I took forever
(chorus)
Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Ha
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy
(verse 3)
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, unleash the monster
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary
In my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of turnt you're minus
Mine says very, yours says hardly
And what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car
'Cause I'm barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Thrust my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles
The Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat
Piss and moan, but I'm not gonna fall, bitch!
It's too loud
(chorus)
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire

If I'm elected for ten terms
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural
And hiring all girls as interns
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my ass (Look!)
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawal
(Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)
The Bad and Evil movement is comin
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say
Whether it's one verse or one letter
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love



I'll shove a gun in ya grill
Greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated
While you breathing or you'll be leaving
The receiving room this evening with Jesus
You hate on us, we'll be waiting on eight corners
Swarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
I'll hop in the Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that ya mom bought you
Mess around and get choked and found in a moat
Floating around drowned face down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a pen
And we'll pull up to the seven mile drive-thru
At McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a driver out his Eddie Bauer
When it rides by me at ninety miler per hour
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows
It's like that, it's like that

Hey yo, what do you think about two grown ass men
Living together?
Alright. What do you think about another grown ass man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well those two grown ass men
Living together on my nuts
And that shits right above them

When I rhyme somehow I think I must subliminally
Throwing viagra at these fags who got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows
Nothing is off limits except for Michaels' nose!
I didn’t know, I'm so sorry please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended. Ooh!
I got it, I got it, apology for Steve Harvey too, it’s in my pocket
(Oh wait, here it is)
FUCK YOU!! Hey!
What do you say Andre whats new? Life is good man I’m chilling, 50 how 'bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, we’ll make it through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace, G-G-G-UNIT!

In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I tell a mothafuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's-her-face

Ooh yeah, girl run that game, (Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say? "Rot in Pieces," uh, that's great)
First off you don't know Marshall at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit, leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whoady, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans

Let the horns blow: Eminem has annotated selections from his entire catalog for Genius. Below are a few highlights — to see all the annotations, go to Eminem's profile page.
Eminem recalled his first studio session with Dr. Dre and the creation of "My Name Is," a song that was recorded in one take and launched him into superstardom:
Dre put on the Labi Siffre record, and I was just like “Hi! My name is!” That beat was talking to me. I was like, “Yo, this is it, this is my shot. If I don’t impress this guy, I’m going back home and I’m fucked.” I knew Dre wasn’t an easy person to please. I made sure that everything he had a beat for, I had a rhyme ready to go, or I came up with a rhyme on the spot

“My Name Is” was the first thing that came out of my mouth that first day I was at Dre’s house. I don’t know if we released what I did the first day or if I re-did it, but it was basically the same. I didn’t understand punching, or believe in it. So I would just go from the top of the song all the way down. I was never flying in hooks. Everything was live, one take. If I got all the way to the fucking end, and messed up the last word, I’d be like “Run it back, let’s do it again.” I remember Dre was like “Yo, are you fucking crazy? Let’s just punch.” I didn’t like that concept because I wasn’t used to it. When we were recording here in Detroit, in the beginning, I was saving up my money to go in. We only had an hour, you know? I’m like “One take down, alright, let’s go to the next song. Fuck it.” That’s what I was used to.Marshall explained where the name "Slim Shady" came from in an annotation on the song "Just Don't Give A Fuck":
Coming out with an alias was part of Proof’s whole idea. He said, “Let’s be in a group called D12, and there will be six of us, and we’ll each have an alias. We’ll each be two different people.” When I started rapping as Shady, as that character, it was a way for me to vent all my frustrations and just blame it on him. If anybody got mad about it, it was him that said it, you know what I’m saying? It was a way for me to be myself and say what I felt. I never wanted to go back to just rapping regular again.In another annotation on the same song, Eminem explained that he started writing songs like "Just Don't Give A Fuck" because "people were saying that I sounded like AZ and Nas."
Em broke down a few lyrics from "Lose Yourself," clarifying whose sweater the vomit was on in the first verse:
The first verse is all about Jimmy Smith Jr. It’s me talking about Jimmy Smith Jr. — like, I’m not saying my sweater, I’m saying his. I’m trying to show you what his life is about.On the original demo version of "Lose Yourself":
This is going to sound stupid, but I have no recollection of the demo version on “Shady XV.” I don’t know where I recorded it, I don’t even know when I recorded it. I did a lot of drugs, so my memory is all over the place.(Find three more annotations from Eminem on "Lose Yourself" here.)
On how the lyrics of Dido's "Thank You" helped inspire "Stan":
When I heard “your picture on my wall,” I was like “Yo, this could be about somebody who takes me too seriously.” So I knew what I was going to write about before I wrote it. A lot of times when I’m writing songs, I see visions for everything I’m writing. This was one of those.On the decision to make "In Da Club" the first single off 50 Cent's Interscope debut:
We couldn’t decide on the first single from Get Rich. It was going to be either "If I Can’t" or “In Da Club.” We were torn, so me, 50, Paul, Chris Lighty, and Jimmy Iovine decided to flip a coin.On Jay Z's "Renegade," Em explained his thought process when writing:
When I’m writing, I’m in the syllable game. I’m connecting 5-6-7-8 syllable phrases where every syllable rhymes. I get heavy into that. When I start rapping something, and I think of more syllables that connect with it, sometimes I want to just keep the scheme going forever

I’ve done it before in songs, where the syllable scheme of the first verse ends up being the syllable scheme of the second verse, and the third verse — all the way down. I do it because the lines start connecting and making sense. Once I find something and lock in, it comes out pretty quick.Marshall also annotated a fan favorite, "Sing For The Moment," explaining why he kept going despite the criticism he received early in his career:
This is where I was dealing with critics who didn’t understand why people were identifying with me. I realized I was becoming like the rappers that I looked up to as a kid. I identified with and loved LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys. I felt like if everybody didn’t understand their music, it didn’t matter — they were speaking to me. So that’s what I was trying to make people realize on this track. I may not be shit to you, but there’s a kid in fucking Nebraska, or somewhere, that I’m talking to. I don’t care if you’re listening, because he’s listening. That’s who I’m directing my material at.On "Rap God," Marshall said the only thing he would do, other than rhyme, is play for the Detroit Lions:
The hook was the first phrase I thought of when I heard the track. I thought “Okay, this has something to it and might be catchy but — I’m a “rap god”? Why? If I’m going to say that, I need to validate that.”

I don’t want to say it’s the crutch, exactly, but the theme of the whole song is: this is the only thing I know how to do. I don’t know how to do anything else, aside from play a little bit of basketball. Except if the Lions called me. I’m down to be receiver or something, or a running back. I’d be good for that.(You can read two more annotations from Eminem on "Rap God" here.)

Eminem also annotated a vintage Biggie/2Pac Freestyle from 1999, commenting on past and present MCs:
There’s people who rap to make songs, just because they enjoy doing it and want to express themselves. And then there are people who rap competitively. I believe that anybody who competitively raps — like Drake and Kendrick and Jay Z — raps to be the best rapper. People diss each other, but it’s more in the vein of “How can I kill you with record sales? Or with a flow? How can I be better than you at making records, at punchlines, metaphors, wordplay, syllables?”

But when you have two rappers like Biggie and 2Pac getting into it, you get the hip hop community torn. No one wants to see something real happen. If for a second you entertain the idea of that being entertaining, if something ever happened out of that? No. That’s not healthy.Click here to view all of Eminem's annotations on his profile page.

Slim Shady, Brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten Rhymer
Cursin' at you players than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, Fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

I gets down, rip sound, with this stick style
Pist-al, lick round, get off my dick now
Get crabbed, hostile, you kids is all sound timid
Scared to get in it, these dogs is Rockwild'
Unchained, untamed, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame, it's not a game
Just ill flows, that kills shows, you can feel yo
Kickin in you do', like a steel toe, for real doe
Y'all gon' learn, I spit germs
When you come short on Big Worm, you get burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done, and get sun
Come get some, the last vict-im, lie in a ditch

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It's still Dre Day, nigga, AK, nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How, nigga? My last album was The Chronic
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves
Still fuck with the beats, still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

[Verse 4: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up

[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
Bitch we clubbin' (nigga what?)
I'm treated like the Presidential motorcade
Takin' out the residential global persperation
Freaky gyrations close to fornication
Numbers get passed when asked information
Intoxication faded inebriated
Designated driver liver than MacGyver
Blockin' freaks in all of 'em tens
Stallions get them to pile in
Sittin' on 'Lacs bitch we write raps
Backdo' access you gettin' jealous
Standin' all in line with designer umbrellas
Bad fellas runnin' with the Eastside Connection
Any kind of club with a star check they weapons

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 6: DMX]
Yeah baby, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Punked up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause when it's on, it's on
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)
You gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 7: Ol' Dirty Bastard & Redman]
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
Yo, flipmodes, toilet bowls explode
When Doc, come drop a shitload
Grip fo's, mushrooms, did those
Dee pistol-whip hoes, a bitch owes
Money, bro I stick a zip code
Tiptoed, before Doc hit skid row
Thirsty? Sniffin out a pig nose
My Benz built with wings and 6-0's
My flows is, North Pole cold
My hands got areas to fit snow
Doc, mixin hoes and disco's
My dogs, let em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, niggas pack six rows
We're losin him! His heart won't get pulse

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

[Verse 8: LL Cool J]
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
But all you savage cats know
Y'all know me
Everybody wanna talk
Just about to jump up
Mad at me
Just a bunch of gibberish
All you savage cats know

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road



[Eminem (Sway & King Tech)]
It's like that (Uh, Eminem...Eminem)
Alright bust it (What)

[Eminem]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Gotcha locked in a cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia- while I'm standing next to ya
Eatin' a four-course meal watching you starve to death
Put a IV in ya vein feeding you liquid Darvaset
Pumpin' you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on a gunshot victim full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up by an ambulance and driven to receiving
With they asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than twenty percent chance of living
Havin' a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's lil' basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy
On you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel through the top of ya scalp
I'm pullin' ya Adam's apple out through ya mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment

[* Laughter *]



['My Name Is' plays in the background]

[Eminem:]
Paul, you're obviously not going to help me with this. I can see that. So...
Nah it's cool, don't worry about it

[Paul:]
I'm Sorry, I'm just trying to organize it

[Eminem:]
Okay, well I'm just trying to do some fucking drops that got fucked up that... Sorry

[Paul:]
Really?

[Eminem:]
Yeah

[Paul:]
Alright, well, maybe... maybe... uh... you wanna start over? What do you wanna do?

[Eminem:]
I don't know. Are. You probably haven't been listening. I think that this one is okay

[Vocal Scratching]

[Eminem:]
Good Morning! Welcome to the Shady Classics Mixtape with DJ Whoo Kid



[Kon Artis]
What is it my thang size or the way that I talk
Is it the clothes that I wear or the way that I walk
That's making you stare at me with this glare
That let's me know that you're unaware
About this Glock in my underwear
It's just another day in the life
Of me making a widow out of a wife
With a happy life
Yup, better up walk it away player
These hay-makers don't last longer than an energizer pacemaker

[Proof]
Ay-yo my name is big Proof
You know me, holla at a fast freak
That's got R-Kelly's name tated on their ass cheek
I blast heat at your feminine flow
And watch your chest leak in the street like the "Eminem Show"
What are you trying to blow guns that we've got
We're from the "D-Town"
We're bound
You shoot we get the rebound
You understand, I'll reduce your  squad
If Will Smith is Ali
Then Proof is God
[Bizarre] (Intense rubbing of nipples)
[Eminem]
Yo, honestly I don't even know if I can come after that
(Background "Yes he can")
Ay-yo In my mind I'm a fighter
My heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid
My flow sparks it right up
But arsenic writer
Author with arthritis, carpal tunnel
Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard-headed and hot-headed
Bull-headed and pig-headed
Dick-headed a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick-witted for every lyric spitted
There are 6 critics who wait for me to slip wit' it
So quick, this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I quit so stop dwelling
I am not failing you fuckers are not ready
Cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is destiny, yes money
I'm off running so get off of me
I am not slowing or softening
"No Apologies"
I ?? on this ??
(Background "Put the mic down, the cords too hot")



These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
No swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don’t care
He's a problem child
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
His fuckin' dad walkin’ out
'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let’s his emotions
Go
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away
Entertainment is changin’, interwinin' with gangsta’s
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Motherfucker they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin’ on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
Every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
Of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so I'm signin' CD's while
Police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal, and I'm a criminal how the fuck
Can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit, too, Guerrera
That was a fist that hit you
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it, too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
Checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin'
Thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it
'Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
Songs and we can
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away



Everybody, I'm Eminem. I'm right here in New York
Right now on the Shade 45
Sirius Satellite Radio station
We've got DJ Whoo Kid in the house!
And we're 'bout to get into some questions that my fans have asked and...
And one of me to explain
So uhm... one of the first questions that my fans have asked is... uhm:
"Why does Whoo Kid have so much exclusive shit?"
That was the biggest question!
Crazy lllmatic Macadoshis exclusives

[Intro]
Qasırğa öncəsi səssizlik tamamən burada
Bir dəqiqə, necə başlayırdım?
Unutdum… oh yeah

[Verse]
Bu, çox isti bir qəhvə
Bəlkə bunu Donald Trump'ın üstünə töküm? Böyük ehtimalla, yox
Amma ağlıma bomba bir hadisə mövzusu gələnə kimi əlimdə olan bu
İndi isə bir planım var və bunu göstərməliyəm
Eynilə əlində qızıldərili baltası olan bir Apachi'yəm
Bir Ramazan günündə məscidə girəcəm
Və Melanie hər danışanda bir dua edəcəm
Ağzına alac— ahh, burada dayanıram
Amma Obama'nın haqqını verməliyik
Çünki hazırda yerində nüvə savaşına səbəb ola biləcək
Bir kamikaze oturur
Və hər şey zibilə qalanda
Trump vəziyyətin sakitləşməsini gözləmək üçün təyyarəsini minəcək və qaza basacaq
Və dayanmadan uçacaq, ta ki bombalar bitənə kimi
Gerilim artdı, təzyiqlər yüksəldi
Trump, işlər qəlizləşəndə mənim qədər pulgözsən
Əlbəttə, mənə qarşı çıxmağın üçün cəsarətli bir adam olmalısan, amma elə deyilsən
Çünki səndə cəsarət falan yoxdu, boş bir ağıl xəstəxanası kimisən
Trump'ın fantastik olduğu tək şey irqçilik
Çünki ancaq bu şəkildə coşa bilir və o narıncı
Yeah, bir lənətə gəlmiş boz
Buna görə bizi bölmək istəyir
Çünki "Trump'dan qorxmuruq" həqiqətinə inanmaq istəmir
Həqiqət budur ki, biz Trump'dan qorxmuruq
Yumurta qabığında gəzməyə lənət olsun, mən qabığı qırmağa gəldim
Buna görə tez-tez "O bataqlığı qurudun!" deyə qışqırır
Çünki Trump bataqlığın içində
Sanki bir addım irəli, bir addım geri atırıq
Amma onun bu diqqət dağıtma qabiliyyəti
Ayrıca NFL komandasına hücumda bir reaksiya aldı, hamı buna diqqətini yönəltdi
Puerto Riko və Nevada silah reformasiyasına, bütün bu qorxunc şeylər haqqında danışacağına
Bezəndə Packers ilə Twitter'da hadisə törətməyi seçdi
Sonra da çıxıb vergiləri azaldacağını deyir
Bəs sonra kim ödəyəcək onun bahalı səyahətlərinin pulunu?
Ailəsiylə birlikdə qolf meydanlarından köşklərə gediş-gəliş pulunu?
Hillary'ə atdığı böhtanların hamısını özü edir
Bannon'ın dediyi şeyləri təsdiqləməkdən
Ku Klux Klan'ı dəstəkləmənə qədər..
Qaradərili olsa da, İraq'dan evinə gələcəyi üçün əlində məşəllərlə gözləyən yaxınları var
Sən isə onların Afrika'ya geri dönməli olduqlarını deyirsən
94 yaşındakı bu irqçi babanın çəngəl və xəncəri var
Bu adam bizim tariximizi və daxili faktorlarımızı görməzlikdən gəlir
Bu aralar zənci bir idmançısansa, səsi olmayanların səsi olmaq üçün
Olduğun platformanı və yerdən istifadə etmək istəyəndə sənə vələd deyirlər
Adam durub "Bizim üçün savaşan əsgərlərin üzünə tüpürürsünüz piçlər" deyir
Əlbəttə, işgəncə görüb döyülən bir əsgər deyilsənsə
Çünki onun gözündə sıfırsınız, o, savaş qəhrəmanlarının əsir alınmasını sevmir
Bu orduya qarşı hörmətsizlik deyil
Rəddolun, bu Colin üçün, yumruğunu sıx və qolunu qaldır!
Bəm-bərk sıx yumruğunu cənab fahişə Donald kimi
Yox bir, "Bütün qaçqınlardan qurtulacaq"mışıq
Yox bir, "Bu divarlardan daha böyük bir divar hörəcək"miş
Yaxşı, əgər hörsən, ümid edirəm, sərt olar
Çünki onun siyasətdə etdiyi kimi, bütün hilələrdən istifadə edirəm
Çünki divara yapışana kimi sözlərimi deyirəm, onun kimi
Və onu dəstəkləyən dinləyicilərimı deyirəm
Bu quma bir xətt çəkirəm, ya mənimləsən, ya da onunla
Və kimi çox sevdiyinə qərar verə bilmirsənsə
Kimin yanında olacağına qərar verə bilmirsənsə
Bununla işinizi asanlaşdıracam
"Sikdirin!"
Amerika'nın geri qalanı, ayağa qalx!
Ordumuzu sevirik, bütün ölkəni sevirik
Amma Trump'dan dəli kimi nifrət edirik!



[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
"He may seem as though he's plain normal" if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; "Peace and thanks"
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

[Verse 3: (Verse 1 Repeated): Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose

So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up

Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)

[Intro: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Sh-sh-sh, Shady! Aftermath! Haha!
G-G-G-G, G-Unit! Haha!

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, it’s another club banger
Got ya hangin’ on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Time’s up, game’s over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who’s got you goin’ crazy again
I’m a trend, I set one every time I’m in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you’re gone, you don’t come back
Too bad, you’re off the map now, radar can’t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin’ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin’ and moanin’, wining and bitchin’
Sit and observe, listen, you’ll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we’re on the charts with a bullet and still climbin’

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem, Dr. Dre & 50 Cent]
When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Get it crunk! Crunk! Crunk! Crunk!
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don’t gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin’ off the hinges
We ain’t showin’ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin’?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, ’cause Doc left you all guessin’
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon’ have this motherfucker hoppin’ in a second (Bump, bump!)
That’s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
’Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn’t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That’s why we came to…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
50 Cent, come on!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It’s no secret, everybody know
When Dre’s involved, there’s plenty of money involved
And plenty honey’s involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
Let’s rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre’s about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin’ out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
So never say never ’cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that a…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
We came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Yeah, haha! Still Aftermath, 2006! And don’t worry about that Detox album, it’s comin’… We gon’ make Dre do it! Haha! 50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre! We ain’t leaving, let’s go, haha! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out! Peace!
*People chanting Eminem’s name*
*Footsteps*
Oh shit! I almost forgot…
*Girl screams as Eminem pulls out a gun*
You’re coming with me!
*Eminem cocks the gun and starts shooting at the audience*
*People start to scream terrified and run*
*Gunshots and shouting*
Ha ha ha. Bye, bye!
*Eminem shoots himself*
See you in hell, fuckers



Brent Musberger: We welcome you back to Ann Arbor, Michigan and what a pleasure for Herbie and me to introduce Marshall Mathers. Some of you may know him as Eminem, but he's gonna join the Saturday night crew with our music intro starting next Saturday Night.

But folks, I wanna take you to the World Premiere of one of his new videos, called Berzerk. Take a listen, it's headed to the top of the charts.

[Berzerk video plays]

BM: Was that Rick Rubin who was helping produce that, with you Marshall, when you did that?

Eminem: Yeah, sorry. Live TV. Live TV freaks me out a little bit.

Kirk Herbstreit (KH): No!?

Eminem: Umm...yes. I'm sorry, what was the question?

BM: That was Mr. Rubin, one of the all-time greats...producer, huh?

Eminem: Yes, yes.

BM: How long does that take you to shoot a video like that? How many takes? How many hours?

Eminem: Umm...sometimes it's uh...it's usually a two day process, sometimes it could go to three. There's a lot of takes, there's a lot of sticking around waiting...But...it's cool [Herbstreit tries to interject] if the video comes out, then i guess it's worth it. You know.

KH: You wanna take it to break?

BM: Yeah...we'll take....you know...you gotta be in shape too, but stay right here with us, we're gonna kick off the 2nd half and I wanna talk about how you're gonna intro Saturday Night Football when we come back.

[commercial break]

BM: 8 EST on ABC, Marshall Mathers will open Saturday Night Football. Mathers, it's a pleasure to have you on the show.

Eminem: Absolutely, pleasure to be here. It's an honor to be able to do that. So..

KH: So you have the single out...album's coming out in November. What are you most excited about with this no album?

Eminem: Nothing.

KH: No?

Eminem: No...uhh...it'll be out Nov 5th. I'll probably be most excited to just be done with it. It's called the Marshall Mathers LP2. And..it's kind of a re-visit to the first Marshall Mathers LP...and umm...that's pretty much all i can say about it.

BM: One final question before you leave. Some of my friends in Montana wanted me to ask you. Will the Lions cover 4.5 tomorrow against Minnesota?

Eminem: Will the Lions cover 4.5?

BM: Yeah.

Eminem: Ummm...I'm not sure man...I don't ever make a prediction on the Lions cause I don't ever wanna jinx it, but I'm such a die hard Lions fan, like...to the core. So...yes, they'll win.

KH: That's all you'll say, leave it at that.

Eminem: Yeah...I'm hoping I didn't just jinx it.

BM: Here's the kickoff Marshall...just stick right here with us now. It's gonna be Wolverines ball. They've got the lead...out to the 25 yard line.

Marshall, again, it was a pleasure having you with us here tonight.

Eminem: And Brent, just how they got fantasy football or whatever. I got you on my fantasy announcer team. It would be you, of course the late great Pat Summerall and John Madden and Al Michaels. If you guys would get together and just call the game....Kirk, you're great too, much respect.

[All laugh]

KH: Not quite to that status yet, I get it!

Eminem: Right. But, you being a legend and you know, if you got with Al Michaels man and John Madden and just called ONE Lions game. The Super Bowl probably would be great this year.

KH: We'd all appreciate that wouldn't we?

Eminem: Man, that would be like a dream come true for me. You are a legend my friend. Thank you.

BM: YOU're the legend my friend! 13 Grammys, 1st rap song to win an Academy Award, an original score...Youve sold 100 million records world wide. YOU my friend are the legend.

KH: No doubt about that!

Eminem: I'm really uncomfortable right now.

[All laugh]

BM: Marshall, take care my friend. We look forward to seeing that video next week.

Eminem: Absolutely, Thank you, thank you...



[verse 1: Eminem]
Lights, action, cameras flashing
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashing
Flashing type of mic
That was unaware of trash like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axle Rose
White version of shaft pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a Mac, jet black limo
Strecth so far back you can't see the back windows
Stepping out pink hats, furs and minks
Chicks on each arm, what the fuck you think?
Right arm go that kid from N'Sync's chick on it
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and Dre at the VMA's again
Pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again

[Verse 2: Proof]
Let me show you what the clip does
Cause D12 are harder than virgins inside strip clubs
Yo, we bust thugs
You beatin us is like 20 inch doves on glove buzz
It won't happen don't take the satisfaction
With funk flex you got your back spittin'
Actin' like you harder than life
Peace to Obie Trice
Rock a mic is on the right
Obie Trice has been around the globe twice
How it feel with the shine show was
Peace to Mark Labelle, Flex and Paul Rosenburg
Yo Em Diddy save me
Ayo, I think my dad's going crazy



[Hook]
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?
They don’t want me to lie but, they don't wanna' hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!

[Verse 1]
Yeah! Problematic, I’m so problematic
That I’m probably a problem addict
Pop an aspirin cause my head is hurtin'
Hotel bedroom, missin' curtains
Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin' match
Empty bottle of Jack, I could tell I did that
I could smell it in fact, it's like death and ass
Think for a minute if I look over and look
To my left is an opened book, a Bible
To my right is a guilty conscience and her name is Brooke, my rival
At least I think her name was Brooke
She’s asleep, and I’m givin' her the lamest look
Move her hair back so that I could see your face
Cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took
About 5 minutes to get her inside the whip
Another 5 minutes to get up inside the lips
Never try really man, I really tried to slip, out
But it was just thighs and hips
OK, I was high, shit
On alchohol and the Yelawolf ego trip
Leave her lying in bed cause I don’t need no kiss
And it’s the walk of shame again!

[Hook]
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?
They don’t want me to lie but, they don't wanna' hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!

[Verse 2]
Smokin’ hot, throw it up
Keep a fifth off in my cup
Trying not to be a simp
But every time I take a sip
I think I’m gonna fall in lust
I'm back and forth like I'm packing a truck
In a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes
And a fresh fit, I’ll end up sockless
By the end of the night, flip flopping
I’ll B-Boy if you let me Hip Hop in
Alligator skin cowgirl boots only means let’s get it crockin’
That mini skirt makes any man a flirt
Manicures, animal furs and a purse
What could a little bit of smoke and Henny hurt?
You make any jerk make a penny work
Sinister with sin in her
She can leave a devil sitting in the church
On another level, not in the earth
Jessica Alba had twins at birth
Trippin' sure, piles of E, ménage-a-trois, piles of three
Waking up again, not proud of me
Yeah, I'm a lousy fiend

[Hook x2]
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?
They don’t want me to lie but, they don't wanna' hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?
They don’t want me to lie but, they don't wanna' hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!



[Intro: Obie Trice]
Yeah
Ride wit me
Come ride wit Trice, man
I brought my man wit me
Curtis Interscope Jack (ha ha)
Mr. Mathers, my nigga Fif' [Yeah]
Holla at 'em

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

[1st Verse: Obie Trice]
They say Obie Trice gone, look at em
Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?
Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs
My nigga, listen, his transitions shows his ambitions
Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing
Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher
Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures
Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches
It's hard to grasp the situation at hand
When you used to have to ask for digits
Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets
Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket
Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes
Nigga, created from the Craft, this is past fictious
Fif, tell em how we was when we last wen' visit

[Hook]

[2nd verse: Obie Trice]
And now the spotlight's on Trice
But back when the spot life was Trice
I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite
Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white
To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal
But being across the ocean is la vida loca
And vada loco, I'm in Janayo
Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel
I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil
Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill
Now how real is he to come from where we get killed
To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out
I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be
Offering me the cooch-o, eating on ossobuco
Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin
And never get to see what the world's offering

[Hook]

[Outro]
{50 Cent}
Yeah
Things change man
You know, get a chance to travel
See the world and you start to look at things a lil different
{Obie Trice}
You ain't bullshitting
Cuz I ain't never thought I'd see it out the hood
Heh, look at a nigga now



[Intro]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song
It went a little something like
"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn"
Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly-white, predominantly black. well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
"Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man, if I only had half of it"
Shit, if you only knew the half of it...
Haha

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale. I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be
So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said, Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)

[Outro]
[Gunshot]
[Crowd cheering]
Oh!
Last one, baby, let's go
Last one, baby, let's go
Detroit!



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, tryin' to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings! I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's
Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit
And whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped
For battle, sucka-duck, crawl out the back!
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)"
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, "That's sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
‘Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo."
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
‘Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother!)— Tihs! (Kill your parents!)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', "Fuck! Shit! Fuck!", adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, "Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'."
From the first album even the gals were like, "Tight lyrics!
Dreamy eyes!", but my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and
Skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Ha-ha! Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
There's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)
It controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (Evil twin), who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me (Evil twin), just blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

[Interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So, who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina!
I ain't fuckin' with either, Jessica neither:
Simpson or Alba, my album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible, read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off, tryin' to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden, it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun
At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryin' to get props for 'em
‘Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin' "Fuck the police!" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot! Look who's back
With a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez, it just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho
(Hey-ho!) I sound like I'm tryin' to sing
The fuckin' chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"? No
I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman, try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘Cause we are the same, bitch!



[Refrain: Claret Jai]
We're so furiously dangerous

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Death by lyrical injection, I kill you rappers
A lotta green with a yellow complexion
Women call me the Green Bay Packer
I pack the zero's, meaning mucho dinero
So paid, rappers is waitin’ on trades
And they all gettin' Knicked like Melo
Hello, Luda
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waste but I call it a tummy tuck
My every records jumpin', or playin' double dutch
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Let me tell this to the people not understandin' my moxy
Animal, watch me if you think it's tangible, stop me
But then I hit 'em with a flow that they can't even copy
See we don't play that where I'm from it's like fantasy hockey
Sup with the dog, thugs want a war
Bad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for
While you cuffin 'em all, I'm stuffin' her jaw
Then leave 'em for you to rebound
Kevin Love on the boards
Dog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad
I'll put you on a crash course in a Smartcar
While I'm speedin' not relyin' on the brake pad
In a car that you should only drive on a race track
So the lines about your phantoms and your Maybach
Are ghost tales of the phantom, face facts
You ruined hip-hop
Slaughterhouse will payback
Get in shape and a tatt
We done faded to black

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9"]
I went from eatin' Top Ramen to bein'
Top Rhymer, check full of commas
No regrets except for the drama
I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma
My mind a long erection
Now it's time you bow down and erect a monu-ment in my honor
Cause bitch I'm bonker, plural
In the whip with my Ivanka, pompous girls
She on E, feelin' on me, singin' on-key
While I'm bumpin', We Are the World
Got her sniffin' Britney, no he didn't did he
We run this town
No he isn't Diddy
I feel like tiltlin' the glass
She take a sip with me
She from the city of Jackson
Call her Mississippi
That was pretty witty
Your man like a Black man tryna get re-elected
He ain't gettin' diddley

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Stickin' it to the pedal, pedal to the floor
Just whippin' it through the ghetto
Metal in the door
In case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy
Referee mind state, I’m settlin' the score
I don’t know what ya’ll hatin' for
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact
I don’t know what you’re waitin' for
I ain't finna say nothin'
Turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneaker spot
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears
And his tongue in the air going na-na-na-nah-naaar
Just when you think it stop na-na-na-nah-naaar
Everything I speak is hot
Don't be mad at least everything you speak is
I can’t think of nothing nice to say, you’re not nice okay

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I'm launchin' manure
Lord of the underground, God of the sewer
On Hennessy Black, on Con-to-the-jure
Yeah, I'm off the block
This ain't work, homie I'm off the clock
I'm a syllable Hannibal killer
A cannibal with a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable
Ammo, lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West til I walk with Pac
We the 2.0 Boys, Tiz, Crook and Joe, Royce
New Ghost Rolls Royce pulled off the lot
Pop me the only way you could stop me
I'm top seed, I clock green at mach speed
So watch me if you haven't seen a phenomenon
Spit fast as Lamborghini's and Ramadan

[Refrain]

[Outro: Claret Jai]

Pack your 'ish and turn around
Because tonight we run this town
So let your feet swiftly hit the ground

Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Ew, ew, ew, ew



[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it, slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' Jay
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it "Walk on Water" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lackin' with it, "he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (pew)—Gabby Giffords
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (ha), sorry if I took forever (haha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (haha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to
Everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (woo!)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch! (yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire



[Hook: Lazie Boi]
Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only
Trying But Slowly
It Feels Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
No More

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care

You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head

A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keept making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast

[Hook]

[Outro: Lazie Boi]
Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only



[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, I know it’s been a minute, but we're back
It’s the return of the Dozen motherfuckers, let's go!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Fame
I think it’s got me goin' crazy, oh—oh—oh
I'm gettin' lost in this game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers, whoa—oh—oh
Keep speakin' my name
And then we'll have reason to hate me, ye—eh—eah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I’m goin' in

[Verse 1: Swifty]
This the life of a rocker, Jägermeister and vodka
Hopping off of the club's balcony into the crowd, surfing
And when they drop me I’m randomly socking fans
Doin' my interviews in hockey masks, slapped a journalist on her ass
I’m high off speed, driving my car at high speed
Pocket full of weed while lesbians swallow E
I'm in the studio ign'ant, my engineer gon’ call police
I feel asleep on the sound board, ain't did a song for weeks (What?)
LSD be all up in my head, giving thanks for Grateful Dead
Bussing in the air with 30 bitches up in my bed
I’m kickin’ 'em out naked and it's December
Niggas ask me why I did it, but fuck it, I can’t remember

[Chorus: Eminem]
Fame
I think it’s got me goin' crazy, oh—oh—oh
I'm gettin' lost in this game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers, whoa—oh—oh
Keep speakin' my name
And then we'll have reason to hate me, ye—eh—eah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I’m goin' in

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
Them boys are wylin’, drinkin’, cussin’ and hyper smilin’
Been ridin’ for days, tour bus look like Rikers Island
Henny, Jack Daniels, spray paintin' a die hard fan
Little Cocker Spaniel fresh outta the damn zoo
Man, you better be cautious, I’m backstage
Livin' it up with a couple of sluts feeling nauseous
From drinkin', it’s been a couple of days since I’ve slept
My dick is sore from fuckin', when I bust there’s nothing left, just dust
Back on the stage, gimme my microphone
Scrapping with the audience while we perform hyper songs
Our label presented us with a plaque
Brought it on stage and bash it to pieces with aluminium bats, thanks!
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause?
Yeah, I said my dick is sore, but I ain't say shit about my balls
(Last call) Then we off to the next city
Whatever I didn’t drink on my rider, bag it up and take the rest with me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Fame
I think it’s got me goin' crazy, oh—oh—oh
I'm gettin' lost in this game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers, whoa—oh—oh
Keep speakin' my name
And then we'll have reason to hate me, ye—eh—eah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I’m goin' in

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, this game has got me goin' crazy
Fuck it, I am crazy, what's new?
What kind of fuckin' glue you think I’d be if I was glue?
We lost Proof, he was our group's glue but where was you
When we were falling apart? You were shittin' on us too
But no one but us knew we were beefing 'cause that's what happens
When you beef with crew, it stays in your crew 'cause it's just crew
But we're back now, yeah, we took our time but in one crew
Only thing we're in a hurry for now is to rush you
And we're back to say shit you don't got the guts or the nuts too
Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
Achoo, bless you, I’m allergic to pussy
Sluts too, yeah, you think you’re the shit 'til we flush you
Had some bullshit to readjust to
Now there's just a few of us left, but it’d be unjust to rob us our just due
So rest in peace to Bugz and Proof, this one's for you homies, we love you
But we can’t stop now, we'd have too much of our blood drew from this...

[Chorus: Eminem]
Fame
I think it’s got me goin' crazy, oh—oh—oh
I'm gettin' lost in this game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers, whoa—oh—oh
Keep speakin' my name
And then we'll have reason to hate me, ye—eh—eah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I’m goin' in

[Outro: DJ Young Mase]
It's the Return of the Dozen Volume Number Two. I go by the name of DJ Young Mase. Welcome back. Swifty McVay, Kon Artis, Kuniva, Bizarre, Marshall Mathers, Big Proof the mayor forever, and Fuzz Scoota. Let's go!

[Sample: Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey)]
"You little scumbag! I got your name! I got your ass! You will not laugh! You will not cry! Now get up! Get on your feet!"



[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, first verse, uh, I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, or kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him outta his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80s
My 90s was like the Navy, you was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' "Ice Ice Baby"
Screaming, "Shady 'til I die!"
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
‘Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really, I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's "back" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
‘Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‘Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, I'ma live this—

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says
"I'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian" (C'mon)
Go back and forth and, more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
My tenement chimney now, the semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity—

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (*ptt*), and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Yeah, little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to dr-dr-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'ma have to take it

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
And then after takin' that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away
On top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire, off the top, might wanna back up data
Rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
That these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl? I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin' with a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Outro]
Pedal to the metal
Pedal to the metal

[Intro]

Sample from Batman
To the Batmobile, let's go

Yo', Manix man, I'mma take this one kinda slow, alright?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Welcome to the flipside
Hope he can swim, cause if he can't, he gonna drown on a rip tide
It's pourin', plus the old man ain't snoring
Cause he gotta get up pretty damn early in the morning
Cause I'm slammin' like Basketball Jones
Slippin' out chrome and messin' with the break bone
You suckers disgust me like low fat
Gimme' a bat and I'll show you where your head's at
Tryna' hit the row with the paddles you little boce?
I think you better stay home and eat your broccoli
Cause you still got a long ways to go
So you better step off cause you picked the wrong Joe
You ain't ready to throw with the mighty man
And don't forget about the rest of the band
So you better get used to the shrine
Cause I'll be rappin' as long as I can write rhymes
These palms'll make a cup like pottery
To make you see so many stars, you'd think you studyin' astrology
You wanted to live so tell about what you went through
You couldn't cut the mustard if I gave you a Ginsu

[DJ Buttafingaz scratching]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quickly, step to the side cause I'm coming through
You think you was looking to call me W or double-you?
So how could you think you outdid me
While I'm still gettin' getaways quicker than a kidney
Steppin' to a rabbit is stupid when you're a turtle
Did you know you couldn't even blow a rhyme in a circle
You little kiddies are getting a bit too frolicky
Throwing me rhymes more sorry than an apology
Testing the talking device [  ] please
Let me give it the proper operation that it needs
To allow me to put a end to weak melody
Need it for suckers like peanut butter and celery
Friends in the zone with the words that I kick with ease
And you with the face that feel like a Pekinese
And [   ]
My ma ha' more tooth than a sharp pair of shears
And given that, I could love to chop to it
You remember the day you rhymes with the fools
Then you'll know what it's like to take a nosedive
Beat by the fattest skinny kid alive!

[Break: Eminem]
A'ight, we're gonna break it down for a second, and I'mma catch my breath
And I'mma let Buttafingaz go off on a scratch for a minute
Dude, Buttafingaz, when I give you the cue; come up with that funkyassdiculous-dope scratch
Go for it

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, let me show you how the big boys play
Thinking 'bout us bustin' out into the fat girl on a Wednesday
While I grab the steel and put you through an ordeal
So kneel before me or fear who's more real
Imma the best mom, I'm gonna get a plat
Start flowin' so much, I'll be in need of a maxipad
It went so fast, my pen'll yell at me
Did so many drugs, my song will be a felony
How'd he ever get the nerve to confront me
Well shit, that's what you get for being clumsy
Get more steppin' up, figure the competition
I got more jerks in my basement than you have twitches
Hope you all get played out like Batman
Work like pay dirt and bust by the Fatman
And I take no bull like a [  ]
Blowin' em out so fast, I swear they make me report this
Smooth as whipped cream and rough as a callous
Back to all my [ ], and he call me Mr. Mathers
With a soul intent for destruction
One more hit for the Downstairs Productions

[Outro]
The fattest skinny kid alive! x4



[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin' like Boone's Farm
Hidin' under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
Kunivin' Kon Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach, screamin', "Let's get it on!"
A lush that love to drink, drunk-drivin' a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin' your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
You know why my hands are so numb? (No?)
'Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum
(Oh) Smacked this whore for talkin' crap
So what if she's handicapped?
The bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin' hate you, I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (Hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song, eatin' a hot dog
Readin' the Holy Qu'ran while I'm on the john
Tired of wearin' this yellow thong
Take it back, Sisqo, you know where it belongs
Now, here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs!

[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid

[Verse 3: Proof]
Just bring who you gon' bring on
Who you gon' swing on
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom-come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen M16's, one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you runnin' out this fuckin' club in your drawers
We lovin' the brawls; there's nothin' to applaud
But fuck it, it's all good
The hood is up in us all; it's fight music

[Verse 4: Swifty McVay]
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again with swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back
Right in front of the precinct (You hear that?)
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin'
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers
And made them drop his coffin; it's fight music

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
These beads I'm swingin' is stingin' them
See all these niggas?
When I step in the club I'm bringin' them
If any nigga lookin' too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Malice Greening them
And gasolinin' them with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em, or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right-hookin', right when your wife's lookin'
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing-your-life music

[Verse 6: Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces, and you Nazis
Watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed and you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' them go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called—

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Eminem Verse 1]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in it's most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless, most
Hardest, most honest known artist, chip off the old block, but ol' Doc is, {back}, looks like
Batman brought his own Robin, oh God, Sadam's got his own Laden, with his own private plane, his
Own pilot, set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges, oranges, peach, pears, plums
Syringes, {vnn vnn}, yeah here I come, i'm inches, away from you, dear fear none, hip-hop is in
A state of 911, so

[obie trice verse 2]
Niggas, I'm still grinding, (yeah...)
I'm still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's mine and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, (for sure...)
And I can't let y'all derail me man
I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man...)
We got them craps going on
And that yak going on
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin'
It's whateva, put that on the chedda man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Ivene time
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out
This is it my nigga, this what we boast about
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth

[eminem verse 3]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

Blocka, blocka, bitch you better blocka
Muy blanca, the one you call cracka

Hacked up your shit and get the fuck out the way
This is fight music, I could go for days
And I got a gay gun that go both ways
[?] kicking your face in, never jam yo
If you into what I'm into we could play around and Rambo
Suited up in camo, I just loaded the ammo
Automatic, touchy, kill the whole back row
Smashing the glasses, [?] out on the weapon
To the point I'm not livin' but I'll be back in a minute
They want me off the streets, they want me pyscho and committed
And the cops know I did it, they just want me to admit it
Halon spit it, just cut to the chase
I make shit to fight to, to break his fucking face

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
I got the poker face on, but is this poker nah
I'm letting my fists go on y'all till someone get a broken jaw
Got these bitches hoping I don't swing harder than my potent rhymes
'Cause if I do then damn it might as well call the fight over now
I kick the illest and realest shit to make you wanna straight slap a bitch
Make me wanna "clack" and compromise the fact I'm catholic
Give 'em two scoops of bravery mixed with a [?] clip
A cup of loud, drunk talkers, short fuse, not [?] shit
And two minutes later you get a riot bigger than L.A's
All I gotta do is perform one time and bitch hell's raised
I'm well raised but I disrespect any bitch that don't come correct
So if she don't wanna get decked, she better help me with this Tech
I'm 'bout to shoot up the whole function
Anybody who don't wanna get it, better be my accomplice
If you don't wanna bump heads, you better help me go fight
This tha Product motherfucker, AKA Ms. Snow White

[Chorus: Eminem]

Fucks fat ass {*cough*} nasty dirty niggas, uhhh
FILTH, shit! Fuckin filth! Yeahh
LA LA LA, la la la la, la LA!

[Proof]
Aiyyo - my style bust holes in the earth, crush the crust
By the dirtiest, heathen specialize in stoppin breathin
My legion'll bleed man - what do you believe in?
(Heaven and Hell) Make your grill swell, it ain't hard to tell
I work spells, all wicked like Gargamel
Put (?) hand first, the red bursts another victim

[Bizarre] Nah man, let the morgue pick 'em

[Eminem]
Cancel the hash shit, I'm fillin my glands full of acid
Two hands full of ass dancin with Angela Bassett
Make plans for the casket, your head lands in a basket
A dead man's in the plastic, I got red hands and the mask fits
(Yeahhh Em) Fuckin rap pervert, I serve dirt
My sick thoughts get all mixed up like rainbow sherbert
Get every nerve hurt - spot a mic and walk toward it
My whole click'll beat yo' fuckin ass and camcord it

[Bizarre]
Somebody hide me, too many hoes on my dick
Smoked all your "Hay," who wants to start the Crucial Conflict?
I'm the big daddy smokin blunts in Cali
Ill enough to do a driveby on a stay in school rally
Stop stop knockin cause ain't nobody there
Hoes with AIDS - I still fuck BARE!
Cause I, I just don't care
Ill enough to fuck up, all yo' dental care
When Bizarre kid comes through, you better yell mayday
While you was havin "Good Times," I +dyno-mite+ Kujo and J.J

[Kon Artis]
HAHA, yeah yeah bitch!
I get helmet from stank crackheads
And read my kids horror stories when I lay 'em to bed
Ridin bikes butt-naked, gettin frisked by policemen
FUCK Christmas - this is take your gift season
Beatin kids up for no reason, take lunch boxes and all
Gettin high off mushrooms and play, "A Friendly Game of Dodgeball"

BITCH! YEAH! Aiyyo..

You're battlin the Dirty Dozen, that don't pay
You god damn right punk, stay outta my way



[Intro]
16 on Death Row, Death Row
That's where mothafuckas is endin' up
16 on Death Row

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter ‘cause I'm dying, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society
That doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book
That mothafucka never cared for me
He's only here to be sure I don't drop a dime to God
About the crimes he's committin' on the poor
And how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers, and in all these years
They ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
‘Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I would've known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin' for the chair

[Hook]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit; spray 'em, 50!
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring 2Pac and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem
You staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryin' to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top; what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, ‘cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
You now about to witness the power

[Hook]
16 on Death Row
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze

[Bridge: 2Pac]
I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little bird? He snitched and told a friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old-timers
And fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners

[Outro]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row



*People chanting Eminem*

*Eminem tears up a paper*

*Footsteps*

*Door open and slam shut*

*More footsteps*

[Spoken: Slim Shady]
I almost forgot
You're comin' with me

*Gun cocking*

Last one baby, let's go
Last one baby, let's go
Last one baby, let's go

*Eminem sighs*



[Verse 1]
Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all's I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, 'cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
It's a balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
But the crowds, they're screaming
And The Palace sold out this evening
But now it's lay me down to sleep
And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Verse 2]
So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals I’m so vain I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don’t know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Bridge]
And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

[Verse 3]
I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time
When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I—

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Outro]
But I keep walkin' the line...



[Paul Rosenberg]
First Word, Excrement

[Eminem]
Exclimate, is that what you said?
My next defense, against these extra men
Who try to step to me and wanna have sex again

[Vaseline]

[Eminem]
You little sickass, I'll spray em with gasoline
They try to jack me off with Vaseline
My ass is mean, I smash your spleen
When I crash the scene

[Cell Phone]

[Eminem]
With a cell phone, now who the hell is home?
Y'all can't tell Paul how to throw me words

[Animal Crackers]

[Eminem]
Cause animal crackers is what I do when I eat MC's like a cannibal backwards
Ha ha, I got it, that's not it
Fake rappers been spotted

[Broken Headphones]

[Eminem]
Like broken headphones, you head home, you sped home
You get your head blown, rappers try to step, they speak in the dead tones
So I ain't trying to hear them, give me another, word for your mother

[Stretch Armstrong]

[Eminem]
Stretch Armstrong, my brother, coming with rhymes every time that I be drumming
Running with this shit when I kick a bitch in the stomach
And star wars, this car's a Taurus
Yo, how many bars we hit tonight, cause I'm drunk off

[Peanut Butter]

[Eminem]
Off peanut butter, you see my dick and you start to stutter
Start to utter, words that you shouldn't utter

[Mark Whalberg]

[Eminem]
Cause Mark Whalberg is a small turd, and I'mma step on him like dogshit
A fore fist, so rappers just get off it, I come across with

[Pulp Fiction]

[Eminem]
With pulp fiction, yo I'll eat you like a big gulp addiction
Like slurpees, got herpes, got a hair piece, rest my anises(?)
Got brain damage, I'm dumber than rain man is
There's mayonnaise on this, I need a plain sandwich
Hurry up, give me one, rappers try to step to this static they wanna give me none

[Fresh vegetables]

[Eminem]
With fresh vegetables, my testicles are hanging off to the left of you
You're bisexual, and there's a guy next to you, standing, rappers know that I
Be-

[Preparation H]

[Eminem]
Preparation H, you didn't even let me finish my rhyme
Just shut up for one more time, while I just shine, on this
Microphone, cause I'mma be honest, any MC who tries to step to this
I'm making you a promise, that what? Give me a word

[Nostradamus]

[Eminem]
That Nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas
And coming back to get your parents, well I have it
These rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold
Rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole

[Times Square]

[Eminem]
In Times Square, I got blonde hair, I'm higher than con air
Rappers don't want to see me, I'll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare
In a lawn chair, cause I'm there

[Kurt Russell]

[Eminem]
With Kurt Russell, saying "come here Goldie, you want my love muscle?"
I know you want it, I get blunted, then I
Kick these, freestyles just like whipped knees

[Taxicab]

[Eminem]
With a taxicab, I'll smack a bitch with a maxi pad
Where we going? Don't ask me dad
Leave me alone, I'm not trying, to even hear you
Dad, I hope you're fucking dying, off this porno mag
Yo, did you see my ad? Yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?
Is what I meant to say, I meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
For the century, Slim Shady's is gonna be the illest

[Flamingos]

[Eminem]
What? Flamingos? My mother goes out and plays bingo
Every single day, at the bingo hall, that's why my dick is single, small
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?

[DT's fired]

[Eminem]
But DT's fired, he's retired, he's not hired, yo plus I'm tired
Of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop, I'm on top
Taking records to the pawnshop, stretch
Damn, see my big ick? Catch
Put a D in front of it, rappers don't want none of it
Coming with a ton of shit to spill, Slim Shady out, I get ill with the skill
Baby, aight baby, Slim Shady
Kick eighty million rhymes, till I'm older than Grady
Spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
Bye bye



[Intro]
Slim Shady
Drop tight
Dirty Doz'

[Hook]
Tell me it feel to get tall about the frame
All you gotta do is step up and say your name
You can drop tight, all it takes is one look
Since you gon' get fucked around and get your shit took

[Verse 1: Bareda]
I told you bitch niggas a week ago
Witness these slugs as they riddle through your vehicle
Bet three or four hit yo' torso and shake yo' middle
Verbal abuse gon' have you suffering in a hospital
You bitches brittle, you too fragile to be talking shit, fuck you!
I feel sorry for who you walking with
I start to hit anything moving, I'm out my mind, it's been proven
Hit the stage and watch your rap career get ruined
And what you doing will get you stiff, watch you start to freeze
Take ya niggas out this bitch like heart disease
Start to squeeze to the point you can't regain conscious
Talking 'bout "I could've gotten" but that's plain nonsense like Magic Johnson
You just playing like you sip liquor
See, I got rabies, you might have a little bitch in ya, but yo ain't crazy
I'm the one that keep the facts known
Fuck your rap career, cause all that's gone!
You better have something to fall back on
I hear 'em saying that's wrong how I'm doing
I'm running straight through 'em and fuck up anyone who know him, damn shame one have to do em
It's now official, it's been confirmed we gon return when slugs hit you
Niggas wonderin' where you dissipate to
What you expect? While I'm getting respect, niggas is paying you your respects
Outranked niggas from the East and West, I can't be touched
Tell you what, you gon' get your best
Watch 'em get crushed!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season
My phenomenal legion will shoot out
Your fuckin' abdominal region
Slim Shady, responsible for your permanent stillness
Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness
Itchin' to rip your fuckin' frame out
Cuz I ain't got nothing to lose
Like that movie that just came out
Callin' your name out, first, last and your middle initial
Your mom, your dad, and your pregnant widow will miss you
And anybody else poppin' some shit'll go with you
Cuz I ain't tryna hear it like a political issue
So until I can leave with enough funds
I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones
Drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay & Eminem]
Watch these niggas keep grabbing like Ondre
No defeating me like Barry Sanders running back lines
Seeing you beating me, I get shit on a sleep tip
Blast him with this heat bitch
Bucking niggas up like bad traps, they got the Freaknik
I'm killing 'em
In my city, I'm considered the only rapper that can split yo gizzard
That city one
(I'm colder than blizzards
Many run, but don't escape)
Vocally you've been raped, hiding bodies in other states
If you ain't been arbitrary, rolling thicker than dictionaries
Every word would carry horror to make you wary
(Call the motherfucking 5-0)
Hurry, cause nines blow in the hands of niggas living scurry and psycho
I'm like nitro, blowing up spots with top flight post
Folding them knots so you get popped if you bite flows
You instantly turn red if wearing white clothes
Automatic slugs are given, so you gas pose
You're exposed, you laughing still while it's on
Watch your head get popped like daffodils, then you gone
(You see, 'cause rabies run rampant like mad rabbits, relentless
Rabid raps, you better run out and go get your tetanus)
Or feel the redness, red dot between your retinas
(Leaving you headless, before you even said what your set was
Ready to detonate
Pissed off and I'm blowing up like I pulled into a gas station and backed into a pump
I've been through enough, I'm looking to start a gunfight with trump tight
Dropping you off at a dumpsite)

[Interlude: Bareda]
Slim Shady
Mr. Wrong
Swifty, baby

[Verse 4: Bareda & Swifty McVay]
I barely relent like cigarettes
I drop bombs and leave you niggas mixing ligaments
These shotguns got rhymes that get on
Stray bullets been known to fuck up a happy home in the hands of Mr. Wrong
(These niggas drop like atomic bombs
Bionic rhymes from the top will stop motherfuckers from staying calm
As these firearms disconnect, your final song, bitches over with
The rap of Swift and Mr. Wrong got yo soldiers hit with the rage of Dobermans or your coldest pitbull
Niggas got no defense 'cause you niggas gon' need chiropractors, we biohazardous
I'm flipping you backwards with this gauge
Watch me cancel this)



[Chorus]
In the kitchen (putting work)
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen (let's go)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Said I'm here for money making, I've done lost 'bout all my patience
Beat almost all my cases, thought I'd covered up all my bases
Bitches try to play you till somehow, some way you figure it out
You fuck with Jay Z's bitch from back in the day you might end up with reasonable doubt
You fuck with grimy bitches standing over you taking pictures
While you sleeping, 'cause you passed out drunk after having a threesome
That will give you a reason, to trust no bitch, quit rappin'
And just go get it crackin' (in the kitchen) 'Bout to push that
White instead of that music, seems like simpler profit, 'cause nigga's gossipin'
Like they WorldStar, M.T.O, Bossip, until I find you and empty your pockets
If 5'9" stop rhyming, I'm driving on I-95
Or I am (in the kitchen) I will cop a key and put it

[Chorus]
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Can't tell y'all
If I did drugs or if they did me, nah, we was just doin' each other
We were side by side like e'ryday, didn't care if we ruined each other
Back then it was so real, fully automatic, it was overkill
I was on weed, I was on dust, might'a tried coke when I was on pills
My pockets had rabbit ears, my mind gone, wasn't on bills
Whole fam'ly disappointed in me, can't imagine how that made my mom feel
Her one's missin', guns hidden, sorry Momma, your son's trippin'
Got baggies scattered (in the kitchen)
Plus, plus you and Dad was' on the same road, y'all just left, made it right
If I ain't learn I'd do the same, pour some liquor, say goodnight
Now I'm on this music shit, tryna get this paper right
If not I'll be back (in the kitchen)

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Let me get it now
On Twitter, they murder my mentions, 'cause they heard
I was served by a circle of henchmen, layin' in a dirty ditch, that bullshit is further than fiction
They personal mission's worse than snitchin', to any person that listen
Now I wanna kill a hater, a middle finger by the 'fridgerator, flip a bird in the kitchen
'Cause DJ Vlad, he was glad bullets went into me
Just to get traffic for his site, should'a did him like MMG (faggot)
But instead I called up Sway and we cleared that up on MTV
And now I'm back (in the kitchen), but should I be?
'Cause I heard that Slaughterhouse is about to cop that Shady deal
I'm out here chasin' that paper still, push kush, coke and crazy pills
Me being shot online didn't stop my grind, nigga, I don't mind
And if I don't rhyme (I'm in the kitchen), I will cop a key and put it

[Chorus]
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Just when a nigga thought it couldn't get worse
The hearse reversed; scooped my cuz up after grandma left Earth
That recent shit, I was a young and bummy piece of shit, cursed
No decent kicks cause mom kept enough of that snow to ski in her purse
No father, Jux passed me my first gun, revolver
With the serial carved up, Real showed me my first jump, I'm a barber
Shaving the crack, after weighing the crack
An then placing the crack in 12 12's
I ain't play with the crack, I was making up stacks
All day I just sat (in the kitchen), bringing it back
Now I'm tryna do my thing with this rap
Hope this works, trying to flip words so my homies
Ain't gotta flip birds On the curb
Then black on a yellow belly coward homie feel like Pittsburgh
Lord I thank you, for making me able to find my way through
If not I be back at my momma's table (in the kitchen)

[Chorus]
In the kitchen (putting work)
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird
In the kitchen



[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
And ain't nothing in the way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die today
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
And there's nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging offa my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothing boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leaving you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands
It's Play-Doh, I ain't back to play, though
They say he died in a fatal car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup
Inside your crackers, I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin'
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at, when

[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
And ain't nothing in the way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die today
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
And there's nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I took a hiatus, haters now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
I'm the *Explosion*, you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you, you're soft
I use fire to cool me off
I told them I would grow up one day and show them
I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw them
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowing
Yes I'm living the dream homie, can't nothing compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in mid air, I’m loving it yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me now I'm slapping them back hey, fuck it
We're slap happy, yeah okay, now I'm talking some smack, aye
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight, what the track say?

[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy

[Intro - Obie talking]
Yeah! (*echo*), uh
Let y'all niggas know me
Yeah, (WOO!)

[Verse 1]
Eleven, fourteen, seventy-seven a nigga entered
Big lips, popped out placenta
Mom ain't breast feed, had no pop neither
Pop leaves shit but a name - Obie
Elementary homie that's how it started
In garbage, retarded, gainin that heart
Fuck niggas, claimin they hard, a nigga come home touched
My motherfuckin momma bangin me harder
"Nigga take your ass out their and fight them tomorrow"
That's what she told me, "little punk, blame that on your father"
So I had no choice, nigga pick up a brick
Split a motherfucker's shit for tryin to fuck with the kid
Get a little older, hair on my dick, now I'm curious
Niggas on the corner getting money, rockin jewelry
Allowance, nigga that ain't man shit
Cowardice, nigga that ain't man shit
I had to prove to myself
How these niggas same age as me calculatin this wealth
So I got me a clique and niggas what?
Workin one sixteenth, like "nigga we can clean up"

[Hook] - 2X
Follow my life, homie from start 'til now
Only my motherfuckin momma nigga holds me down
And Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through
I speak through her, straight to you motherfuckers

[Skit - Obie talking]
Two for one, here, here take this, two for one
Quit switching dicks, holla at me, see you fuck with

Summer '94, I'm gettin a little dough
Taller than my momma, so I'm listenin to her nose
I'm listenin to them hoes scream "O!"
And I'm listenin to them O's go CHOP! (*echo*)
P-Funk, Joe and me pumpin on the block, summertime

Throw a extra bump bringin cline
I'm so involved with the grind, I'm losin my mind
Fuck a steady job, I'm tryin
I steady mob, I'm dyin in this game, I ain't lyin
Sellin so much coke forgettin it's a crime
Flyin down I-75, pocket full of dimes
Give a fuck about the radar on me (*police sirens*)
Bumpin +Big Poppa+ nigga who tryin me?

[Skit] (*Notorious B.I.G.'s +Big Poppa+ plays in background*)
(Cop) - Get off the god damn truck!

[Hook] - 2X
Follow my life, homie from start 'til now

[Outro - Obie talking] (*echo*)
Yeah, all my of life
Only my momma know
Obie .. Obie Trice .. Shady and it's crazy, motherfuckers



Yo yo yo

My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (Here)
Two dudes ran up, jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him and bit him
He came back with six or seven dudes screaming "Get him!"
I grabbed one, lit him on fire, pinned and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept droppin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' in the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)



[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever—first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown—Nino
She insist she got more class—we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me—Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled—chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal—I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness—bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money; Benjamin Button "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world, like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me, when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me – no, you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class: Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello—it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top!"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go—packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go—Macadamian—they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow—fuck no!
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over—oh, no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth-fillings
Come flyin' up outta our mouths—now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you got at me—how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake—

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man



[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio
And it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, "Motherfuck the police!"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

[Hook: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs
Tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

[Hook: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

[Hook: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Outro: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre



[Verse]
I found myself standing there at the crossroads
How I got here nobody knows
But a storm is brewin' and the time is comin'
I can feel my mind race to the line I'm runnin'
You're there but I ain't scared
Got my wits about me and I've come prepared
With my pen in my hand I got my master plan
Cause if I get this all down I got the upper hand
I see you, the dark side of me
Every day trynna' take the best of me
Every way fightin' with the rest of me
And if I let you be you'll be the death of me
But fuck that, I ain't havin' that
Cause this is my life, I'm gonna take it back
I spent too many years in this circus act
Now I'm ready to fight, you gotta face the fact that

[Chorus]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk
Like they've got somethin' to say but nothin' comes out
When they move their lips, it's just a bunch of gibberish
The motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk
Like they've got somethin' to say but nothin' comes out
When they move their lips, it's just a bunch of gibberish
The motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre



[Verse 1]
Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 2]
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 3]
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For [edited] eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see ...

[Chorus]
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed



[Intro x2: Eminem]
All the ugly people be quiet

[Interlude Royce Da 5'9"]
Wave (x7)

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" & Eminem]
I got a house full of bitches, niggas, it is going down
I’mma hold my own, yeah
Bitches laying on the floor like it’s a crack house
Welcome to the frat house
Condoms, kegs, liquor, weed, pills
I’mma hold my own, yeah
Bitches laying on the floor like it’s a crack house
Welcome to the frat house

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
Your lady’s on my dick, you’ll probably be mad
If you find out I had her skipping biology class
You got comedy cash
I’m a quarter of the Slaughter, half of the dream team, the anomaly Bad
We here to riot the scene
Quiet your entire college up, tie up your dean
My Q-Dog’s on that step shit
I’m 'bout to send a text to my next ex-bitch
Have you on pills, on 'shrooms
Have you feeling like oh-la-la-laa
Now it’s sounding like Lauryn Hill’s in your dorm room
Spit at me wrong, get hit with my new llama
It’ll knock him out his shoes
Dropping more niggas then who dropping out of school
Slaughterhouse gang, streamers, confetti
The squeamish had better get ready, because

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
LBC, we them beach boys
We don’t need your education, we Pink Floyd
I'm getting destroyed
I’m getting oral from a Maury sexy decoy; she on that E boy
She paying tuition with webcam's and PayPal
School in L.A. but she say she from 8 Mile
Her pussy hotter than a chili pepper
I tell her lay down and give it away give it away now
Later on, she’ll be wearing my Letterman jacket
Reach in your pocket (Mollies) medicine packet
Let 'em attack it cause that’s my regular tactic
‘Cuz that’s what let’em get active, whoever said I’m romantic
Is wrong, hope you got a powerful chin
Cause they say blowjobs are flowers for men
I’mma need about a dozen, go get your guzzling cousins
And your trouser arousers, we wilding again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden and (Joell Ortiz)]
See I’m an on-stage rock star
(Backstage porn star)
Gave my laptop (Then I threw her on the armoire)
Make it red storm when that Saint John in you
(Brain in the college in Philly, call that Temple
I like a really huge ass)
Bend over, take her to church now she in U-Mass
Scoop my Spelman broad for all out sex
Show her 12 bedrooms, still there’s more house left
(Titty in my left hand
Drunk as a freshman on his tenth keg stand)
Got a sophomore, all jaw, give me drunk head
Roommate joined in, climbing down from the bunk bed
(Yeah) Matter of fact (No)
(Yo, I am so... throwed)
This pill gave me a new demeanor
(Chris Reeves graduated, I’m a super senior)

[Hook]



Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: Eminem]
You say I'm cold to the touch
Coulda told you this much
As I go for the gusto bending you over the hutch
But you're ready to spread
Can't tell if you're squirting

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My music is soothing but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump out your car while it's moving
You been waiting on this moment, my sermon is like a omen
I'm serving, I'm Erick Sermon, I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book, go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage and find something
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumping
I'm constantly copping over you, squatting, shit has gotten
To the point where I ain't even writing no more, I'm just jotting
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickening, I've been kicking ass
Off bullshit throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Canibus?
Then it's Dre's fee, if you Kay Slay, the fees waved
I stay beefing with JD, 'til the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazing him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape and the tape leaked
"Say What You Say," motherfucka
Drama King, Kay Slay, motherfucka
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucka
Xzibit, blaze this little gay midget cocksucker



[Sound effect: gunshot]

[EMINEM]

I’m a kick it
The motherfuckin’ liquid
That I be spittin’
Infinite ammunition
Yeah you wishin’
You try to step to this but you died
You tried to fuck with my style but get denied
And get hit
And get pushed back to the fuckin lab
When I stab you in the abdomen
When I grab a pen and jab it in

[EMINEM begins CANIBUS impression]

Travelin like an abdomen and gag you with it
Javelin when I’m stabbing it and grabbin it
With the Canibus animal animus
Element jam it is
Whatever lattice magnanimous
And the shadow is adamant
The equilibrium will lay on top of these mathematics
In alphabetical order, Destroyer!



[Eminem freestyling]

Die Bitches, Check it out bitches
All you bitch ass rappers
Need to get your clit repierced, Look at me, hip, I'm Britney Spears
Look at the way I wear my mascara
How you doing
I'm Pristina Gaguilera, And I sing songs about a genie in a bottle
And I'm Britney Spears
I got big tits, I'm a role model
To all little kids
But I got breast implants
That was the only way to get my chest enhanced
And here I go with the lyrical, miracle, spiritual everytime im incredible
With freestyles from the top that I drop
And my instinct
Is to kill N'Sync
And the Backstreet Boys
It really doesn't matter coz' I got a scratchy voice
Yo, check it out
But you ask me I ain't gonna be happy til' I see every member of the Backstreet Boys
Getting their ass beat
In the back seat of a taxi, And dropped of on the real backstreet
And somebody black sees five little rich white boys
Looking like faggots
With the N painted on the back of their jackets

[Proof]

Ohhhhh
And god damn it
Can't stop there
What's up?
It's over
And this just Some Bacardi and Mountain Dew

[Eminem]

And wonder how we tune is
Ten million



{Freestyle over Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto'}

[Intro: Eminem (Proof)]
Yeah. Now I'm getting distorted. (Can you turn it down) When I was...I should've been aborted. But it was too late...uh oh. (Uh oh) Yo, just turn up the beat a little bit. I don't care if the mic is distorted. Fuck it

[Eminem]
That's it, that's it, gotta hit than pass it
I'm blasted off a tab of acid
Flabbergasted
Hopped in a cab and blasted the cab driver
I said...haha
Hold on a minute
Give me infinite beats that I can kick for a minute
Y'all don't understand
The way that I got this mic in my hand
Killing any MC who stands or sits or walks
Or is handicapped
It doesn't matter, Mr. Handicap, hand me that
Haha
I clap hands with the rap fans
Jump in their wheelchairs and give 'em a lap dance
I'm the illest MC who will kill this
And what?
And Die Hard like who?
(Bruce Willis)
Thank you very much that's a fucking cliche
But I will rock the microphone and don't care about what he say
Or they say or I say or we say or them say
Eminem say shit that only Slim say
Or Slim says
Fuck a les
-bian in her ass
Korean or a...
Haha

[Interlude: Proof talking]
Ayo, let me try something. Uh uh uh uh uh uh. I'm not free in here, check it out

[Proof]
I rap if there was no rap within a soul clap
Expose wack rappers and smack 'em with my bozack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Punch my fist through the torso of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood make a serious winner lose
Get high of gin and booze

[Eminem]
Hahahaha
In an inner tube
While I'm in the nude
With a centerfold
In the winter cold

[Proof]
Ayo we give it though
Give me an envelope
I get open with Tim Westwood show
And Cypher Sounds I strike you down
Don't like the way you sound, you wack now
You got my style packed down or should I say down pack
Any MC's will tell you right now that you sound wack
Call us up and then we make noise then see shells
We shall prevail you faker than Lee Nails
And we tell D-12 to all those that don't know
Flow for flow we rocking your radio
How you feel right now?
C'mon Shady flow
Yo, yo, yo

[Interlude: Eminem and Proof talking]
[E] Yo, turn the beat up a little bit
[P] I know, it's like the beat is like mad low
[E] Hello, hello, hello, check, check, check
[P] Hello
[E] Check, check, check

{beat switches to LL Cool J's 'Ill Bomb'}

[E] What, what?
[P] Awwww shit
[E] Yo, turn it up a little bit
[P] Yeah, just turn it up, up, up, up
[Cypher Sounds] C'mon Tim turn it up
[E] Yeah, just turn it up Tim
[P] Let it be distorted. Yo, yo, yo

[Eminem]
Trapped in a cinema, in a material world
Criminal, cops scour the rural area thorough
Cause I kissed a girl, married a girl
Carried a girl to the cemetery, buried a girl
And I'm desperate, no one to mess with
Always get arrested for something domestic
And I kill the way you met me
You'll never catch me, cops can't sketch me
You can't upset me, no matter how bad
How mad you get me
Problem with y'all, I'm letting the Tec speak
Went from sweet to hard
Beat the odds
From no hoes to show, quit the pizza job
No more fools to rob, no more geeks to rob
No more stolen cars, no more Visa cards
(Visa cards)
Slim Shady
(Slim Shady and D-12)



[Verse: Eminem]
Come in spittin', with not writtin', non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this, with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' kleenex, so I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chillin with Phoneix, with two Coronas
I'm on the microphone and I'm a own this
Yo, and I'm a bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turn tables
With my man, but he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo check it out I bust rhymes and get, groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said I'm 27 years old, yo, I'm an adult, kid
But, yo still, Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'm a always bill and kill, my baby's mama
Just to piss the world off, just to piss the girls off
Yo I earl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, ya'll can't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out, and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret, like pop secret
Rappers they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfucking, D
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Yo, yo Slim Shady



[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Yo, it's Kuniva, I'll cuss hoes out like a drunk sailor
And cock the hammer back like Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor
You best be on your best behavior before I slay ya
And watch the video of your life with your Lord Savior
I can go in off your mom, they get along when they see the gun
And Dirty Dozen cross my arm and it ain't a secret, get scared
And be nervous ‘cause I'ma be in jail in a cell with C-Murder
Shady is a general, a soldier form I showed it to him
He saved my life, I owe it too him, so compare it to anybody
I serve you on a platter, your words dont even matter
You all you leavin' badder
I'm a hazard without bowl and loop doop
I shoot through people at super markets
While they ringin' up your fruit loops
You challengers get pushed off banisters
I'm unavoidable like anvals, droppin' on toon characters

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm the freak slasher, chop bodies up in meat packer
I reach back for the necks, choppin' your feet faster
Than Steven King, I repeatedly beat bastards
The pops for result of havin' a meet in maggots
When I see faggots, put three in they fleece jackets
You bleed rapid, poppin' all in your lead actors
Speed and acids when I mourn, didn't even ask for it
Technique's hazardous, you needin' Jesus of Nazereth
To see what's happenin', means havin' your teeth chatterin'
Speak battlin', heat splatter your peeps abdomin
Sweet fashion, I reload and I keep blastin'
I breathe action, if you dont believe ask him

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I'm sick of bitches, man, I done heard enough shit
Talk a lot of mouth like they wanna do it
Then they pull down they pants and then I shoot fluid
Then they start runnin', screamin' like they God called them
And I called them back and then pulled a crackin' in
Stick my dick up in and make them rap again
They wanna rap for me and tell me that they love me
Kon Artis, you're my daddy and I dont wanna be your hubby
I can't be your hub, baby, I ain't gettin married
I'm stand fuckin' bitches, it really very scary
My lil cousin named Terry told me that I fucked him too long
And then I gotta get a Jerry curl to make 'em all keep drippin'
You niggas know I never really be trippin', my beats bang
Make ears bleed through Walkman's
That's why people ignore you like you ain't even talkin'
You chit chatter and get splattered by a disease beat addict
That spit spontanious like a Prayin Mantis, I cut you off
Pickin' that gang green, your man seen how I get ignorant
By losin' my spleen, the truth of the seen as soon as my team
Get on, we rule cities like 'Zila through Hong Kong
You wanna knew, you wanna know
You gotta ask my man Proof how the fuck the flow goes

[Verse 4: Proof]
Pull it back, pull it back, pull it back, pull it back
We ain't wentin' no where, we sippin' Champagne
Shady Records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady Records, no chedder than us
Shady Records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady Records, I got your ears goin'
Like it's sparkles in my rhymes
Hotter than a felon in a carload full of 9's
Got the sparkles out to shine, get your back up
And get your dollars out your spines
Because the head is ill, I'm in love with Natasha Betinville
Yo, faster than a Porsche
Make you disappear like advertisement in The Source
So do it, baby, I want the sugar, baby
My sift from the rabies
Yo, Proof, D12, is on the hiatus, on a scale from 1-10
I'm an 8, wait, you don't know how 8 is, 8 is Jigga
That's me, 9 is Slim, 10 is Slim, now I finally give you
The time I give you to Bom Artis has got promise
And me and Proof and Swift and the Kon Artis
And it ain't over, boy, who you beef with, trust me
I'll tell you Puffy and you can lose big ‘cause it's that
Face it, I'm a brick face, you get it laced with a switch blade
Yo, I stab you with a mixtape
Tell your girl, ask her how my dick taste
I told you once before that I'm a brick face
I'm a big and I shine, plus I spit mace
Make all the bad boys that's missin' listen up
Yo, next on this transition, and you know how it is
And you know when it's gravy
Next up, chigga-chigga Slim Shady

[Verse 5: Eminem]
I done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit, not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit, Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully, Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin' on, shit, I been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin' some shit
To get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit, I could spit better, I'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again
Look, the game just ain't the same, it's changin'
Shit, Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin'
Now it's just wangstas just sayin' the same shit
It's fake and it's ancient
It's makin' me so bored, I'ma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba kubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human, I'm a suicider supersonic suicidal unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama
Press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lot of talk and rumors honest
"Who's the hottest?" – to be honest
Hip-hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us

[Outro: Proof]
Ayo, Shady Records, ain't nobody better than us

I done figured this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
To my success, I merked for me repeatedly
(GreenLantern) “The evil genius”
We done be, to beat MC’s
Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master, the art of war, don't start a war
Shit, not no more; we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sick; I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain’t got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit, Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully; Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy!
Ain't shit going on, shit, I've been getting so bored lately
I'm thinking of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth, I liked the shit better then, shit, I could spit better
I'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again, look:
The game just ain't the same, it's changing
Shit, Dre is quitting, Jay is quitting, now it's just wankstas
Just saying the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
And It's making me so bored I'mma just make a new language
Fubba-u-cubba-kubba yubba obubba ubba
You-ba can subbabick my dadibbadick through a tuba!
Summa dumma lamma I'm not a human, I'm a suicidal supersonic
Suicidal Unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Dahmer left me with this legacy to carry on
A lot of talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us
[Outro Konartist] – Shaddy records, they ain’t better than us
Shaddy records, they ain’t making more cheddar than us
Shaddy records, they ain’t better than us

[Sample x4]
"Fuck it, friends or no friends
I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I should've been able to see that you were the one behind this
But I was blind as fuck to think that you
Weren't the kind that stuck some one in the spine this
It was as if our friendship broke in half
And I watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
And both of us know we can't discuss the situation like adults
Each confrontation just results in accusations and insults
So I'ma just let it go for now, and leave you be
It's over now; what goes around comes back around
Believe you me, lay low for now; come here, you fuckin'…

[Hook: Proof]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
Why I oughta beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
Why I oughta beat a nigga that's up to no good, haha

[Sample x2]
"Fuck it, friends or no friends
I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Why don't you take a second to stop
And think about what you done
And you want to call that "being a friend"
That isn't what you want
All because of what, you run your mouth
You wanna prance around and gloat?
Let's see how well you dance around
When I got my hands around your throat
‘Cause it's a matter of time till I get my blows in
And it won't be long
You shouldn't go walkin' around
And stickin' your nose in where it don't belong
‘Cause every time you talked
When you was stretchin' the truth
There's gonna be one more flyin' knuckle
You're gonna catch in the tooth
Come here, come here, you fuckin'…

[Hook: Proof]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
Why I oughta beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
Why I oughta beat a nigga that's up to no good, haha

[Sample x2]
"Fuck it, friends or no friends
I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Come here, you lil double-crossing
Going-behind-my-back snitcher
Good-for-nothin'-but-trouble-causing, instigatin' fact switcher
You were the least that I suspected
'Til the puzzle fell into place with every piece that I selected
But I'll never let that crap happen again
You come back blabbin' again
Catch it smack dab in the chin; that's for backstabbin' a friend
‘Cause every name in the book wouldn't be enough
So I just figured I'd say your name in the hook
Check it out, come here, you fuckin'…

[Hook: Proof]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
Why I oughta beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
Why I oughta beat a nigga that's up to no good, haha

[Sample x4]
"Fuck it, friends or no friends
I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end"

[Outro: Proof]
Backstabbers don't live too long. Around my way friendships betrayed; in the hood you die for that!
For those that don't love this combat and verbally say this
This could relate to the death of a backstabber
Thats like the desire to make total discombobulation and combustion of the neck
The backstabber for the female, you skeezin' ass bitch nigga!
So remember, the backstabber always loses in the end
A friend is a friend to the end
F-R-I for Fri, E-N-D a friend for the end, yes, to eternity
The backstabber shall never flourish; take 'em out...



[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
A shimmy shimmy go go motherfucking pop, bitch
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been getting laid and paid that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fucking with the blue eye
Fucking with my 2-5 up your fucking ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to
We're fucking up your city and we're fucking up your program
Fucking all your bitches we can fucking give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fucking planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakings
So let me get what I got coming and the rest I'm taking
I'm shaking like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like the motherfucker's new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit giving my heart and soul
Been shining like a diamond but getting passed as coal
So Fuck Off
Yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Rock]
With my pants half hanging off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom tripping sipping shots of Jack
Cause the kids don't listen getting lots of flak
I be the do wah diddy up and down you block and
The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cocking
The K the I the D R-O-C-K motherfucker and you still don't know me
So blow me bitch I don't rock for *cancer*
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection, this much is true
We do what we say, you say what we do
Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much P to ever *be no homo*
I rock from SoHo to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreaming of Winona
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Caray couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck Off

[Interlude: Kid Rock]
Yeah right in your mother fucking ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit swift we're on the same script
Nothing new since '76, Kid Rock
Yo, Slim Shady come break these motherfuckers off

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo!
Tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathin' the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of motherfuckers
Who hate the world just as much as each other
And I ain't leavin' this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do shrooms you all better give me two rooms
Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block, you better lock your cars
Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fools and every single teenager that hates school!
FUCK OFF!



[Eminem (Mr. Porter)]
Yea!
(What was that?)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
I'm busy
I'm busy
I'm busy
I'm busy
Don't bother me, not me
Mr Porter, I'm busy
I'm busy
Tryin' to talk to the crowd (okay)
Goddamnit, you win

[Intro: Noreaga]
Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our shit, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly shit
You know what I'm sayin', some get high shit
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy shit, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that shit he be doin'

[Hook: Slim Shady]
You ain't into fuckin' drugs, fuck you
You don't do ecstasy, fuck you
You don't pop mushrooms, fuck you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, fuck you

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his ass
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em
I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
"Alright, Mr. Mathers, pick 'em up!"
No you pick 'em up! Bitch, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this shit no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office

[Hook: Slim Shady]
Faggot, fuck you, work at the post office, fuck you
Talkin' shit to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' dick, fuck you
If you're a white rapper, fuck you
Talk shit about Stretch? You're cool
But if you don't talk shit about Stretch, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' punk, fuck you
Talk shit about me, fuck you
You wanna battle me, fuck you
I ain't got to say shit to you but fuck you



[Royce Da 5'9']
Ryan’s a homocidal misfit
I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff and some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violence psychotic
With the vile polish politics by the way I’m higher than the Eiffel tower tip
I like writing but I will stick this pencil in your ass before I write ya shit
Pause, inhale hell n kush, us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felon’s, crooks, going door to door like he’s selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mush
Now my bitch dancer, I’m bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you probably rip ya pants off
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It’d probably smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me anchor man, I’ll hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water and go and drown a fish
Fuck I’m fucking heinous, I’ll make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you sayin’

[Eminem]
Fuck, it’s fucking raining, shit, it’s lightening
Bitch, its thundering, cause I’m hushing up I’m a storm if you wonderin’
Shit, shit you could muster up a thought, to take a toter? and a brain fart
Want urine in your face, all you had to do was say it
You wish you woulda just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolise the game
Illuminati is here, yeah, human oddities
At odds with us, just whats gotta be
Cause we started out cold and it snowballed
We froze, soon as we rolled up on these hoes
All’s we know is you over the bar like Limbo/ Limbaugh
You know who you are
So quit fucking the dark before we start callin’ you bizaare
Shit screw the boots, ya’ll dun raped a pitbull
Fell in love with Shih-tzu
This is directed directly at you
And as for these hoes who don’t know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin’, fuck a ballsack if the taints can’t take you on a date
You mistake me for a gentleman, your 2000 and late man, Will-I-ain't
I’m the bad guy, type of guy that will drag 5 girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants and the first one who pee’s gets a black eye

[Hook - Eminem]
You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

[Joell Ortiz]
Puffing loosies, watching I Love Lucy with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I’m Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don’t know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
Everything you kick weak, your speak kung fu yazy
All my homeboys, 2.0 boys
Nickle, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce!
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain’t got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moist
Bang bang bang bang, house gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussy’s, don’t ask what we came for
I write til my right arm vein’s sore
Forearm feel like Thor’s arm in a gang war
You hear that Yaowa, you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cess-poolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to nay hood, bigger than jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
So I’m well prepped if you just want war
There’ll be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It’s raw, you keep acting like you don’t know Mouse, nigga
And you gon’ need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought’s rotten, they gems are fool’s gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I’ll exonerate
I’m Martin King staring at a picture of Obama’s face
Talking funds, niggas ain’t never seen stock
I don’t need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Hook - Eminem]
You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

[Crooked I]
Takeoff, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
I’m kind of a Dahmer, I’m grinding
Now rappers are lining up jackers, I’m climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I’m the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles, particles
Tell me when and I’m there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like a limited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don’t fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it’s coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I’ma step on you, bring it to yo yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the west
I’m Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Yelawolf]
I got no Jim Beam in the liver
Getting head like clean clippers, with haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16′s like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain’t seen sicker
Then I’ll crack, and then I’ll hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pumper stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that’s as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I’m Illuminati, so f-ckin’ ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it’s only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love where the clown’s hanging
And the freakshow’s at the county carnival then you pay
Bitch, I’m on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling “Go Shady” driving slower than an old lady
In an old ’89, no piece if you pay me
Gimme peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I’m getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago woulda broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain’t fucking wit’ Budden, you ain’t got no choice with Royce
You don’t wanna see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the porno boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then homie, I deploy
Game over

[Eminem]
Yo, I don’t think they heard you, tell ‘em again
[Yelawolf]
Game Over



[Verse 1: 2pac]
I'm livin rough and raw
Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane
Hustle till the mornin, never stop until the cash came
Was hyper as a kid
Cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa-hatin niggas tryin to sound like us
Nigga then we first to bomb, bust on these bitch-made niggas
Hit em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, no fuckin from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggas wonder why I got shot but didn't die Let em see who's next to try
Did I cry?, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Niggas still ballin

[Hook 1: 2pac]
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically, I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta
And why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryna get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me "don't say that"?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

[Hook 2: Ice Cube]
I can say what I wanna say
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Click, click, boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear em holla "Goon Squad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Goon Squad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Runyon Ave!" in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky?
Imma dial 911 like a mothafuckin punk
Fuck that, blah blah, Imma call that rude boy from Detroit
Trick, trick, quick come pick me up!
Bring them guns, come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin some junk, cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up, cause uh, somethin smells a lil fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin at me
So homie, come get me
Wonder Boys what up tho, I see you, rock bottom yeah I see you
Detroit motherfuckers till we die

[Hook 3: 2pac]
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Now everything's good in my hood
And it's on and poppin, Eazy-mothaphukkin-E from east side south Compton
Straight givin up the real
On how a nigga feel
Talk that shit, motherfuckers' caps get peeled
Layin low in the cut
Gettin high than the mothafucka, niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta-gangsta, is that what they're still yellin?
Nigga G to a T, saggin and bailin
Live by the gun, you know what I'm sayin Ren?
So I guess I'll die by that motherfucker then
So when I die, niggas bury me
Make sure my shit reads "Eazy-mothaphukkin-E"
And it's a fact
To be exact, my tombstone should read "He put Compton on that map"
And that's how a nigga feel
When I'm givin up the motherfuckin real

[Refrain: 2pac and Eazy-E]
(2Pac: Ballin in the fast lane, the fast lane!)
(Eazy-E: The motherfuckin real, real, shots goin out to the hardcore hip hop)
(2pac: Hustle till the mornin)
(Eazy-E: The motherfuckin real, real, real, real... Buckin these niggas till they drop)
(2pac: Bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many playa-hatin niggas tryin to sound like us
Ballin in the fast lane
Nigga then we first to bomb, bust on these bitch-made niggas
Hit em up, Westside!)

[Verse 5: MC Ren]
Well it be the real niggas back with that hard street shit
Bitch niggas be pissin a fit, but I say fuck em when I buck em
It's that nigga with the cool and mellow shit for your ass
Takin niggas back through the past
All up on my nuts, shit be swingin like a fist
Can't even take a piss, if I did niggas would cut they wrist
In a motherfuckin candy 4, beat that ass with the switch
Then blast, on the bitch who was all in my shit
It's that nigga Ren back for the '9-5
They say real niggas was dead but this nigga be alive, so I'm, puttin it down with that nigga E
For all of my niggas in the C-P-T
So here we go again with part 3 of the script, makin bitch-made niggas bite they lip when we dip
So tell me how the fuck do it feel
To get hit with the motherfuckin real?

[Hook 4: 2pac]
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, till the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin

[Verse 6: Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, got an ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks over night
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight, laid back
I got some money to make motherfucker

[Pre-Hook: 2pac]
Did I cry? hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Nigga still ballin

[Hook 5: Ice Cube]
I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Swangin my, bangin my, swangin my Coupe Deville
Scoop! DeVille, like that, right back
Top for the hill
Wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin underwater like I'm Aqua Man
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand
Pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
Rocky land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug a boo
Flipped out, cripped out, nigga what it really do?
Time brings change so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin my wings
Groupie ass niggas see ya chippin the game
With nothin to gain, plop, plop, pop and I bang

[Hook 6: Ice Cube]
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it



[Eminem]
Gee willikers Gatman, they got me surrounded

[50 Cent]
I'm on my way

[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]
I got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a (bat, man)
What the fuck are you retarded?
You touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
This ain't Batman, Robin, Cagney or Lacey
It's 50 Cent and Shady, the worst, baby
Put your hands on my peoples I'll react crazy
Put a hole through your front and your back, maybe
But go 'head, you try me
I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV
I leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I react like an animal and tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art
Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts (woo!)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
Hammer cocked back, hollow tip in the chamber, danger
Anger'll change ya, and make you aim at -- and squeeze

[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]
I got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a (bat, man)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Motherfucker, you retarded?
You touch 50, I'll leave you dearly departed
We're walking away from a beef in which clearly you started
I said we're walking away, did you hear me?
You oughta be thankful that we ain't beefin'
We’re still breathing and just leave it at (THAT!)
'Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT—mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rap it's gonna be (BRRAT!)
Retaliation, it'll be like them Muslim Shiia (ATTACKS!)
Somewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a (PACT!)
He's got my back, I got his back (BACK!)
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
'Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit
Like we're conjoined at the hip, this is unavoidable
Some of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over
Some of it will just simmer at best if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sitdowns
With no Daves and 'Zinos
There will be no peace discussions with me
There ain't gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fucking with me and I'll gladly quit fucking with you
Just spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentioning me
Or the machine of Jimmy Iovine or Dre or 50
Or D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be
Or we'll be (knock knock) with a

[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]
(Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a (bat, man)
What the fuck are you retarded?
You touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Nigga you get it twisted, you gon' get your wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie, I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, you plot it, you can count me in I'm with it
You cross me, you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I talk 'cause I live it
Shell cases drop, when that chopper chop, way up the block
Get hit with copper tops, when the drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run call the cops
This ain't new, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you, I want it
It's not a game, perfect aim
You feel the flame up against your brain
Man it's so hot, I'll make you wish it rained

[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]
I got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a (bat, man)
What the fuck are you retarded?
You touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed
(Woo, woo!!)



[Giriş: Pusat & Sansar Salvo]
Pusat!
Sansar!
Pit10!
Naber?
Olympos!
2004!
2007!

[Verse 1: Pusat]
Magazin muhabirleri henüz kapıda yok evet
Ama tanıdığım insanlar beni konuşuyo gerek hop demek
Cop gerek ağızlarına, sussunlar artık
Dedikodu kazanı içinde fareler, kussunlar kancık

Çevrem boş vaatler içinde her biri Cem Uzan
Engeller var isteklerini önünde hayatımız hep kural
Ben orduların önünde yek duran gerekti mi sert vuran (Evet!)
En az Irak'ın işgali kadar saçma benim dert [?]

Popülarite meraklısı fanlarım comment atar
Tanımadığım adamlar Myspace'ten bana kanka yazar
Pusat BigBoss damga basar sen gazla kaşar
Onun bunun eskisine ben değil ancak Rahdan takar

Gittiğim mekanlarda gözler beni arar iltifat yağar
Damlar bana bakar, bilirim hepsi yalakalar
Cebinde paran yanında manitan varsa [?]
Komşuda pişer ümitleriyle tanıdıklar etrafta yer kapar

Sıkıldım, sahte gülücük ardı sinsi hisler
Çıkar menfaat olaylarını kovalayan kolpa tipler
Hepsinin soyunu kırmak gerekir ve ben şimdi Hitler
Katil ya da artist sıfatı takılır bende kirli izler

[Verse 2: Sansar Salvo]
Sadece evine gidiyorum, iki dakika rahat ver
İçimdeki şeytan diyo "Rapçi misin, karar ver"
Düşünüyorum bi' yıldız olsam kollarımda fahişeler
Fotoğraflar, çekimler sonra muhabirler

Sönük bi' rapçiyken bile bu bana ağır geliyo
Ama hayalime kavuşmak için kovalıyom
Orospular hatıra diye önümde domalıyo
Bu kadar çıkar ki ibnenin içinde bunalıyom

Herkesin bana sorduğu tuzak dolu sorular
Bana laf atan rapçilerin çoğunun yolu var
Savaş devam eder anlamıyorum hit olmayan
"Duygusuz İfade" en boktan parçalarımdan

Bi' beat için aşk yaşarsın, bence tam kaşarsın
2004 eski günler, Olympos hatırlarsın
Benim tek muhatabım, varsa fanlarım
Geri kalanı umrumda değil, kusura bakmayın

Çok yüksekken kaydettiğim raplerden medet umma
Şarkılarını dinlerken vokallerimi ara mumla
Ara yolda vukuat ve alayı da karakolda
Bence bütün kızlar tavlanabilir para pulla

[Verse 3: Pit10]
Kimi zaman bunalıp çekilmek isterim bi' kasabaya
Ya da buna son vermek için gereken kasada var
Apaçık hapı yutup itildim o durumlara ben ama
Birini gördüğümde demem lazım "Merhaba"

Onlar ister yedi yirmidört beraber takılalım
Zorlar ister lakin yaşantımı bilsen akıl alır
Orda pislen ulaşma ve bulaşmadan zarı atın
Zorda bizler umursamayan arada karı kalır

İçinde bulunduğum bu yararsız boş kalabalık
Onlar benim adıma düşünür ve karar alır
Kendime ve dostlarıma yazarım ben kafa çakır
Pop düetim battıysa hesabıma para yatır

Kimi vardı geldi geçti iz bıraktı deldi deşti
İstemiştim dostum olsun geldi yine de verdi beşlik
Çoğu zaman çıkar için koştu yanıma geldi leydi
Anlamsız bi' derbideydim orda eksik terbiyeydi

Bi' gün hedefi vurucam ben ve bakıcam delice
Anlamsızca yorumlardan ne kalıcak geride
Boş olduğumu düşünmüştü silah taktı beline
Lan ordunu geri çek onların hepsi renegade

You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better

[Verse 1: Proof]
Doing a box of doctrine, on stomping oxygen
? ? wit fork to your optic lens
Hitting wit a sudden force
Leave your boy laying in the same puddle of blood as yours
When I flood his porch
Smuggle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
A double-deuce wit slugs, I'm Proof on drugs
We'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
High on medicine cabinet pills
Grabbing the steel, leaping over buildings that haven't been built
I'm not the best yet cuz I haven't been killed
I'm laughing at you faggot-ass rapping for deals, you better

[Hook: Eminem]
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fucking gas for thirty minutes this morning
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change
I'm having a bad day
My fucking dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fucking mad cuz I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right
Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam
I swear to God, this 'Pac poster comes any closer
I'm kicking this whole fucking wall over
Two more shots and it's all over
I'm all over this wall, trying not to fall over

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
BLOAW BLOAW!
Shots in broad day
(BIZARRE, THAT'S YOUR MOM!)
The bitch shouldn't have been in the way
Me, Shady and Mike fucking a hemaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin till late last night
High off a kite off of stick of sherm
Put your mother in a full-nelson while my boys take turns
A unibomber trying to escape this country
Tell O.J. he better be coming up wit my money
Bizarre goes commercial? Nigga, you can forget it
B-- suck my *dick* that is the radio edit
I'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe
I ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fucking assholes
Battle me, you better go eat your vegetables
I'm iller than a Muslim eating a pork hotdog in African festival
This shit is serious, watch me sniff 'cane
Avoid the pain and fuck a bitch barely potty-trained

[Hook: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back

[Verse 1: Proof]
Doing a box of doctrine, on stomping oxygen
After 10 put a fork to your optic lens
Hitting wit a sudden force
Leave your boy laying in the same puddle of blood as yours
When I flood his porch
Smuggle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
A double-deuce wit slugs, I'm Proof on drugs
We'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
How you on medicine cabinet pills
Grabbing the steel, leaping over buildings that haven't been built
I'm not the best yet cause I haven't been killed
I'm laughing at you faggot-ass rapping for deals, you better

Get back, get back
You better get back, get back back

You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back [repeat both lines 5x]
You better get the FUCK back



[Hook: Anna]
You can't let nobody stand in your way
You've just got to get back up yeah, you've just gotta get back up, ho-oh
And take down everything that you cannot change now
You've just got to get back up yeah, you've just gotta get back up, ho-oh

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, what it is, world? Yeah, it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No runnin' from the truth, as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For lettin' you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now sayin' "Whatever, here we go again"
Blogs, radio and television all goin' in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fuckin' haters is hilarious (ha-ha!)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me looking down (down)
Same clown that was twitpicking at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces and you Nazis
Watch me cause you thinkin' you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed as you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to and it's called
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not a holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash them down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

[Hook]



[Eminem]
We ready? Ayo, before...
Ayo, before this CD "Shit Happens" begins to play
Please, stock up your liquor, your weed, your whores
Bash faggots, your popcorn, bash faggots, and your drugs
Bash faggots, and enjoy the sound
Of the Detroit's own DJ Butter
Bash faggots, this is Slim Shady, and I'm high, bash faggots
Oh, and by the way I'm not a gay basher, bash faggots



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, I get it
I run this rap shit, now guess who's back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)

[Verse]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!



[Intro: Eminem & Kon Artis]
*Gun being cocked*
I'm gonna get my gun!

This motherfucker wants to disrespect me?
Em, Em, what the fuck you doing, man
I got something for his ass
Calm down!
No, YOU calm down!
Man, what's your problem
Fuck that, the motherfucker wants to pop shit to me!?
Man, he wasn't popping shit
You heard him, he was popping that shit!
What shit?
That shit, you heard him!
He asked for your autograph!

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
A mass murderer, pack burners to blast further then you can get
My shit be shooting through bricks
I mix anything together, I done guillotine a nigga
Keep a heater that pop clips with seventeen or better
I'll be severing heads, I'm in everyone's nightmare
A nigga that can never ever be scared of the feds
Send the niggas that'll fuck with you
Stab and brass knuckle you
Then have you in the public, there's nothing that you can do
Enough with you're motherfucking tough talk, you're soft
Get you're balls blew off, from a sawed-off, I'm raw dog
Crazier then all y'all, got you like the navy when I'm angry
You'll never catch me hanging in a Narc's car
All I have is thought of, breathing evil
Desert Eagles will eat through people
When I see you I'mma heat your beef slow
Fuck being peaceful, the piece in the vehicle and
(I'm gonna get my gun!)

[Hook: Eminem]
This motherfucker's popping that shit
Nah, fuck that, I'll be right back
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Nah, motherfucker, fuck you
You ain't disrespecting me like that
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Walk to the room, sixteen shot clip
Bitch, how you like that
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Bet you ain't know that I'm strapped
Nice one, bitch, this is my gat
(I'm gonna get my gun!)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I bring it to niggas looking as if they want trouble
I send they body flipping around like a stunt double
Forget about the fighting, scrapping, squabing, bucking
I'll squeeze the piece you jumping, dodging, ducking
Squatting under trucks and screaming "that nigga's bluffing"
I cuff my nuts while cussing "don't trust him"
I round up Runyan, Dave, Wood and Nico
My nigga Big I and Mal' letting the heat blow
Heat seek hoes got A&E closed
Cause you keep shooting at me and missing like Shaq's free-throws
You gotta get a little closer if you wanna try
Pistol whip a soldier, with a missile on his shoulders
We can fold or blow your brick house into some tiny boulders
A grimy, older cat will leave you with a tiny odour
I'm doggish, you feeling froggish, then leap bitch
My car is right across the street bitch and (I'm gonna get my gun!)

[Verse 3: Proof]
My whole outfit count clips, get your house lit the fuck up
Your spouse shit, and your mouse clip
Better bounce, bitch, countless, slugs I'mma send
Watch you holler when the hollow tips go through your skin
I'm in love with the sin, tell Bugz I'mma see him
When I cock back, right, I’ll put your blood on your friends
Make a rug outta him, bust a slug on his chin
Ain't going no were like the drugs outta Kim
I'm a psycho icon, a mightful might bomb
Get a eye full of lid when I slight your lights out
With a street cleaner, wipe your life out
Bullets gnaw at your ears, like a Tyson fight bout
Fuck the night clout, guns, clips...
(I'm gonna get my...)
Fuck that, run bitch!
Hit the streets talks, chumps don't know me
Ain't no prob to leave your whole bod' holey

[Hook fades out in the background]

[Eminem]
Dumbass motherfuckers always gotta come to me with some dumb shit
Fucking
I done told this motherfucker
Wassup, bitch?!
Autograph this!
Oh shit...

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm trying to pull the trigger but it's stuck, fuck
My shit is all jammed up, ugh
Come on, you cock-sucking, good-for-nothing
Motherfucking piece of shit shoot, ah
Yeah! What up, bitch!? Say that shit again
Shot, the bullet missed, hit a brick, bounced of it
Ricocheted back in his shin
Went through his bitch on it's way back, hit his friend
Payback homie, don't play that shit is spin
To be on I told you to leave this shit alone
Or... (I'm gonna get my gun!)
And it's a shame, I'm too drunk to even aim
Denaun stepped in the way and I shot him in his leg
It's like

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Bang, bang, bang, nigga, pow, pow, pow
Everybody busting rounds like they Ra', Ra', Ra'
But when you see me in the street I be like, what's up, now
Their bodyguard be stepping in trying to calm shit down
Fuck that! I got a bone to pick
You said it then we should address like some grown man shouldn't we
Then me and you could talk about our problems couldn't we
Just shoot a fair one and handle this situation seriously
I guess not, you want to resort to the heater
So I gotta grab my Mac and my Uzi and my Nina
Step in between us and get shot
But get separated with the squeaza
You ain't ready for war, Runyan ain't nothing to play with

[Hook: Eminem]
This motherfucker's popping that shit
Nah, fuck that, I'll be right back
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Nah, motherfucker, fuck you
You ain't disrespecting me like that
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Walk to the room, sixteen shot clip
Bitch, how you like that
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Bet you ain't know that I'm strapped
Nice one, bitch, this is my gat
(I'm gonna get my gun!)

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Walk to Rite-Aid for a can of spaghetti
It's been one hour, bitch, my photos ain't ready
Pictures of my dog and my family reunion
It's been two hours and my fucking days ruined
Hey, Kate, do you wanna get raped
Have my pictures on fucking Philips 38
That's why I don't be fucking battle rapping
Cause every time I lose, this what the fuck happens *Gunshots*
Back to the pictures I was trying to get developed
This man tried to get in front of me, I wouldn't let him
I'm ready to blow this bitch's brains out
I'm nervous, I farted, some shit came out
Times up, shot her with a gun
Got on my cellphone and called Reverend Run
And all this crazy shit, I regret it
All because I wanted to see Elton John naked



[Intro]
Ayo, what do you think about, two grown ass men, living together?
Haha, alright, what do you think about, another grown ass man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well, them two grown ass men living together on my nuts
And that's you right above them
Get the fuck off them!

[Bridge X2]
Run that shit back DJ Whoo Kid!
Run that shit back one more time!

[Verse]
When I rhyme, somehow I think I must be subliminally throwing
Viagra at these fags that got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows
Nothing is off limits, except for Michael's nose
I didn't know, I'm so sorry, please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended
Ooh, I got it, I got an apology for Steve Harvey too
It's in my pocket, uh, wait, here it is: FUCK YOU!
Hey! What do you say, Andre? What's new?
Life is good, man I'm chilling, 50 how bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, we'll get through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace, G-G-G-unit!

[Intro 1: Eminem]
Shady Aftermath
Whoo Kid, let's go
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Intro 2: DJ Paul]
This that trailer park hood shit
Yelawolf, DJ Paul, let's go

[Hook]
Crack that .40 out the gate
Yeah motherfucker get straight
If a motherfucker got shit to say
Crack that fucker in the face
Get straight (get straight), now get straight (get straight)
Yeah motherfucker get straight
There ain't a motherfucker got shit to say
Cause we'll set this bitch off out the gate

[Verse 1]
My beer bottle is ice cold
Drunk falls like I'm blindfold
Head busting them Xanax I'm a wild cracker that might blow
Got duct-tape on light pole
In a big cup like a Psycho
No need for that codeine, no need to lean in my Chevy
Hit high-beams on tight road
Yelawolf is a psycho
Sling Blades and renegades they operate at my shows
You talked up, you couch much, [?]
Fuck blood stains on the T-shirt I'm famous I don't buy clothes
Bouncing all in them mosh holes
Intercorse like a rhino
Killin shit now get a grip like handlebars on the vinyl
In the woods or a porch I could've been Hollywood in a condo
Practice with that Glock 9 you see them stop-sign holes

[Bridge: DJ Paul]
Slumerican's, let's go
Going in it right now
Yelawolf, DJ Paul
Famous Stars & Straps
Bowties, Alabama
Stand up!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Straighten up like a light pole
Straighten up like a seat back when you see that P-I-G dash
On the corner waiting fuck get back when you been drinking that bottle
Laying down on that throttle, here they coming now oh no
I'm all night partying, till my body's in, shock and I'll be in, overload
I'm la-dee-dah'ing, I don't care about much at all, I've got too much money
I'm in a Ferrari and, woke up in a new Bugatti and, threw up in a Pinto
I don't got to [?]
Give me the best MC I'll body him
[?]
Let him drown in his little bitty fish bowl
Are they gonna run up and say, pussy can I get a hit, (No)
I'll let you get a hit by the 2 mil' like a rope torn of a mixtape
(N-O)
One, two, then boil three
I put CD's and MP3's to make OG's look like (kinfolk)
You better put a mint fresh on a patty belt if you want some head
If you ain't a rapper still you better put a grill in front of that bye bye cig'
Bitch I'm a hungry hippo
Fuck 'em all, like a nympho
They can suck my valvoline from a pile of beans (Pinto)
Drive this bitch in a ditch I'm filthy rich but I'm (Pinto)
Dollar at cheaa, (kinfolk) haller at cheaa (kinfolk)

[Outro]

Y'all already know what the fuck it is
Fuckin' nuts in here right now
Slumerican
Shady, (fatality), let's go

[Hook]



Slaughterhouse…

[Intro]
...Presents, The Way It began
"Let’s see now
First thing I can remember is an evening years back
The four of us was together even then
And from that time on, nothing was ever gonna be quite the same again
Yeah, especially us"

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
G-G-God given, I’m killin’ this bomb bidniz
I’m calling rap that because I put my time in it
I-I don’t mind being ready to die as long as this is at an arena
And we did it and my momma seen it
This is my arm swinging and my alarm ringing
Fighting against time but writing this song singing
"In light of my wallet just look how the mighty have fallen"
You fell for it, say bye to them, say hi to Ryan mature
I can’t (lose) ‘cause God won’t let me (lose)
Bet against me you can go (lose)
Anybody can tell you (nah) nah
I knew the cats knew I was down so I fell back
Hit the ground, landed on my feet vertical, fell back too, so you can (lose)
I will never lay down and (lose), I was definitely about to (lose)
Then Eminem came like (“nah”) “nah”
This shit is entertaining, listen to the shit they saying
Venom is spraying which is why all I know is
I’m on a all time ultimate high inspired by all time low

[Hook x4]
How quick are you gonna get up

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
In these days life is short, shots’a try to end you
And this game is like a sport, comp’ll try to pen you
I leave the stage on life support when I rock a venue
If you ain’t got a knife and fork you’re probably on the menu
If I ain’t make history before I left
It will be like using my last important breath before my death for snorting meth
More or less, I'm, Jordan-esque, I ignore the refs
I son you like you morphed into a Orphan yes
(Lose) Nah, I never (lose) yeah, you said I would (lose)
My destiny said (nah), homie you went against me
Foolish as Judas, nigga you’re lost
Now I’m feeling like Black Jesus, wrong nigga to cross won’t (lose)
If I refuse to (lose) the fact that I used to (lose) is making me say (“nah”)
This is how we attacking it, four rappers who passionate
Took the idea of a group and re-imagined it without planning it
Now the whole planet has to admit that’s the shit

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Everybody y'all invited to a crazy party
Have some fun, blocking the sun with the Shady Army
These women is feeling like skin, baby, they be on me
My flow water for sure, I’m a great tsunami
I’m with my awesome clique on another touring trip
From front of the stage all the way back to the door it's thick
Like secretly filming a mob, we recording hits
What a fucking lifestyle, maybe that’s why I'm on my dick
(Lose) Man, I ain't about to (lose) I don’t know how to (lose)
You beating the yaowa (nah) Mr. Ortiz I got you
Can’t find a reason not to, my ink, take 'em to church
Guess you could call it pentecostal, man Eminem told me (lose) yourself
So how can I (lose) focus, you roaches
(Lose) In combat so war? (nah), but if y’all need me to make it clear, for those slightly impaired
Like a flat in a snowstorm with no gas we ain’t going nowhere
We the sixty minute group, this year finna be our year!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
A mixture of showman and skill, imposing my will
A visionary, want me with my back to the ground, I ain’t with the missionary
Walk in my shoes and reap all of that I gain
Along with every invisible woe that accompanies fame
Louis Vuitton frames cover the scars that go with stardom
Got enemies that I birthed these bars are for Postpartum
So I tuck me the steal plate, they threatening me from behind a condom
But you can’t scream, fuck me! Then feel safe you just (lose)
Some people are praying I (lose), I thought I was set up to (lose)
Then Slaughterhouse came like (nah) nah
So I live by a real simple philosophy
If you stay grounded watch God keep giving you reasons not to be, can't (lose)
It’s not in my plan to (lose), if I still happen to (lose)
Is that even possible (nah), keep that out of my reach
Still I’m praying the shit get manifested
Let the flow stage dive and hope for the fans to catch it
If you ever persevered you should understand the message

[Hook]

[Outro]
The rest, what they say, is history



[Intro: Eminem]
Yo, mic-check (My dick)
Testing, one, two, fuck (My dick)
My nuts

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My attitude is worse than N.W.A's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit
And diss people who ain't have shit to do with it
Like Cool J does (My tattoo)
You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', "Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children"
I look at my life in a new light
Fuck it, give me two mics
I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (Oh, hell yeah)
Every place and event, been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson 1, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson 2, face 'em and diss 'em (What up, dawg?)
Don't give 'em a demo, kidnap 'em
(Come on, you're comin' with me, motherfucker, check this out)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson 3, get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
(Here, listen)
Lesson 4, know you heard this before
"Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow for sure"
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can (Hey dude, come here)
Lesson 5, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit, bitch, don't even bother askin' me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin', like Master P (Ungh)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said, "See ya"
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in
And caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
White trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass
While you're out siphonin' gas
For your lawn mower to cut the grass

[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
(Yo, why you diss me?)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
(A big dick)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad (Nurse, nurse)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi, Renée (Oh, hi)
I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away (What?)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?
Blood drippin' from it
Rippin' your stomach like a paper mâché
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill, though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here)
The demon is here, I'm steamin' this year
I rip ********* voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah, I don't think this guy is well"
I'm high as hell, I'll beat you with a live cat
When I'm swingin' him by his tail
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off, then sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Christopher Reeves
I was dealing with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathing machines
Flashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke

[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Outro: Eminem & Sway]
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (Yup)
Sway and Tech, sprayin' wreck (Bitch)
And we don't give a heck (Uh-uh)
Or a damn or a fuck or a shit
So suck my mothafuckin' dick
The Wake Up Show, let me tell you what it mean to me
It mean hard beats, hard rhymes, B-boys
Hip-hop, baby, all the way, forever



Giriş:
Yo, ses kontrol (Sikim!)
Ses, bir, iki… Siktir
Sikim, taşşaklarım!

Verse 1:
Tutumum N.W.A’inkinden daha kötü
Seninle saçma bir şey üstüne savaşacağım
Ve yapacak bir şeyi olmayan insanları dissleyeceğim
Aynı Cool J’in yaptığı gibi (dövmem!)
Beni evinin dışında durmuş
‘’Puffy iyi ama Slim Shady çocuklar için!’’ diye bağırırken görüyorsun
Hayatıma yeni bir ışıkla bakıyorum
Siktir et bana ik mikrofon ver
Şarkıları kendim için yazıyorum, ne düşündüğünü siklemiyorum
Beni büyük ihtimal yarım yamalak rap yaparken duyacaksın
Çünkü artık rapi sevmiyorum
Porno kariyerimin başlaması için uğraşıyorum
Her yerde ve her olayda bulundum
Siktir, Dre beni giderken valizin içine tıkadı
Anlaşmak mı istiyorsun? Bu 5 derse çalış
Ders 1: Anlaşmalı rapperlara bolca demo gönder
Ders 2: Karşılarına çık ve onları dissle (Naber adamım?)
Onlara demo gönderme, onları kaçır
Ve onları mekanına gelip, dinlemeye zorla. (Hadi orospu çocuğu benimle geliyorsun, şuna bi kulak ver)
Ders 3: Stüdyoda bir iş bul
Demoları Canibus ile değiş ve kendi demolarını patronun masasına koy
Ders 4: Bunu daha önce duydun
‘’Hey, bana numaranı ver, seni yarın arayacağız!’’
Eğer bir anlaşma imzalamak istiyorsan asla hayran gibi davranma
A&R şirketindeki en beyaz kişiyi bul (hey dostum, gel buraya)
Onu tut ve yapabileceğin en boktan rapi yap
Ders 5: Jive stüdyosundan biriyle tanış
I.C.P gibi giyin ve onların gelip seni canlı izlemesini sağla
Ve işte anahtar, ama beni eğer sokakta görürsen
Siklemeyeceğim orospu, yanıma gelmeye çalışma
Tuvalet suyu götüme sıçrıyor çünkü ben rap yaparken sıçıyorum
Aynı Master P gibi (Uğğğ)
Paula Jones’a blowjob yaptırdım ve ağzına kökledim
Toplarım, iki köprücük kemiğinide kırdı
Mya’ya söyle tüm bu olanlar ehh-işteydi
Alyssa Milano’ya sifilis ve belsoğukluğu ver
Ve takıldığım üç kızda bana ‘’Görüşürüz!’’ diyor
‘Çünkü Brandy ve Monica beni Aaliyah’ı sikerken yakaladı
Banyoda suyla oynuyorum
Bir avuç dolusu hapı, ortadan ikiye böl, iç ve gül
Beyaz serseri, sen çim biçme makinene gaz doldururken
Karını götünden sikiyor

Nakarat:
Yani ben özgüvenini zedeledim ve seni çok kötü dissledim? (Hey, neden beni dissledin?)
Biliyorsun bunu sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum
Ve ben senin olmasını istediğin boktan şeylerden bahsederken (Büyük bir sik)
Biliyorsun ki sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum
Bu şarkıyı dinleyemem, bu çok üzücü
Biliyorsun ki sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum
O başaramayacak, bileğindeki kesik çok kötü (Hemşire! Hemşire!)
Biliyorsun ki sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum

Verse 2
Ne güzel bir gün! Dışarı çıkıp, oynamalıyım
Evde oturup, kış uykusuna yatmak için bir sebebim yok
Hey, Renee! Yoluna bir bomba fırlatmak üzereyim o yüzden yoldan çekil
Jiletten yapılmış AIDS’li bir kılıçtan korkuyor musun?
Üzerinden kan damlıyor
Karnını deşiyor aynı tutkal gibi
Bir çok şey söylüyorsun ama asla iyi değilsin
Ben seni bir yastıkla boğabilecek kadar deliyim
İnekleri öldürdüm sırf şaka olsun diye
Zıpladım ve bir zürafayı boğdum
Boynunu kırdım ve ikiye ayırdım
Af diliyorum, sahneye çıkıyorum
Ve Cage’e Ajan Orange ile saydırıyorum
Sonrada kıçımı onun Source’taki sayfasıyla siliyorum
Şeytan burada, bu sene ortaya çıkıyor
Ses kutusunu parçaladım ve kulağına bağırdım
Bu hile değil, orospu bu bir imaj
Sikliyor muyum? Siklemek ne demek bilmiyorum
‘’Evet, bu adamın iyi olduğunu düşünmüyorum’’
Kafam çok iyi,  seni canlı bir kediyle öldürürüm
Ben senin… Ben senin… Taşşaklarını dolabına koyarım
Taşşaklarına çivili sopayla vururum
Boynunu keser, kafanı arkaya çeviririm
Ve seni öyle bırakırım
Sen seni Chris-stiff-er Reeves’ten bile biçimsiz bir şekilde bırakmaya can atan
Likörleri karıştıran bir serseriyi tetikledin
Annen emzirirken ona et yiyen bakteriler vereceğim
Ben bir çekiç alıp, dizlerini kıracak
Sonrada South Central L.A.’de dizleri kanarken yüreyecek birinden daha hastayım
(Ben Blood muyum yoksa Crip mi?)
Ertesi gün solunum makinesinde uyanıyorsun
Vurulduğun an aklına geliyor ve sahne tekrarlıyor
Eğer yaşarsan bunu anlatmaktan korkacaksın
Aynı Biggie ve Pac şakası gibi

Nakarat:
Yani ben özgüvenini zedeledim ve seni çok kötü dissledim? (Hey, neden beni dissledin?)
Biliyorsun bunu sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum
Ve ben senin olmasını istediğin boktan şeylerden bahsederken (Büyük bir sik)
Biliyorsun ki sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum
Bu şarkıyı dinleyemem, bu çok üzücü
Biliyorsun ki sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum
O başaramayacak, bileğindeki kesik çok kötü (Hemşire! Hemşire!)
Biliyorsun ki sadece seni kızdırmak için söylüyorum

Çıkış:
Biliyorum bu seni çok kızdırıyor, değil mi? (Uh, huh)
Bu doğru
Slim Shady (Yo)
Sway & Tech
Orospu
Biz siklemiyoruz, umursamıyoruz
O zaman sikimi yala

Shady 3.0



[Intro]
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I'm from where diapers full of feces we's endangered species
Bodies lay in traffic, that's right, where the streets be
You ain't seen nothin' this obscene from no TV
You would have to be me to feel what Obie's speakin'
Bodies leak like steel pipes, it's real creepy
Ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha, Jason Vorhee's
You're borin' me with your story, I'm a Detroitee
Craft took my mind so the craft exploits me

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
I got no pot to piss in, en route to prison
You don't want it with us nigga, we strapped with nitroglicerin
Our ambitions is some riders, thrivin' off poor decisions
A blessin' nigga still livin', still pimpin', still visions of
Sittin' in that foreign whip, whippin' up cola, take a lick
To my tongue, numb from the shit
My nuts hung since I was a young one
And that's just the slum fuck of it
I'm pumped daddy gone but, gun in my palm
My mama can't save me, her gender is wrong
On my own in this jungle that niggas call home
What? His mama died from a lump in her D cup
Police freeze 'em up for serving these glucks
It's like a habitual situation, we stuck
The ritual is for niggas to grab they nuts
And just soak all this bullshit up, where I'm from?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
I'm from real bridge 'cause, for niggas livin' hard
Welfare scarers just most chicks'll buy them broad
Pimpin' the government 'cause government pimpin' us
Rather see 'em sufferin' than niggas livin' up
'Cause you ain't heard? Bird got birds
But the nigga got murd' 'cause niggas felt he ain't deserve
What he was worth, he ain't a real nigga from the turf
He was birth with money, that's why they left him bloody
I'm from the streets where most these niggas nutty
I adapt to 'em, I'm exactly in tune with 'em
Strapped with the Mac that extract flesh from humans
Home sweet home, better known as The Ruins

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'm from the motherfuckin' slums where the cops don't come
Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the ghetto, ghetto



[Intro: 2Pac]
Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Outro: 2Pac]
Lord, can you hear me speak?
To pay the price of bein' hellbound



[2Pac - Speaking]
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine

[Slowed down voice]
You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so goddamn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on)
And then we'll be ghost

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA!



[Intro]
Ayo, dawg, I got some shit on my motherfuckin' chest
That I need to get off 'cause if I don't
I'ma fuckin' explode or somethin'
Now, look, this is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

[Verse 1]
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more, it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin' their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broken, you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm tellin' you right now, motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see, he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin' cipherin' name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you were sayin' and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin' weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin' 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on, dawg, he was s'posed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared? And Fred, you said you was dissin' him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy, up on stage, screamin' how people hate you
They don't hate you, they just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song, I'm tryna to pre-warn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you, dog, I'm swingin' on you!
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all some...

[Hook]
Girls (Y'all are some goddamn girls)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, hah)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Verse 2]
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them
I'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dawgs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften, no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no, nope
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin' off me
I'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say, "Fuck Christina!",  he says, "Fuck Christina!", but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up, punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin'!
And fuck Bizkit! 'Cause I know you're sayin', "Fuck D12!"
Only not to our face, under your breath to yourselves
Little ...

[Hook]
Girls (Motherfuckin' females)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know the truth)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentley's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Outro]
And that's it, that's all there is to it, dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin' MTV talkin' about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford, dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now, I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up-shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Ready or not here we come, here comes trouble in the club
11, 12, 13, pistols big as M-16's
How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans?
Nina, two ninas, a piece, they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one
They're gonna think it's machine guns
Vandals-vo-vandals, bananas and old flannels
Hands around our Colt handles, hold them like roman candles
So ban us, go ban us, banana-fanna-fo-fannas
Who come back all bananas, banana clips loaded
Managers, bouncers, and the club owners
The motherfuckers don't want us to come up, bum rush in the club
And run up in it with a bunch of motherfuckers from Runyan
Steady popping them onions
Ready, set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit, just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mix coke with coconut rum up
So, yeah, yeah, ho, what up, see my people posted up
See you talk that ho shit now, when you're down you won't get up
And can't sit up you're so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater-no-heater, automatic-no-matic
Mag or no mag, it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know when I'm packing so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass
You don't wanna chance to risk it, no biscuit
Milli mac or mac milli
Will he, won't he, don't be silly, homie you don't know me really
You're just gonna make yourself dizzy wondering what the dilly
Fuck it, let's just get busy D-Twizzy's back in the hizzy!

[Hook: Eminem]
Git up now! Let's get it cracking, yeah, it's on and popping
Bitch, D12 is back in this bitch, ugh! There ain't no stopping
We're gonna get it crackalating, what you waiting for?
The wait is over, say no more
Quit tryna play the wall and quit hating
Git up now! Y'all are still sitting? What the fuck, are you deaf?
You motherfuckers don't listen I said
We 'bout to get this motherfucker crackalating
Quit procrastinating
What the fuck you waiting for? Get off the wall and quit hating, bitch
Git up now!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I keep a shitload of bullets, I pitbull it to pull it out
And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth get closed
Permanently, you get burned to line quickly
You can not hit me niggas, too terrified to come get me
Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run
When the reaper comes, the repercussion gon' equal blood
Nigga what? Stepping without a weapon, you leave, you gone
I be still rolling with stolen toasters while on parole
Snatch you out our home like eviction notices ho
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wickedest scroll ever told
When I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now it's been proven it's about to be a misunderstanding
And furniture moving, bullets flying, lawyers and mothers suing
Cause niggas don't know the difference
You bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickening, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction, riffing it
Gripping the pump
And who want to fuck with a walking psychopathic pyromaniac
Shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst
And since you jumping in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something bigger and versatile
So run and record you verses now while you got a mouth
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my acquittal
And a Glock that you will stop you from walking
Bullets'll hit your liver, I'll even shoot Native Americans
A Indian giver, and nigga
We back in your life and back in your wife
Hit you in your back with a knife and get it cracking tonight

[Hook: Eminem]
Git up now! Let's get it cracking, yeah, it's on and popping
Bitch, D12 is back in this bitch, ugh! There ain't no stopping
We're gonna get it crackalating, what you waiting for?
The wait is over, say no more
Quit tryna play the wall and quit hating
Git up now! Y'all are still sitting? What the fuck, are you deaf?
You motherfuckers don't listen I said
We 'bout to get this motherfucker crackalating
Quit procrastinating
What the fuck you waiting for? Get off the wall and quit hating, bitch
Git up now!

[Outro: Bizarre aka Peter S. Bizarre]
Hahaha, Yeah, D12, we baaack
Haha, (Get up now!) Hahahaha
Runyan Ave soldiers, Amityville
Who the fuck want it with us?
Hu-HAW!
Nobody



[Verse 1: Eminem]
My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's liver when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball and I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You probably got stripped, you wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley come on I'm hard, guard me
Ain’t booin’, ain’t pursuin’, no lawsuits, I ain’t suin’
I know what I’m doin’, give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed, I remind me the spirit of Proof
I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
LeBron sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I get the crowd rolled up Like a U-Haul truck
Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and we're going all the way
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Outro: Eminem]
We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
I said we get everybody involved homie,we get everybody involved
Yeah
Ahh
I said ahh
Give me the ball
You gotta walk before you crawl
Tell me you ain't listenin
This is Detroit basketball Homie, hey yo
Beam me up Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa



[Intro]
And I’m willing to borrow your grass
But I specialize in eating MC's
In the immortal words of LL Cool J
As he would say: "I'm a G.O.A.T.!"
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 1]
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage
Inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know I got a lot up
In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters
Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them
Than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best
And that he's the only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me
One of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 2]
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady
If they think it's gonna happen, man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong
And they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white
‘Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right?
And it's so sad ‘cause he's dope, right?
America's next great white hope, right?
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right?
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white
And the best golfer's black?"
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide
So I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? — "No."
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look
If they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Outro]
Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home
Man, shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball
‘Cause I'm a G.O.A.T.
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T.
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much
To everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
‘Cause I know that you know that I know
That you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T.
I'm out y'all, it's been real—peace!



[Verse 1]
Awaiting my response I ain’t gone just yet
It’s a long way before my car will stop and dread
I won’t park unless I finished the job I led
I promise I’ll come back harder than ever
I’m a dog but I’m not the one to guard and fetch
I’m the opposite I’ll go bark and sketch a plot
Against the robber who barged in set
Now my thoughts are headed in the wrong direction
Your goals so low ain’t got no bar to set
And it’s oh so cold you gon’ starve to death
Sharp ain’t a metaphor I chop and shred
The race ain’t over yet you claim you got the bread
You should thank me man I bring the spark in men
If this is an argument, you just lost again
You only know me as a person who you saw as a friend
You ain’t never seen the Godfather yet man

[Verse 2]
I don’t need gold to go start a trend
You don’t have an edge even with the sharpest pen
Regardless of who’s finna cross the end
I’m the boss inevitably I’m blossoming
You’ve made another song you think you marked a dent
It’s no attack in reality my heart feels blessed
And I crave competition bring it on my friend
You aim at me then I guess I am your target then

[Verse 3]
Now I did this with a reason ain’t no profiting
When I’m talking respect my conglomerate
From the tone of your voice I see you are depressed
Go to the doctor don’t act like you’ve been popping meth
I would never have the intent to harm unless
You falsely express yourself beyond extent
All you said was nearly all a stretch
You been climbing in the wrong ladder watch your step

[Verse 4]
It was clearly discreet in my speech and actions
That this ain’t no beef it’s just me who’s rapping
I believe you can’t see go get some reading glasses
Cause you’re easily offended by your key distraction
The only way you’ll beat me or meet my standards
Is paying close attention in your english classes
There will be a time where you gon’ meet me after
The way you’ll address me will be “greetings master”
I don’t steal the beats it’s called a remix asshole
Whoops sorry man I didn’t mean to use bad words
I’m navigating through your mind like a CT scanner
Piece by piece I’ll go deep in your planner
And leave your body completely shattered
A complete disaster now I’ll leave you stranded
Memories are flashing now you’re here and it’s happening
I ain’t Slim Shady I’m just a seed he planted
I ain’t MGK you perceived it backwards
Even the rats will tell you to clean your act up
Obedience that’s not something they teach in class and
Just know you can’t foresee the end before reading my chapter

[Verse 5]
My every lyric spitted got an inner meaning in it
Forbidden spit the formidable been bitten by villains
I obliterate any inconsiderate idiot living
This an infinite warfare I’m not restricted by limits
You’ve said lies go rinse your mouth with the bleachers
Jesus Christ how do I describe the features
Of this weakling who hardly has the feet to reach up
This is your epiphany now come plead to this genius

[Verse 6]
Yeah I did my annotations so that people could see
I’m superior lyrically and you’re way beneath me
Your words are squashed in between like a washing machine
When you read between my lines a horoscope appears
I’ll forecast defeat before you open your screen
I’ve slain many Mc’s before you were here
I entertain my enemies while they shiver in fear
You ain’t the first muttonhead to be coming at me
Just know the lion comes single when he hunts for his meat
Last week I got recognized by RapTV
My heart is steel I’m the real deal reel my flashback
You a prick acting like I stuck a needle up your asscrack
I’m an underground thug I could handle grenades
It’s so sad your redemption only lasted a day

[Verse 7]
Battle’s delayed bastard you’ll never surpass my display
You a dime dropper I’m standing here laughing and saying
That you ain’t gonna make it past my array
You don’t have enough praise to come back at me late
Go to sleep no wake up you’ve been dreaming this nonsense
I don’t regret what I did no guilty conscience
Self esteem not ego is what we don’t have in common
I could freestyle better if this was even a contest

[Verse 8]
You a master in what ranting and babbling junk
Don’t call yourself a rapper just by adding a cuss
I’m a PhD in this while you a crap in the mud
Go grab your keys and scram and leave the rapping to us
You spit a half a minute more but that don’t matter as much
Because it’s the message sent that attacks and it rubs
All over you like rashes it attaches like pus
I could snap my fingers and you’ll be catching the bus
Your song was good but I’m clapping my hands only once
This ain’t a massive attack it’s just a candle I touched
You trying to provoke me and make a pacifist budge
Your rhymes are trash while mines are worth a platinum budget
You brag about having more rapid slap when you punch
You don’t remember what happened in the rap battle at lunch
You’re just taking my words regurgitating it back
While I’m just being a true player stating the facts



[Intro: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the [motherfuckin'] kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Look so ridiculous now, look so ridiculous now
Look so ridiculous now, make you look so ridiculous now
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

[Verse 2: Groove Coverage]
Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last

[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, there goes gravity
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo!

[Interlude: Eminem]
One shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My [faggot] father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just [fuckin'] wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest [shit] I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da [killed him, shit], I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

[Verse 5: Eminem]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now...

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
It's the fo' pound bandit
The coke hand to hand, and he Detroit bredded
Goddanmit O Trice's back
And Oh, they so adamant I'm still at it
You should see the grill on a faggot if only looks could kill
But O is so accurate over this Mathers track
It's never inadequate I swear these haters need to chill
It's SO automatic that he is above average
Jesus of Nazareth's reached his soul and so
He is a talent that has managed to mechanically use a pen and a pad and the alphabet to get ahead
Niggas mad cuz he single handledly getting this bread
Bitches is in his bed, bullet still in his head
I'm back, fully loaded I'm ready to let off lead
Metal is heavy and I'm ready to let it all rip
The return of the vigilante on that big party and bullshit
You dig? The kid's back you biatch

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now...

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
I don't suffer the whispers of these envious niggas
Mad cuz his nuts not in my denim
Wanna be him so much they send slugs to kill him
And keep it on the hush not to become a victim
Vicious, niggas I rid them
I spit, piss on the statistics on that bullshit
I pull up muzzle yell, send the bezel berg back to here
I'mma thug, I'mma clap him till he fail and he fall
I'mma ball, I'm a beast, I'm the streets
I'm the reason you a broad, I'mma boss, I'm me
Obie bout that change, get rich fast
The Claude Van Damme of the game: Kick ass
Trapped until a nigg get out of 'Caine
And bounce back like whiplashes
And dump my cigar ashes on you asses
It's still Trice and Mathers all that matters
Call that other madness, past us
This is passion

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now...

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
My feet up, I read up
Read up on a MC who fordid, a overachiever
My Visa tease them in that villa overseas in that B1W with mamacita
G'd up, Jesus my cheese keep reaching up
Planted the seed and then it beamed up
The bean stalk being tall
Now I'm balling on these motherfucking peanuts
Huh, the demons wanna deliver me
Wanna deem him less than enemy but O too slippery
But back on you faggots nigga ain't no sympathy
I don't fuck with you actors I do mine differently
Trice made history, now all these fake niggas wanna mention me
Couldn't wait till I break in this with my entity
It don't even interest me, I'mma keep my energy spitting
Obie is in this to win this and that's the ending

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now...



[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lately I really feel like I'm rollin' for delf
Like Philly, feel like I'm losin' control of myself
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin'
And I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin'? I am finally realizin' I need
Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs goin' through peaks
And valleys, dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here,  I'm hatin' my reflection
I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah I look fat
But what do I care? I give a fuck
Only thing I fear's Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes, that I might see her... shit

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle? Get up
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that, he wouldn't fuckin'
Shoot at nobody, he'd fight first, but dwellin'
On it only makes the night worse, now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs
And Methadone pills, "Yeah, Em, tight verse
You killed it!" Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then—

[Chorus: Eminem (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes

[Verse 3: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
My friends can't understand this new me, that's understandable
Man, but think how bananas you'd be, you'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the
First tour; the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
"Daddy, don't you die on me! Daddy, better hold your ground!"
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down (Daddy!)

[Chorus: Eminem, Hailie Jade (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) (Daddy!) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I woulda never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours — yes, it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm—

[Chorus: Eminem (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes



[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Oy yeah
Beautiful
I remember it like it just happened
I could've sworn it was a dream
But in reality it hit me like a nightmare
Or at least that's how it seemed
I just got a grip on our relationship
We was ironing things out, started picking up steam
And when we didn't need it is when it all got heated
And we both said some things that we probably didn't mean
Then God intervened, guess more was at stake
Thought we left nothing over, he put more on the plate
She came home from the doctor with news I've been wanting
Says family was incoming, she's pregnant, twins coming
But that's gotta be a lie
She sighed, couldn't stop the tears coming from her eyes
That birth control she on, for them it's suicide
As long as it's still inside, two of them wouldn't survive
Hard turn from memorable to cynical
Picturing clothes for what would've been identical
Similar outfits, similar names
My deceased kids' ultrasound in a frame
So I'm deprived of my chance to be a better dad
Staring at my twins that I never had
I shed a tear, looking up in the sky
Even though y'all just got here, goodbye

[Hook: Ming]
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
My biological sperm donor, didn't wanna be a daddy
So he hopped in his Caddy and turned corners on us
Turned on us out the clear blue
His last memory of his son is seeing me through his rearview
I still love him yo, but I love his brother more
My uncle showed me love no one could know
Young and poor with a tougher road
To suffer hunger was nothing but Unc' would hold
Us down, help moms lift the motherload
I got grown and
I used to wonder what it would be like to speak to pops as a grown man
He provided that feeling, told me to take my career into my own hands
He was there when I had no fans
My cellphone rings, and after I answer
A voice says "Your uncle's been diagnosed with cancer"
Worst news in my life
Him and chemo going 12 rounds with a disease and they're both losing the fight
I'm rushing up to Cedars-Sinai
Praying for a miracle, I don't wanna see my idol die
Before he did, the look in his eyes
Said "Even though you just got here, goodbye"

[Hook: Ming]
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

[Bridge: Ming]
I'll see you again in the afterlife
Someday in heaven we will reunite
The flesh disappears but the soul survives
Till next time, my friend, farewell, goodbye

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I walked in your daughter's house, knowing that you gone
But still looking out the corner of my eye, hoping you're on the couch
That call felt like I was beef that had got shot up
Ironic, I was on tour with Tech N9ne and Slaughterhouse
D tried to talk to me, Crystal rubbed my back, as they was pouring out
I caught the next thing soaring out
Now I'm in the air, in the midwest somewhere
They said turbulence was severe, I don't know what they talking bout
I ain't feel a bump, body numb, mind drifting
I'm sniffling, asthma acting up, I'm whistling
I'm wishing my mother's face looked so much different
I'm kissing my son, my aunt pacing in the kitchen
My vision blurry, still I saw your face clear
What a loss, this time I did more than waste beer
Michelle's strong, she held on, we got all the way there
Then we walked in, she fell on the floor, this ain't fair
You was the voice when I considered them thoughts that ain't clear
Hey granny, I was fifth row at the Grammy's
An award they ain't hand me, but I sat behind Will
And right in front of Wayne, and got seen by the family
I miss the early morning convos, believe me
Regis on the TV, and the best baked ziti
But you had an all white affair, grandpa's all fly
Even though you been got there, goodbye

[Hook: Ming]
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife



[Intro]
Dawg, I shouldn't have left
They wouldn't have tried that shit if I was with you
Maybe he would've picked another time or maybe chose another way
Or maybe my prayers would've convinced him to choose another soul
Shit, it's just me, mom and Tony now
Man, you look so peaceful right now
How can I argue with that?
They say that the good die young

[Hook: Kon Artis]
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (uh)
In this life cause, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
I'm sure that everybody heard their momma say there'd be days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the mist
In the struggle, into the circumstances
A risk that they take, just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen
To any man or woman that's dumb enough to pretend
Huh, God will hold them accountable for sins
That they commit and they try to repent the sins to repent
But I guess that's the way things go
I was blessed to see twenty-four
To wake up to that "Hi, My Name Is" video
Motivated me to write what I wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
And mom and daddy wanted to move our row
I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show
I just wish we ain't have to lose Bugz to the struggle
Cause you know

[Hook: Kon Artis]
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (uh)
In this life cause, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I know you used to Bizarre on some silly shit
But niggas in my clique, is dying quick (for real)
In Detroit, niggas don't party
They pull a fo'-fo' out, snatch off yo Carti's
That's why I keep the pistol under the truck
I'm 27 years old, too old to be getting jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts
B-U-G-Z, tatted on my wrist
Me and you in the Jeep, listen to screamo beats
It's a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is Dee
Peace to 31, and 5150 I miss you

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I think back on that tragic day my phone rung
And Bizarre's voice telling me Bugz was going home
It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breathe
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear, at his wake, dawg I cried so hard
Literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now, it's tearing me apart
But I had to let it out cause it was tearing at my heart
Cause he died over something so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious, I hope y'all
Understand how I'm feeling cause I love you Bugz
I wanna rhyme with you, laugh with you, hug you Bugz
But I can't, and you were so close to see your dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track as just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
Cause you know

[Hook: Kon Artis]
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (uh)
In this life cause, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home

[Verse 4: Proof]
They say it's never too late to have an early childhood
If I could turn back the hands of time, God should
Forgive what I did as a kid that run blocks
Now my dreams is just screams, cops and gunshots
The fun stops when your homies up in the box
My doody Bo, bless his soul, snuffed by the cops
I used to question a lot, if there's a God around me say something
If you love us so much why ain't you gave nothing?
When he took my homie Snook was only in eleventh grade
Now I hope to see his face at the Heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, Satan remains
With a grudge to see slugs break through my frame
My heart aches with the pain, and life limits breath
We got to have fun now, there's only minutes left
And in death cause stress younguns is sucked in
To get tats for my fallen homies? I ain't got enough skin
Miss y'all!

[Hook: Kon Artis]
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (uh)
In this life cause, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home

[Verse 5: Swift]
When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise
That crashed and the driver died, my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride, that the other two survived
Nine months later, another one dies
Somebody shot him in his side when he was starting up his ride
Three years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when Funky got done, Joey playing with guns
And Tookie over funds, Cardie was my man
And Reggie, I wish that I was with you in that van
And Bugz, if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standing in this booth
And that's the truth, I miss y'all

[Hook: Kon Artis]
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (uh)
In this life cause, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (uh)
In this life cause, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home



[Verse: Eminem]
Here we go aga-ain, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still, it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in a E-N-V-elope
Would be dope, but what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in, I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's prob'ly screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been!"
"And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him."
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like when
You get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!"
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since—

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
Play like you're the good guy
Play like, play like,  play like you're the good guy



[Verso: Eminem]
Aquí vamos de nuevo, de héroes a villanos
Solía ​​ser tu Romeo pero ambos estábamos abandonados
Un par de veces, por lo que tuvimos una pendiente resbaladiza para hacer frente a
Pero aún así, me dio la esperanza de que obtendremos
A través de ella, un lóbulo cortado
Enviado a usted en un S-O-B-re
Sería drogadicto, pero ¿a qué tipo de longitud puedes ir?
Tire de un Vincent van Gogh, solo para convencer a un maldito ho
Ser una ama de casa que miente abiertamente
Ella está borracha, ahora está de vuelta en mi camino
Salí corriendo, ¿por qué está intentando actuar?
Ella es casi de mi tamaño, me golpeó en la boca dos veces
Chicos, cuando alguien por quien morirías
Pega un cuchillo de carne en tu corazón, ¿intentas más?
Otra tarde en la noche, ella tropieza a través de mi puerta
Deja entrar la luz del día y todo lo que hacemos es luchar más
Y no soy violenta, pero ella está revisando mis cajones
Para plantar el K-Y, una puta me está acusando
Quien huele a San Ides y quien probablemente haya jodido cinco mas
Chicos, chuparon ocho / nueve hombres
Me llevo dos por cuatro a nuestro ocho por diez
Perra, eres tú, arranqué el marco, gano
Poner un nuevo puntaje alto, venció a este juego en el que estoy
Y aquí hay algunos de dos capas para cuando salgas con mis amigos
Para limpiarte el culo cuando moviste tus entrañas
Cuando renovamos nuestros votos, este es el agradecimiento que recibo?
Estoy esperando el día que pueda
Te oigo decir: "Marshall, ¡qué gilipollas he sido!
Y hay un chico nuevo, estás siendo reemplazado por él "
Tengo sus tubos atados para él, tengo ese trabajo de tetas para él
Me duele hasta la médula, pero el dolor en el que estoy
Después de ti, juré hacer cesar los cielos grises
Aquí vienen los rayos, como cuando se obtiene una subida de sueldo y
¿Soy el chico bueno o solo juego como él?
¿Y espero que te deje?
Es como un sueño hecho realidad, solo para gritar "¡Vete a la mierda!"
Supongo que tomas la vida de la misma manera que juegas dados
Porque solo me miras y les pones los ojitos de serpiente
Ya que-

[Coro: Jessie Reyez]
Desde que compraste el jurado, me llamarán culpable
Me van a llamar culpable
Usted compró el jurado, me llamarán culpable
Aunque sabes el verdadero yo
No puedes vencer a un tramposo, convence a un no creyente

[Verse: Eminem]
I done figured this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
To my success I've murked for me-uh... (slurs words) repeatedly
(Laughter and slurs words) to beat MCs
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts in
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
It seems to just be no one left to bully, Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Bush is bushy
Ain't shit going on, shit I been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin' of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth I like the shit better then
Shit I can spit better, I'm bout to kick that shi-shit again
Look, the game just ain't the same, it's changin'
Shit Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin', now it's just wanksta
Sayin' the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
It's makin' me so bored I'ma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, ubbu you ubbu ooba
Yooba can subba my dibidick through a tubba
Suma newma lama, I'm not a human
I'm a suicidal super sonic suicidal uni-bomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press think I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on, uh
Lotta talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip-hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us

[Hook: Proof]

Scratching:
"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -] Mr. Garrison

Verse One [Eminem]:
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom wouldn't take me
The bitch still hates me
Shit, one day she said, "Go rake leaves,"
I said, "Make me!"
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house
For making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fuckin' pricks!

Scratching:

"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -] Mr. Garrison

Verse Two [Obie Trice]:
How the fuck you gonna fuck with O Trice with a staff full of hoes
With one gat and a wack stack of flows?
A whole lot of lip
Thicker than Obie's shit
Oh shit they found your ass floatin' in the ocean
Body part corroded
Cast away
You stretched in a cast today
That's how a real bastard play
Do shit the bachelor way
Creek niggas will blast away
Y'all niggas ain't tough
Y'all niggas funny
Y'all need to roll on WB 20
Niggas think they 2Pacalypse Now
Until they catch a buckshot
Chicken pop a nigga's style
Niggas scared of the firm
Slim, Dirty Dozen and Trice
Come back like thieves in the night
Niggas jump, that's reason to fight
That's reason to rearrange your teeth with the right
Motherfucker



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently; you're just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be
Enemies as long as we breathe, I don't ever see
Either of us comin' to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak-a Inglés
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need 15 of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein' you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me! Pick me up, throw me!
Lift me up, hold me—just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We got you niggas nervous, on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MC's
You's worthless, you's not them G's
You's a circus, you's no appeal, please
You's curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred
In two-thousand-third: you's perpin'
You's no threat, who's you servin'?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady, mothafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 3: DMX]
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin' New York with the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk with my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm movin', peep where I'm goin'
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growin', gettin' larger than life
Easy goin' with the same one that started the fight
He be knowin' how dog get when dog don't bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'Cause it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla but couldn't holla back
Now they got to swallow everything in the sack
Blood Line, and we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Outro: Eminem]
All you motherfuckers, take that!
Here, take this too, bitch!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead
All of you! Fake-ass gangsters!
No more press! No more press!
Rot, motherfuckers, rot!
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfuckin' dirt!
Die nameless, bitch! Die nameless!
No more fame! Ahh, hahahaha
Yo, X, come on, man! Obie, let's go! Ha ha



Woo!
Damn
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?

[Verse 1]
Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more Focus Hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite her to "Cheers"
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player who's working with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait
Let's escalate to the nearest Super 8
And see your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
C'mon

[Refrain]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 2]
Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
She caught me starin
And my homies darin me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla cause I got a lot of dinerio
The DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't wanna be headin home
With some double Ds full of silicon
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Cussin at the bitches screamin "off to they rides!"

[Refrain]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huhh)
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 3]
Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally, like a box of Cheerios
Cherry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
(feet running away noise)
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes

[Bridge]
Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Opera and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

[Refrain]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Outro]
Haha, haha, ha
You gotta have teeth baby
It just wouldn't look right
Look, me big lips
You no teeth, it wouldn't work
You know what I'm sayin'
Haha ha, yeah
I'm feelin' good
Shady Records man
Obie Trice
C'mon



[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin’ I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin’ dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause damn it I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's-snot gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips got the cig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Prr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest



[Intro: Eminem]
What would it take to push a man
Far enough to put something material over a human life
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that for green and gold

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I done filled my lungs up with so much of this Crack smoke
My neck's bloated, my tech's loaded I'm flat broke and I'm pissed off
Mad at the world I've had it with girls and I'm frustrated
Ran to the bus stop just made it and hopped on
Ready to drop bombs on the first person
Who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot John white collar worker in clean cut
Walked up to him, he's like "What?"
What you mean "What?"
You know what time it is man
At your next stop gimme that rolex watch
With that diamond wristband
Got his green and his gold dashed and climbed in this van
To steal it and seen a man holding a nine in his hand
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Fucked around and forgot that I left my ID on the seat

[Verse 2: Vesuveo]
Your arrival, want survival, but is you fit?
Your arrival, want survival, but is you fit?
I'm rising with the sun
Synthesized with the universal
I'm goin' to be a better man and this be my rehearsal
For the future, this your game
Make a name to get the fame and the dame
Forget the same as everybody who came
Before it's simple and plain
You be a mere facsimile
Fallen like Gallipoli
Thinking y'all from Italy
But I'm the goumba and I'm working hard at my craft
Great grandpa carried concrete up a shaft
What did you laugh? Huh? Yeah you
You think it's funny raising 14 kids
Without no books, without no money
Ma got honey, funny thing it's that you think you're seeing me
A mere reflection in the mirror here I come I'm getting nearer
Coming even closer can you feel a realer presence in your being?
We inside lyrical ride and I advise you now you're seeing
A true seer never fear cause I'm here in your midst forever
Cleverly helping you better see yourself that be my gist
Open fisted let my energy flow we good to go
It's Able bodied, Mr. Zinn, Vesuveo Survivor Soul
Watch 'em fold hold the gold smoke the green gimme the gravy
Give it up don't give a fuck like Slim Shady

[Hook: Vesuveo & Able]
Between you and me I can see in yo eyes
Wise to the next stay in checkmate
Getcha your Green getcha Gold
It come between me and you
Will lost getcha gold heaven hold getcha green
'Tween you and me I can see in yo eyes
Wise to the next stay in checkmate
Getcha your Green getcha Gold
It come between me and you
Will die sold a soul for green and gold now say goodbye
Should I ever live to fulfill this dream
Would I ever kill for the life of the team?
If I ever came between you and the green
Who's the fiend? By any necessary means

[Verse 3: Able]
I chase a dream that's deep like space
To conquer then escape from this place without a trace
But I await to face personal mercenaries
Bounty hunters wanna check me for my nickel bags
I'll be smoking 'til my eyes bleed: red
Meet me if you can then proceed ahead
Reach for what you need now
No time to think just move and react
Who you gonna call when the wall is at your back?
Trying to blitzkrieg me for the sack
Fiends better believe me sure as I breathe
Their teams be getting touched back
Rush me and I cut back the rumor that you only live once
Let's put it to the test so we can live like legends
Down to hold the line like Selassie
Hold the seventh seal of heaven every time
If a subtleties committed somebody fumbled the dime
Winners guzzle the wine I smuggle mine with them
But he who has the whole nine
Will always double down and play for ten
These are the rules adversaries stayin' cool
Shooting glances like pool
While you dying for the change
I'm changing for the principle
Mystical rebel soul in the physical
Behold the gold but don't fold for the green
Untold best unkept secret unseen
A king should only tell his queen one thing
The light sleeper is the keeper of the team
But keep it between you and me

[Hook]



[Intro]
50 Cent, Shady, Aftermath, the dream team
We gotta get the get well cards, niggas is sick
Feel this, nonstop
Motion picture shit, haha

[Verse]
Now don't think I won't hit you cause I'm popular
I got a P-90 Reuger to pop at cha
Catch ya slippin' I'mma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded wit' 16 shots for ya
Never had a hot gun on your waist and blood on your shoe
Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you?
Homie you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me and I'm not like you
I'm like a animal wit' it when I spit it it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryina play me
One shot is not enough you need least an Uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start feelin' woozy
I write my life you write what you seen in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me
I found my space at the top I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spray shells through your convertible
Lotus, you notice?
Rich or poor hollows still go through your door, this is war
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back
50 Cent, I know you like that
Yeah I know you like that

[Outro]
Green Lantern
Shady Records
Anger Management Tour, homie
Yeah



Met a retarded kid name Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
Fuck an acid tab, I strapped the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited 'til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!



[Hook: Notorious B.I.G. sample]
"I grew up a fucking screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fucking blew up"

[Intro: Ludacris speaking over B.I.G. sample repeated]
Yeah! Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!
Yeah! Grew up a screw up baby
Got introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet
Let's go!

[Ludacris]
Ever since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said, "Wake up and kick out!"
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out
Peace up, A-Town down and then I dipped out
And oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out
Somebody get him, the little nigga's out of control
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold
Gold gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen
Freshing freshing, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan
And I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy over the Hook]
Ayyyy
Y'all already know what it is
I'mma tell you nigga
C.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5

[Young Jeezy]
Homey fronted me a zip, shit I made it a bird
That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word
Say the, ice is cool but them pots is hot
You better cook slow but that money come fast
I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash
You know the kid pimping all over the world
A hundred carats got me all over your girl
YEAH, five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag
A corporate thug, I run with a Playaz Circle
I got a Field Mob that'll Disturb your Peace
Blowing Sean Jay, all we do is smoke
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head
What's up?

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I'mma be all the way real with this, look
When I came into the game they ain't do nothing but doubt me
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothing without me
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips, but harder
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK! Guard your
Women dawg I went from ashy to classy
Went from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you're playing your cards
Boy!

[Hook]



[Intro]
"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare."

[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitchin’, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion

[Interlude]
"I remember it clearly, even today."

[Verse 2]
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final manoeuvre to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent

[Interlude]
"Carved an underground empire."

[Verse 3]
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off its oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka

[Interlude]
"That you'll not escape my vengeance."

[Verse 4]
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit

[Interlude]
"And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed..."

[Hook]
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head

[Bridge]
I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day!

[Outro]
"I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing."



[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Skit: Stan, Girl]
Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

[Interlude: The Isley Brothers, Mark Avery, (Grady), & Grady's Wife]
Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her? She's passed out
It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
Then pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch at her mom and dad's house
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)
You wanna get hauled off to jail?
Bump that, drop her off, ring the doorbell, then bail

What, she tripped, fell, landed on his ****?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?
Kick her our the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?

(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail



[Ca$his]
Yeah
It's Ca$his, I'm comin, uhh
Shady Records niggas, GO!

[Verse 1]
Walkin, with a semi cocked, flip down any block
Get cash, plenty guap, talk hard gettin shot
Went to war with the cops, you reach for what I got
Treat you like Singapore, swing a sword, you are chopped
Picture me pistol-free, "Look at me, look at me"
And realizing none of y'all is hood as me
That's on e'rythang, take six to your frame
Your son caught in strays, he gon' die any day
Try and act brave, tell the law my name
I bet your family won't live to see another day
There is no other way, you hearin what I say
I got paper now, I can fight the case

[Hook: Ca$his]
I'm walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule
Walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule

[Verse 2]
Like Iraq, C-4 in backpacks
You can pull straps but you can't match that
Thought you was lord of shit bitch, why you let him snitch?
Put the gun in your hand, now we can settle it
Put it up, to his head, I can't do it for ya
You, be the trigger man, kill your own brother
See, how it feels when he drops, and he bleeds
I handed you heat, it was your op-tion to squeeze
Drop, to your knees, look at me, and believe
There's only one way to get out of this thing
Barrel aimed at your face, cock back, fire straight
Now at least neither one of us'll catch a murder case

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Flyin down the 5, flicked out, gettin high
Jump off on Lincoln, roll through, Anaheim
Rush, of a homicide, races, through my mind
Not commit, any crime anywhere, anytime
Stick, niggas for they shine, yeah, you been on the grind
Yeah, take your jewelry off and pass it to me, it's mine
Cohort, me and my cohorts on codeine
Conspire and rioting, robbin niggas for more cream
Step on work, eighth by eighth
Six points off a quarter nigga, stretch that cake
I ain't chillin on the corner, you fall in your order
For eightballs and nope, I ain't holdin nothin short, yeah

[Hook]

[Outro]
We live by gun rule!
Shady Records nigga
I'm ridin through to Annis{?}
With my forks up folk, G's up!



[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
"Do I really belong in this game?", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You,” ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear







[Intro]
Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
‘Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
‘Cause sometimes (Fuck) it feels like (I was scared) the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and—

[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​



[Intro: Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12-gauge shotty (Feel me!) (Come get me)
And Ja said he shall be (Motherfuckers if you want Shady)
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac (If Pac was still here now)
To lead this industry into the ways of the man (He would never ride with Ja)
Follow me! (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Keep my mesh vest as Pac's vest

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you motherfuckers want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearin' rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted
In The Source, stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to God, hopin' no one's listenin'
See 50 comin' for me, oh my god ma—my position
No one'll pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
And now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin' madman who screams
Like I'm Pac, but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin' motherfuckers names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucker

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
Motherfucker if you want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Get off that E
Before you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit motherfucker, we ballin'
Catch me countin' cheese and when I'm callin', can you accept my call
CEO let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckers thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talkin' 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin' bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, you's a motherfuckin' punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scarin' them fuckin' kids with your ugly ass mug (Ha-ha-ha)
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don’t play that
All these old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man (Ha-ha)
Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryna play hate on my shit, man, eat a fat dick
Lovin' this shit that's how you made me
Feelin' like I got you niggas crazy (Huh-uh)
Against all odds, hopin' my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involvin' me for
It's been a long time comin', like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an imposter
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc. roster
Dumb ass, now who's shootin'? Ah made you look
You said Bus singin' the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shootin', I take a look at your man
The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga start adjustin' your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate tryin' to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't tryin' to repeat this
Just cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Oh shit, it was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue, homie
Now I'ma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
One

[50 Cent]
Hahaha, BITCH! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac, motherfucker, hahaha
2Pac shoes too big for you to walk in you lil' faggot, hahaha

(What do we have here now?)



[1. Part]
Ey, ey/
Ich zerfetze diesen pep-ziehenden Kek  mit Hits/
Du bist du so whack du bist nach sechs Siegen noch Entry, bitch/
Hörer woll‘n lieber Don Sonic dem Baba bleiben/
Denn ich halt sie bei der Stange wie Hantelscheiben/
AntiC hört meinen Text und will sich drüber den Kopf zerbrechen/
Und weil ich ihm dabei helfen will werd ich seinen Kopf zerbrechen/
Ey der lyrische Boss ist Back/
Und wird jetzt dein Entführer/
Obwohl du Penner zart besaitet bist wie Pergament-Bücher/
Battleraps Führer/
Du triffst nicht mal den Takt richtig/
Was Bitch, ich/
Dachte echt/
Das hier wär krass schwierig/
Aber allmählich/
Kursiert hier das Gerücht/
Dass dieser Don Sonic ganz easy AntiC fickt/
Deine besten Freunde heißen Siegfried und Roy/
Man merkt schon nach nur einigen Bars ihr drei seid ziemliche Toys/
Du willst musizieren doch deine Runde klingt die ganze Zeit nur offbeat -sogar wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft/
Ey ich gebe Gas, man/
Komm mit mit fetten MGs aus Stahl/
Und wenn ich den Penner mit Schlägen drapiere beißt er dann in‘s Gras so wie Vegetarier/
Du Lappen/
Hörst du‘s aus dem Schlafzimmer „Rumm!“ machen/
Bin ich mit ziemlicher Sicherheit da grad am rummachen/

[Hook]
Spast ich bin/
Der Beste/
Also was soll die-/
-ses Battle/
Eyo AntiC, flieh/
Und Bettel/
Du hast Angst und sprichst/
Hail Mary/
Spast ich bin/
Der Beste/
Was soll die-/
-ses Battle/
(Sag mir was)
Sonic der Messias ist da/
Da, dadada dada dada/

[2. Part]
Obacht, weil jetzt der Münchner dich unterjocht/
Du rappst - denn du musst über die Runden kommen/
Doch dieses Battle wird traumatisch - du musst über die Runden kommen/
Meine Runden sind so geil man könnt über die Runden kommen/
Deine Nachbarn sind ausgezogen/
Denn du hast dich ausgezogen/ und bist  ausgezogen/ Um eine Frau für dich Lauch zu suchen/
Ey glaub dir nie im Leben dass deine Futt blasen würde/
Denn ihr Mund trägt den Spitznamen „Oralgebirge“/
Ich komm mit der Gun und zerficke den Wannabe-Rapper denn seine Music klingt nach Comedy, Penner die Arten wie ich dich zerlege sind unter aller würde/
AntiC kann nicht mal ne mp3 hochlanden
Denn er ist einfach behindert dein Girl sagt sie würd nicht unter mei‘m Schwanz liegen obwohl sie's unter aller würde/
Ich habe längst genug Bars um AntiC wegzufetzen/
Doch ich will seine komplette Existenz beenden/
Und mein Verlangen ist ihn sehr zu quälen/
Also weg du Faggot/
Denn du verlangst von mir fair zu battlen/
Jetzt ist das Match zuende/
Dein Kopf wird aufgeschlagen wie Tennisbälle/
Ich kann auch nichts dafür das du dämlicher Hund so schwul bist/
Aber du brauchst ja auch 3 Takes für ne 60 Sekunden Runde/
Wenn ich samt salutierender Männer auf der Street marschier‘/
Sorg dabei meist für mehr Debakel als Dib Akil/
Und nach dem Battle fängst du dummer Spasti an zu flennen/
Denn ich bin unbesiegbar - Kobayashi Maru Test/

[Hook]
Spast ich bin/
Der Beste/
Also was soll die-/
-ses Battle/
Eyo AntiC, flieh/
Und Bettel/
Du hast Angst und sprichst/
Hail Mary/
(2x)
Spast ich bin/
Der Beste/
Was soll die-/
-ses Battle/
(Sag mir was)
AntiC dein Untergang ist nah/
Da, dadada dada dada/

[3. Part]
Es kann passieren dass ich mal dich Wichser fick/
Und ein paar Kugeln auf grünem Baller, wie Spieler am Billardtisch/
Man fragt mich wie ich einfach immer so easy die Opfer Bang/
Ich sag ich schreib Texte auf Grünem und Weißem wie bei nem WhatsApp-Chat/
AntiC darf dem Übermenschen gleich den Cock blown/
Und fällt aus allen Wolken so wie Wesley Snipes in Drop Zone/
Bringe mit Style Vergleiche/
Und jeglicher Widerstand gegen den Mac ist zwecklos, wie meine Reime/
Beim Anblick von meinem Teil wird deine leicht bekleidete Kleine kreidebleich wie Leichenteile/
Stirb Langsam - keine Eile/
Mache Rap nur zum Zeitvertreib/
Ich zieh weiße Lines wie bei Seitenstreifen/
Deine Meinung ist mir einerlei du Haufen Scheiße/
Deine Zeit/
Ist gleich vorbei/
Ich will dich mir nichtmal einverleiben/
Dann würd ich mich selbst fressen, weil du mich kopierst kleiner biter/
Ich stehe ne Davidoff rauchend/
Abends vorm Haus/
Da kommst du Spasti grad vorbei/
Ich stippe die Asche auf dich drauf/
Und du kollabierst direkt von ihrem Gewicht denn du motherfucker bist ein gottverdammter -20 Kilo Lauch/
Und du bist dann wie nie am laufen/
Ich halt Bandenkrieg am Laufen/
Dein Flow ist wackelig wie Townships/
Meine ist andre Liga, schau Bitch/
Ich bin Don Sonic/
Trink neun Tonics/
Du Vollhonk, bist schon offbeat/
Bevor du überhaupt anfängst zu Rappen/
Du kommst hier nicht weiter Bastard/
Denn Don Sonic ist geil/Guile, wie der Streetfightercharakter/
Jetzt kommt die Hanteln hebende Hassreden anbringende Kingfigur/
Du den Takt verfehlende Kack redende ganz elende Missgeburt/
Ja, digga man Diss mich nur/
Doch nach diesem Fight bist du eine sich nur noch schwach regende, flachliegende Witzfigur/
Du bist so soft, deine Musik klingt nach Tabaluga/
Also halt die fresse sonst zücke meine Luger/
Denn das hier ist ein Stellungskrieg - Kama Sutra/
Wie willst du das hier bitte kontern ey du Bastard good luck/

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
My real name, my rap shit
No made up nigga, I'm straight up, nigga
Still in the projects where I came up, nigga
On a scaffold doing ten sets of ten, getting my weight up, nigga
I'm no shooter, but my shooters'll have your brain exposed
But I'll shoot five in a second, homie, and break your nose
Talking past, I'm dead ass, I was living
Life fast with my pistol in the grab
Digging in my ass tryna finish up the last so I can sit it in a stash
Old E. sweat dripping from the bag
Milk crates sitting on the ave
While I'm looking left and right for them niggas with the badge
My mom's dishes really had crack on 'em
12 12s and I kept that shit packed for 'em, yeah they came back for 'em
I can paint it so vivid cause I really lived it
If rap fail, I stack bail, and show you how to get it!

[Chorus Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm in the club, bottle in hand doing my two step
While I got my gun in my pants, call it the hammer dance
Bitches dancing on a nigga, when they feel the gun
I tell 'em we're doing the hammer dance
Two steppin' with my weapon on me
You good? I'm just checking, homie
Fam-a-lam, you don't stand a chance
While I got this gun in my pants doing my hammer dance

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
In these LA times, I wake up on one
House slippers and coffee, I know the paper gon' come
I drop shit that make the gangstas go dumb
Keep a bad bitch naked like my waist with no gun
I'm for real, how are you?
Got street power, from the Watts Towers to Howard Hugh
How would you become me? I don't do what you cowards do
Flip a thousand pounds of that sour dies' in a hour, dude
I'm out my muh'fuckin' mind
Fuck a punchline, salute my muh'fuckin' grind
Ditching feds on the regular, they're trying to catch a predator
Not the Chris Hansen type, but the Danny Glover kind
I'm a killer, everybody know I body yo audio
When the shotty blow say goodbye to your barrio, you maricón
You don't think that I'm about this
Ice grill, nigga, put your money where your mouth is

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm in the club, bottle in hand doing my two step
While I got my gun in my pants, call it the hammer dance
Bitches dancing on a nigga, when they feel the gun
I tell 'em we're doing the hammer dance
Two steppin' with my weapon on me
You good? I'm just checking, homie
Fam-a-lam, you don't stand a chance
While I got this gun in my pants doing my hammer dance

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
(Joey)
My real name, my rap shit
Fuck with Chase, but the real bank is the mattress
Money ain't new to me, been getting G-stacks
Since Smoove B took his shawty back from rehab
Knife work with me, but the chrome is extra
Case I'm in the same taxi as the bone collector
Y'all rappin' 'bout models, I get hounded by 'em
Not a killer at all, I'm just surrounded by 'em
Just a real nigga, straight from my mother's stomach
Ain't enough cloth for all of us to be cut from it
Not decided by who totes lead
'Cause all of us would be angels for Pujols' bread
Lot of hostility, hollering is killing me
Screaming "Over my dead body," like it's not a possibility
On my Jers' bullshit, never mind me
But if it's ever problems, niggas know where to find me

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm in the club, bottle in hand doing my two step
While I got my gun in my pants, call it the hammer dance
Bitches dancing on a nigga, when they feel the gun
I tell 'em we're doing the hammer dance
Two steppin' with my weapon on me
You good? I'm just checking, homie
Fam-a-lam, you don't stand a chance
While I got this gun in my pants doing my hammer dance



[Verse 1: Da Dough]
I ain’t tryna brag
But before I did you never used a hashtag
Already lyrically murdered so I drag
The body, hide it from subpoena
They can’t see it like Cena
And feed you to the Hyena
You say I record in a closet?
Let me hear your tape and pause it

[Interpolation: "A Man" by Alex Barzaga]
You could only understand
Back then
When nothing was grand
And everybody in the hood hated him
When and where everybody would jump him
Just for his shoes that didn't mean nothing
All they were doing was punching
And cutting
And kicking
Their heads were so sicken
And thicken
The only home they knew was a prison

[Continuing Verse 1: Da Dough]
Who’s your engineer?
Cause that shit don’t sound clear
Why you rapping about the hood you ain’t ever been near
That’s the place you fear!
How the hell you even here?
Stop using my message to sell!
Before it’s used to show how you fell!
You is off brand like Taco Dell
You wanna be Hopsin, I can tell
Anti-Drug when the beat drops in
I still ain’t hear no heat drop in
You ain’t need drugs, you already dumb as shit!
Sounding like you on Ricegum’s tit!
Bitch I have come to spit!
Ain’t nobody tryna hear you to get lit
Ain’t nobody tryna hear you for shit
You is a white kid meme kit
Out there stealing Drake's team shit
Wearing Supreme shit
So I guess you in your feelings
I don’t get who you even appealing
I’m gassed up, I’m refillable
All you rappers is killable
Hit you with a syllable
You could never body me
Call this lyrical sodomy
Hold up I ain’t done
I murder rappers for fun
I push my weight around ton
Like I ain’t got enough on my plate
I drop classics at inhuman rate
I’m in my own league, no debate
Never ran out of fatigue
Never see me coming, Blitzkrieg
You ain’t rich, you ain’t even on iTunes
Comparing numbers, nothing on my tunes
Nothing on my goons
Crash into you like the moon
I’ll be ending this soon
But first I’ll let you look like a buffoon
Been bodying you since last June
Follow for Follow
Then you unfollow
Your buzz is so hollow
Your pride you better swallow
Stop pretending like you cool with Riley
Keep his name out yo lips like Kylie
He don’t even know you, facts be highly
Stop pretending like he owe you
Stop pretending like I’m below you
Your music ain’t worth a-
Wait, what happened to Mirtha?
I can call My Mama who gave birth ya
The women who put me on earth ya
Where’s yours?
Hanging with 2 bit whores?
Getting smashed, no s’mores?
Alls fair in love and war
So I have a lot in store
Dakota & Deal used to beat your ass
Then that 27 year old fucked Ana and pass
Your whole career nobody savin'
You really threw a shot at Rayvinn?
Like that would make me cave in?
Hold up? The fuck you on tho?
Voted Republican, Alejandro?
That’s no surprise tho
Who inspired your flow?
Logic? Oh
Eminem? Oh
NF? Oh
Hov? No
All your favorites got a similar trait you know
But I guess I won’t say though
But here’s the KO
I formed your career, and I ain’t here to Play Dough

[Outro: Da Dough]
Yeah
If I come to your city, it's all love
You come to mine and it's (gunshots)
Yeah...
Pussy!



[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers, say that you're dissing you only talk about Roy’s hairline
Boys having no choice rapping annoying gay lines
Go find something else I'm kind enough to show great signs
Of emotional horror don't even try you won’t make rhymes
As great as I do later fate will tell you to don't waste time
Go play in the dirt where you'll soon be buried alive by us
With your saliva drooling and dripping hey but I ain't bias
Unlike these motherfuckers who then go and try and write lines
Thinking of linking Roy and Gabe in the same conversation
But if you start this then it'll spark a fight and a riot see
I'm a nice boy and when I heard you dissing Roy I was like
I'll whoop your ass pounding while you're screaming and shouting
Now you’re shook like you’re grounded and you're stiff as a mountain
See this is easy for me it’s like throwing coins in the fountain
I'll soon have my boys come over and have your house surrounded
I'm a smart guarding watch dog making your jaws drop astounded
See I wasn't in council i don’t know much accounting
But I do know zero is what you'd ever amount to
Spoiling this rap shit man it sounded like cow shit
Royban is a savage that he even allowed this

[Verse 2]
Since he's in a position to speak to his viewers who diss him he ain't no
Electrician but he'll fix it within a minute
Yeah see they call him a killer and if you have a doubt I'll clear it
With these ridiculed lyrics then share it and smear it in your
Motherfucking face like makeup you wear it
In your goddamn video I hear seven year olds swearing
Royban was doing great until you had to interfere him
In his work where he made a Gabe diss track that was latest
He had to show him who's greater now this new diss he created
It'll reach the top of the billboards with outstanding merits
But he's debated disputed hated and viewed in America
As a motherfucking foulmouth like you didn't experiment nah nah
That's when I start to point out sources of errors
Cause these noobs can't interpret he's pure like twenty four karat
And I tried to tell the people to not rap and be haters
Cause they sound like an old parrot I suggest you don't hear it
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't think you do
So stay tuned and keep your eyes glued to the video and
Here we go he's Roy he's here to destroy
I'm the tongue twister mister kiss my ass it's just a
[Hook x2]
Hand grenade never been afraid to diss Gabe on his
Song and always throwing bombs all day he's just a
Hand grenade never been afraid to slaughter men
On his way on his way on his way on his way

Hand grenade never been afraid to diss Gabe on his
Song and always throwing bombs all day he's just a
Hand grenade never been afraid to slaughter men
On his way on his way on his way on his way

[Verse 3]
He had to hustle his back to his walls sagging muscles
He's jacked but he had to hit the gym kick his shins
Pick his things he's innocent so I had to kick the living shit
Out of y'all cause man you just can't stop dissing him
He's the king in his own way while playing basketball
Yeah it's just facts that's all but he ain't on alcohol
I'm a mad dog as sharp as black brawling rap god
You'll wish your last thoughts plan on getting trapped before blast off
Was a bootleg before I even got up and held the mic
Ahead of time I was the successor and the best to rhyme
Credit goes to the fellows who propelled and identified
Testified in every direction left to right
A big essay always felt perpetual wretchedness
A blessing is needed for me to reenact a resurrection
Clever words spread in dirt said by you ain't devil's work
When it hurts I'll come back attack even in my second birth

[Verse 4]
See he's an egghead to some referring to character Humpty
Fairy tales don't always have a merciful ending
He could do whatever he wants it's a free country
So stop sending letters and songs of personal envy
Please stop all this you calling me crazy
Bitch it's me Pac Nas Big Eminem and Jay Z
Yeah I know this was a song written by Jigga and Shady
But at least I turned this into something you little babies
Now will you diss Royban again I don't want to hear maybe
Now open up your flakey eyes it is for your own safety
I ain't plaguey won't give you rabies unless you do this daily
Now pray or else I'll make you dress motherfucking ladies he's a
Motherfucking gangster freelancer prankster
The new Answer motherfuckers now have cancer what did
Ban do he's just a man from Canada amassing
Fans off you bandwagons cause he's a gangbanging

[Hook x4]
Hand grenade never been afraid to diss Gabe on his
Song and always throwing bombs all day he's just a
Hand grenade never been afraid to slaughter men
On his way on his way on his way on his way

Hand grenade never been afraid to diss Gabe on his
Song and always throwing bombs all day he's just a
Hand grenade never been afraid to slaughter men
On his way on his way on his way on his way

Hand grenade never been afraid to diss Gabe on his
Song and always throwing bombs all day he's just a
Hand grenade never been afraid to slaughter men
On his way on his way on his way on his way

Hand grenade never been afraid to diss Gabe on his
Song and always throwing bombs all day he's just a
Hand grenade never been afraid to slaughter men
On his way on his way on his way on his way



[Obie Trice]
Babe uh, yeah!
Girl, you my only one though aight, haha
You my baby, fuck all that shit, alright?
You're the one for me
Check it out

[Verse 1 - Obie Trice]
Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

[Hook - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
You gon' ride for me (you gon' ride?)
Then I'm gon' ride for you (I'm gon' ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]
We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm saying
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
'Cause I'm namin' him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo-doo, you my boo-boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
My bitch with the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggas muffin
You're fucking wit her husband

[Hook]
You gon' ride for me (you gon' ride?)
Then I'm gon' ride for you (I'm gon' ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

[Verse 3 - Obie Trice]
Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanut butter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop us? Nobody! We's that deal

[Hook]
You gon' ride for me (you gon' ride?)
Then I'm gon' ride for you (I'm gon' ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)

Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

[Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
If you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me)
Then I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you)
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you (hands down)
But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you)
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

[Outro - Obie Trice]
Yeah.. Obie Trice
Shady!



[Intro]
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up

[Hook: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]
Hands up! Shorty, when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
(I say hands up!) I'm good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
(I say hands up!) You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
(I say hands up!) Everything ain't cool as the fame
And this shit ain't as sweet as it looks (I say hands up!)
You know I'm puttin' something on me
Right before I leave outta the car (We came to party)
You go tough talkin' at me
You gon' leave out the club wit a scar (We came to party)
We pop bottles like it's all free
'Fore I leave, I'mma buy out the bar (We came to party)
You gon' order whatchu want, it's on me
I'm a G, take a look at a star (We came to party)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It feels so good to live sucka free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl's suckin' me
It mean the world to her, it's nuttin' but a nut to me
Look miss, get a grip or let a mothafucker be
I'm a rap star, who 'posed to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front, in the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride, you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya, huh
I'm a bastard, damn near chauvinist, hand over the plastic
Cause they wanna see ya man go in the casket
Rule number one: keep ya gun or get ya ass hit
And that's it, lights off and ya body stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yea
I cruise through the strip, 22's on the whip, new Ruger on the hip
Thousand dollar outfit, never stooge never slip
Follow rules or get whipped, nigga move or get hit
I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now, the jewels got 'em sick
Now it's 2006, I need a new bottom miss
It's a'ight, they can talk, I'm amused by the pricks
I'm the news out the bricks, nigga, who's hot as this?
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler, I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice-grill, but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces, they just see the chains like
OOH when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This regular shit, the everyday mentality
They charged up, don't make me put in the battery

[Hook]

Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up



[Intro]
Ha ha ha haaaa!
Yeah, what the fuck
Outsidaz, we be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
Yeah, baby
Hard act to follow
Ha, yeah
So come on and come on
So come on and come on
So come on…

[Verse 1: Yah Yah]
Yah Yah
And I’ve been black balled and outlawed like 2Pac's posse
Still no cops, the neighborhood watch could stop me
I’m like Selassie driven in a Dodge Jeep
The God’s peace while i civilise Rah's beef
Unbelievers fall in 2000 leavers
Landing more needles than the route of all evil
Dom perignon, henny
Outsidaz, cause we all scary
Shells Buried from in hell’s very
Skunk glary, my 51 Chevy, gun's near me
Squatting on the wheelie with them truck jewelery
Come on

[Verse 2: Young Zee]
You got a big mouth, when you rap
I whip my dick out
And mouth-slap you and make you kiss my out tattoo
And leave you with wet stains until you bleed red rain
And for the next days you’ll need fucking X-rays for your chest pains
The Outz splurging for drinks, so I bought a round
Fuck the quarter pound, bitch, we lock this corner down
In a fact, you’ll be robing in a black pea coat
I’ll eat gold and flip the remote while you main bitch do me a deep throat
And word is raw since we all can’t get along til I’m dead and gone
Y'all gon' all get shitted on
Come on now

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!

[Verse 3: Azz-Iz]
Azz-Iz high as space high
You blonders state side, take sides
And get ate like steak fries
Unwise guys stuffed with televised lies
Till headaches buy size
Blood sung: sci fi
Off the wet pep, I need dregs and take lives
The raw rasta, bang harder and breaks the boxer
Flow's aqua, spada, lada void cutta
Burn ‘em, rip the infrared gutta
And the horror the terror for ya pappa sick and bye bye
Send a chopper, die before ya reach the doctor
C’mon!

[Verse 4: Slang Ton]
It's tha iza mashtons
I ya wanna hit your ass kicked, just hit the av and pick ya stash with sixty bags and
Get this fucking filling craft and get the matches
I smoke more than 50 chimney hatches
I'm never quick to passin'
I smoke and choke off Simon split this pattern
Rip-o-matic, tris-o-matic
Shit, I've had it, get the average nigga blasted
In a half a second, Slang the Fattest on a record
And check it, I ain't half this racket till that ass get naked
Settle for cash and slap, kid, pass the necklace

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Product of espionage
Piss drunk on pepsi and Scotch
Sticking my fucking foot up a lesbian's crotch while pedestrians watch
Gangsters bow down to a mightier villian
There might be a million outsidaz
Hiding on the side of your building
Say goodbye to your children
Notify your next to kin
Bring some extra men
If anyone on your team expects to win
The effects of gin made me a smart ass with a bossy mouth
Six bouncers had to come and toss me out some coffee house
It ain't a riddle
After you flat line in the hospital
While I'm in the middle row at your funeral wake
Fucking your widow
Someone call the nurse and tell her to strap me down I need a harness
I bleed bizarreness
Spitting blood like Kiss'es lead guitarist

[Verse 6: Rah Digga]
Now who be yappin‘ ‘bout they shit the bomb
With them stife-ass tricks you tryna sell nickles for dimes
Boys, I’m that bitch
Chump change be 6 digits
Doing remixes for all them R and B bitches
Ya motherfuckin‘ rosters
Be filled with imposters
Digga not fresh like Lil Kim singin‘ gospel
‘Cause we be the tightest in this whole rap race
You get your contract cancelled like Homeboys In Outer Space
Come on

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!



[Intro]
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh yeah
Check it out

[Verse]
Well here I am and I came to say
It's a devastating rhyme and it goes this way
Everybody knows that I ain't no sucker
Cause I am one hard motherfucker
Cause I'm the baddest, and that is my status
And right now, yo, I'm 'bout to show you what phat is
Phat is getting off my damn job
Because I'm phat like a hamhock
And yo-yo with the damn clock
Cause I'm the fuckin' man that you love to hear
When I'm bustin' out a rhyme in your atmosphere
But right now I'm 'bout to grab my nuts
Fuck around and say shit all night just to strut
So here I go like Robert Dinero
You know that I ain't nobodies hero
Cause I'm the man, so motherfuckin' hard
Sendin' motherfuckers to the goddamn graveyard
Oooh, I know you like the that I
Have the ability on the track to punch you in the eye
Blam, bloaw, boom, slash
You know that I just smash, trash
Your whole damn crew, your whole damn life
Then I'll fuck your goddamn motherfuckin' wife
I'll take her in the backroom, I'll take her in the bathroom
And that bitch can suck on my nuts like a vacuum
Ooh, I'm hard



Yeah! (one)
As we proceed to give you what you need
(One, two...)
It's all fucked up now
What the fuck y’all gonna do now?

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It’s a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

Sometimes I feel like it’s so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I’m at a loss for words, 'cause y’all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin’ writers block
'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)

I put a kick in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, technicolor type A
On highways, bright with road rage
Pages of wind in cages of tin that bounce all around
(Surround sound) Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, overall the same thing
Sing-song karaoke copy bullsh**
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with a pencil pistol official
Sixteen-line, the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' rah blah blah blah, you can say you some-

Sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block
'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)

My mind state, raise the crime rate
Break a whole brick down for old times sake
Push an avalanche, the alpine shake
The coupes, vanilla beam
Deceased as pound cake
In my condo bitches with tatties on
Walls full of mirrors, heaven for it at it long
My life the fast lane, getting my Andretti on
Blow it all, you can't take it when you dead and gone
You can't hide it, I smell the fear
I can't either, you smell a millionaire
All crack money, now rap money
Poor platinum niggas, fuckin' rap dummies
I rap mummies, that's kilograms
My brother's keeper like Nino's man
That's G money, ghetto D money
1996, Master P money, gone

Sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block
'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)



[Intro: Eminem & Proof Singing]
You can hate me now
But I won't stop now
But I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
(Proof: Don't hate us)
Bop me and degrade me now
I'm blowing up now
(Proof: He's blowing up)
I'm so drunk now I'm throwin' up now
(Proof: Throwin' up now)
You can hate me now
(Proof: You can hate us now)
You can deflate me now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film but with a lot funnier plot
And people will feel me cause I'ma still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
Everybody's pissing me off
Even the 'No Limit' tank looks like a middle finger sideways
Flipping me off
No "duh" I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you
Then jump in the grave then bury myself

[Interlude]

Eminem: You can hate me now
Proof: Hate us!  Ha! Ha! Ya!

[Verse 2: Proof]
Need to run for cover
Eminem is white but he's still my brother
Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack
But you and Charli Baltimore got something in common
You both wack, how you feel about that?
No need to jock 'em
You so wack you make Master P sound like Rakim
When it's time to bust y'all when we trust y'all
We dust y'all, who y'all I break your balls like cue balls
I know who you are, you RuPaul, do stall
For those that try to fall and try to brawl
All y'all get bust up and banged up, framed up
How many MC bring my name up, the same slut
Said the same thing as freestyle, don't need to rehearse
My verse is universal, curse a flow
Crush you like Hershel Walker, Allie Sparker
Three day sparker highland Parker chalker
You MCs can't get darker than the Midwest bracket
It's us, me and Emzee, come right there, we feeling flimsy
Tipsed up, one time lifetime we ripped up
It's bad to the evil , met that, now it's all to say
Death rap, fuck hoes, don't even say get blast away, passed away
Blasted ass, hey yo, they say we're Aftermath
Slim Shady, you heard that, my words black
But bust you up because you preferred that
To hear me now, preferred that, the surgical snipe
Preserved you with life, I'll make you allergic to life
You die for this, don't even battle us
See us. At the. With that. Subterreanean
We knock your brain in

[End rap, commence Eminem, Proof and Tim Westwood goofing with each other and the Tim Westwood explosion sounds]



It's like this and like that and like this
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mind state
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge
And if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now



[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life



[Verse 1]
You used to be so cool, what the fuck happened to you?
Look at what all this rapping and money-stacking will do
I could've been stuck out in 'Bama, had I not flew the coop
And my babies would suffer Christmas cause Santa ain't got no loot
Uh, 'money ain't the issue' you said, that's funny now
Cause money's all I could give you to shut your motherfucking mouth
Here, take 20 grand and buy yourself a lawyer
Shit, here's a whip so my kids ain't gotta walk to the store for ya, fuck
Momma told me I should keep it real
My record ain't selling, momma, I'm trying hard enough to keep a deal
Meanwhile I'm throwing paper down into an empty pit
I got a business I'm trying to run, man, fuck this bitch
I should've seen it coming, she never pulled her weight
I'm carrying her like an elephant on a dinner plate
You gassed em, Yelawolf, you better pump your fucking brakes, asshole
You got the nerve to

[Hook 1]
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

[Verse 2]
You got some nerve to be mad at me for, fuck, anything
What have I done besides give you what I could not afford?
The kids are happy cause they really don't know anything
If they only knew what toys that their momma could afford
The vacation they could be taking when daddy's on tour
Wait, you are on vacation, that's what this shit is for
I get it, I'm like the fountain of youth
You're in the bed with your boo and you two are sipping courvoisier, true?
This song ain't no diss, it's a living proof
Skit of skin and tooth, the witch in you bit, left me with cracked roofs
I ain't done, bitch, put this shit in loop
Here's a melody so it sticks in your head like your tracks do, ooh

[Post-Verse]
You wanna walk around like it's all good
Cause I'm the golden ticket to get out of the hood
You better hope somebody cares more than I do
Cause my will don't include you

[Hook 1]
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

[Hook 2]
There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

Hold up, wait a minute, let me drop this shit up in it

[Bridge]
There'll always be a special place
For you in my bank account
You fucking bitch

[Hook 1]
Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

[Hook 2]
There ain't no fucking way I'mma let you take this hard-earned money, bitch
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down



[Intro]
Stay, RUN
We can help you, WE WON'T HELP YOU
We want you to live, WE WANT YOU TO DIE
We're your friend, WE'RE YOUR ENEMY
We won't leave you, WE WILL DESTROY YOU
We can be trusted, WE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
We'll never let you down, WE'LL LET YOU DOWN
WE'RE ALWAYS HERE!

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it (answer it)
Answer it, (answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it, (answer it)
Answer it (Answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)

[Verse 1: Truth]
It's like I have an angel and devil on each shoulder
The pills I stopped taking didn't help, It's never over
Always cackling and chattering, why is it to me It's happening?!
Try travelling but I end up back with them, I'm not with the average men
No way to escape the voices exploiting my brain
Insane til I rage at a point of joining in their game
Following my leaders til I stop hearing them
Probably a reason but not one here with them
Sweat trickles down my neck when I detect their presence
I'd best listen or instead be left for dead, in essence
That's the only true way that I'd be fully left alone
No one would listen if I shouted it out with a megaphone
So whilst I complain and feel trapped with what they've done to me
They're actually the only thing around that keeps me company
Finally then I am released into freedom
But for a short time til again they're speaking
(and I hear them)

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it (answer it)
Answer it, (answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it, (answer it)
Answer it (Answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)

[Verse 2: Truth]
I turn my head to see writing on the wall
How did it get there, I'm frightened to the core
Telling me, I'd better be, ready for the enemy
Yelling speech, that puts a spell on me, I'm terribly
Ashamed to admit there's a problem to be dealt with
The pain has no limits, I've lost it, have you felt it?
Your soul being touched and tainted, suppose it mustn't be painless
Corrodes your trust in faces, told to look another way which
Ruins your views on everything that used to be true
Approve those who are for you, only to be removed
The resident evil within turns you into a zombie
Just wandering aimlessly with my sanity taken from me
In my mind there's voices filled with hatred
There's a shadow with nothing around to make it
I can run away at the fastest of speeds
But I can't escape all these things cos they're ME
(and still I hear them)

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it (answer it)
Answer it, (answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it, (answer it)
Answer it (Answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)



[Intro: John C. Reilly]
Wanna take it from the top?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: "I gotta meet her" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
"Letter" come to me—"mail." "Sweater", "heat," "some degree."  Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said—

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your
Body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too—look at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg & John C. Reilly]
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Outro: Eminem & Mark Wahlberg]
On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!



[Intro: Announcer from Soul Calibur]
Welcome back to the stage of history

(Yo, Slim Shady!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, I'll fuckin', I'll... I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to, The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you, I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst because I never go to church?
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc leave the E.R
Then hit a bar for a liquor shot; fuck the liver spot!
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night
Do I still have to hold my tre very tight?
You feel me, God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle 9 at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me, but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Interlude: Announcer]
Maxi was seriously wounded
But the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill, like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare, ‘cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Outro: Announcer]
Time's up! You lose!

Gotham!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters
Your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now I know you're feeling discouraged
But, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose



[Intro]
Hello
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you, yeah

[Verse 1]
You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling you can't match it
I rat-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lap dances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating, baby?
My little friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin'
And your booty's shakin' like jello
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello, yeah

[Verse 2]
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man, people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked, and uh, did we, um?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's, I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Verse 3]
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Outro]
And so I'm saying, hello
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you
Yeah, it's like starting over
Clean slate, hah

Now I got you sittin back with a smirk;
Listenin with your arms crossed
Questionin Dre's credibility (What?)
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits;
Y'all be killin me

And six cars that are paid fo' - suck my dick! (Hello)
We came a long way from not givin a fuck
Sellin tapes out of a trunk to movin this far up

Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker I'm Dre - I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album bitch I don't gotta do shit

Hello and Good Morning

Girl I’m so cheap I can turn your Happy Meal sad

Breakfast burritos, Fritos, Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos
That’ll be the only thing I feed hoes!
So baby anything with a dollar menu I treat you
My back hand is lethal so I keep you at arms length
So I can always reach you
Get a knee to the gut, thats the only way I say I need you
Lady I’m just trying to get a rim job off the deal
And I ain't talkin’ Giovanni’s on the wheels
So let me see you mommies get ya tail feathers kicking
I’m here to cock block like a square male chicken, come on

My mama couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin
I was often involved with niggas breakin the law
I look back, 'Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw

Threw the sack to his lil' niggas workin the set
And if you got it you gettin wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit

I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus 2: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to see in double

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget so
Fuck what they say
Let's run the floor
Until it breaks

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus 2: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to see in double

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yep, yep
Nothing high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
I'm prob-ably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or Ciroc
I'm not Puffy, but I'mma run the city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a fricking idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight
Big city lights, little indignity
Hot diggity, this Biggie is getting me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you, I'll knock your dick in the dirt
Bickering worse than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel, hanging from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building 'cause we're tearing it down
Security, get out the fricking way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron it’s loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going AHH AHH
'Cause

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
(Oh oh)

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)



[Hook 1]
I've got the mind of Einstein
Your favorite rapper loves me, he said it on "Fine Line"
Ask Royce da 5'9", Spunk, or Bizarre
We used to smoke while Kim was cuffed in the trunk of the car
We used to write, rap, crack jokes, and perform
Backstage at our shows be like a scene from a porn
We'd party every night, be hungover in the morn'
It seems like a dream, man, what were we on?

[Verse 1]
I was so intrigued when I heard Shady mention my name
I felt relieved cause for a while I was thinking like
Wow my pal bounced in the bottom of the ninth like when every out counts
And it made me kind of mad to the point I started dissin' him
I don't know if you've been listening
The dissin' was a cry for help, cause I was missin' him
Imagine if your best friend was fuckin' missin'
And you know he's still alive, but you can't get in touch
And he's not reachin' out to you so now y'all ain't gettin' up
And in your head you're like really? am I tripping? what the fuck?
Then you see on TV, your friend is worth a million bucks
So that's why I did it, let's leave it in the past
Tie it in a bag and put it out with the trash
And let me take this time to put my pride to the side
And honor him correctly while we're both still alive
See I know why his fans come out and form lines
When it comes to emceeing, he's the greatest of all time
Yeah I said it, dude is iller than Biggie and Pun
He done sold more records than Diddy and Run
Then he took a fuckin' chance, signed 50, and won
So I just wanna say I think he's nifty as fuck
Susie and my fellow stans, are you with me, or what?
I'mma tell you all about it, just give me a buck
Bitch

[Hook 2]
I've got the mind of Einstein
Your favorite rapper loves me, he said it on "Fine Line"
Ask Royce da 5'9", Spunk, or Bizarre
We used to smoke while Kim was cuffed in the trunk of the car
We used to write, rap, crack jokes, and perform
Backstage at our shows be like a scene from a porn
Every song that we did, lines was gettin' quoted
Like this next verse, Eminem wrote it

[Verse 2]
Scrub bucket, step in the club rugged
Grab a jug, chug it, and talk some ol' bugged drug shit
Thinkin' you tough nugget, you see this slug? hug it
Harm anybody's bones for thinkin' they thug ruggish
Walk around the streets sluggish, fucked up, but fuck it
I'm fuckin' the world like I love public
This style is hard to swallow so you upchuck it
Get obstructed, handcuffed, kidnapped, and abducted

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
I remember gettin' high and ridin' over a bridge
Pullin' up in San Francisco and fighting some kids
And it was cool cause it was our first scuffle as a unit
We don't back down from a beef, we step to it
We don't give way to a storm, we get through it
We even took our motto from Nike, "Just Do It"
We made an oath, cracked a bottle, made a toast
The oath should be honored cause I feel I'm kind of dope
So uh, keep it real, my brother
Hook your mans up with a deal my brother
Child support's killing me, my license suspended
I can't even get behind the wheel my brother
Sometimes I feel my brother
I let the music industry steal my brother
So I'm out for vengeance, screamin' and blastin'
And I'mma start a new group and name it after him
I'm startin' up the Shady Corps
Spittin' that real hip-hop like this was Eighty-Four
That Role Model nigga, that rah-rah, that crazy raw
Music people payin' more attention than they pay to y'all
So I'mma be fine, just like these ho's that I'm meetin' online
Just like these ho's that I meet at the mall
If you see Eminem, tell him give me a call, yo

[Hook 1]



[Produced by DJ Rad, Eminem & Sha Money XL]

[Intro]
Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up, niggas holla "Roll up!"
And I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money, you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em Girls
Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Bridge]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high, be high
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high, be high
But I twist that lye, lye lye lye

[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit!"
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me, who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them .380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga? Go ahead, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so, ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Outro]
G-Unit, are you ready? G-Unit, are you ready?
G-Unit, are you ready?
Nigga, ready or not, here I come, come, come



[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah... Huh... (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop)
Turn my mic up a little bit (hip hop)
Hit some of this Cali guido (hip hop)
Listen to some motherfucking... (hip hop)
Everybody got a little story they gotta tell
Niggas ain't heard my shit...hahaha
The life of Bizarre...what!

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Hip hop, that's the way of life (Word?)
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic (Grab it!)
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab a pen and pad and start to jot some
Always told myself that I would never be losing
Man, I ain't had no hood, my mother was always moving (Damn!)
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit (C'mon!)
Goddamn, Mama, what's the point? (the fuck?)
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags (Aughh!)
Jump in the truck with my step-dad
When I was ten years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, man, the force got stronger (Yeah!)
And me and my rap partner wasn't seeing eye to eye
So he picked up and started a group with some other guys (Haha)
This is hip hop, man, I won't stop
Yo Big Boi (What up?) Gimme a beatbox
*beatbox*

[Hook]
Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
From the Hip Hop Shop to Maurice Malone (Uh-huh)
Ten years later, I'm still in the zone (Word?)
7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born (Yeah!)
United we stand, divided we swore (D12!)
And hell yeah, I lived in my car (Yeah!)
Bitch, I was homeless, I would have slept in a jar (Hahahaha)
And Dirty Management, I wish all the best
But me and my niggas, we had to do what's best (That's right)
It was a mess, all them taxes and accounts (What?)
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't buy an ounce (Hell yeah)
And now that we platinum, they diss our name (What?)
Like we won't go to the car and get them thangs
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
From the fight with Whitey Ford to the beef with Royce (What!)
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and niggas in the club
To the e-dubs and niggas you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun (Naw)
But I'll learn quick if the fucking beef come!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishing in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, did, I
Can't see no country singers beefing over some guitar
Riff that Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shooting range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just trying to let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughing cause I couldn't aim
So I'd pull the fucking target closer and just shoot the thang
I used to have this theory: keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no CCW license
I tried to apply for one, they said it'd take 5-6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come?
Hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk
Now, back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple platinum, I ain't trying to catch no murder one
Figured I'd shoot to wound, probably miss with at least one
But them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up
Then I'mma say it's self defense," how come I had the gun?"
"Was because I was at the range, on my way back from"
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'd get a year for each bullet at the most
As opposed to having a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded once I got it
Thank God it was empty the night that I got caught with it
What the fuck, man I thought that it was supposed to be

[Hook]



[Lucie]
Come on everybody get on up
Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Elijay is in the spot tonight
As I'mma make it feel alright (Make it feel alright)
Come on baby just party with me
Let loose and set your body free
Leave your situations at the door
So when you step inside jump on the floor

[Elisa]
Music's the odyssey
It's here for you, for me
Just listen find the magic key
Mmh
It's only gonna be about a matter of time
Before you get loose and start loose your mind
Cop you a drink, go head and rock your ice
Cause we celebrating No More Drama in our life

[L.E.J]
Let's get it started, ha! let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha! let's get it started in here

Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Lucie]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot, rap-bot

[Elisa]
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

[Lucie]
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman

[Elisa]
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and

[Lucie ; Elisa]
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

[Lucie]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot, rap-bot

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your pictures on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (not so bad)



Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker!

{*beat changes to 2Pac's "Hit 'Em Up"*}

Kill Whitey! - Hahaha
Kill Whitey! - Detroit! What? What?
Kill Whitey! - .. yo, yo
Kill Whitey! - Haha! Look

First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath
Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's
Who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know!

[Hook: Eminem]
Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up!

Hahaha, yo check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'mma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots!

[Kon Artis]
Yo! Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'mma beat your ass while they watch

[Kuniva]
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? There's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge

[Hook]

[Eminem]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed
With his chest open
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
Cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
While my sales makin records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up!

[Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

[Swifty]
What the fuck?! Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
And stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
Cause we "Hit 'Em Up" like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur

[Eminem]
You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

{*laughing*}
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off
{*needle drags, beat stops*}

Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kickin a man while he's down
God damn! I quit
Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin punk
Aiyyo..

Proof died, what happened? (What happened?)
Marshall stopped rapping (Damn!)
I guess that makes me the captain (Uh-huh)
Hit the matress (Okay)
Pistol-packing (Uh-huh), sick assassin (Yeah)
Hit the gas and (Okay), get to mashing
D12 broke up? Who you bitches asking?
Our clique's relaxing in the hills of Aspen
Popping pills and Aspirin
And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life
Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
So I figured that I would grab the mic
Like a nigga bout to rhyme right after Christ
Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight
Grab an o and I have to light
That's only right, living like a rock star is the only life!
And we are, six grown men, who are old friends
To my nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton
All the way down, I'mma hold them
D12 nigga, till the world end (D12!)

Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 2: Swifty]
A lot of niggas try to underestimate me
Till I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea
Yall been placed on a contract for hating
I'mma waste them, one by one, for tainting
My ability to kill a facility, I'mma send them to Satan
Fast as a child rapist facing
Life or trifle, Henny has made me in waiting
They gon' lock me up under the basement
I'm a one man army, marine and navy
You done made me angry, I'm crazy, insane
And maybe I bite the face off your baby
For anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie
I'mma break their Halo
Put them on the reaper's payroll
Erase them and hang their soul
It ain't no hoes here, McVay got a scroll
With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!

Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I know you thought we were done, we rose up
Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up
They hit us with the best shot and we're still standing
So tell the world it can lick our scrotum
Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt?
Who wanna be the fall guy? Who want the pump?
Who wanna get slumped just for looking at me sideways
Every time I roll up I'mma keep it blunt
Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall?
Y'all did it big like Costco
And we back in this bitch like a tampon
Still talk dirty, Em's clean like a bar of soap
And you will soon slip, on some buffoon shit
My hand's on a sweeper, yours on a broomstick
So stop looking all stupid, I'm rude and abusive
And strapped, don't make me use it

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!

Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Aight, here's where I come in at
I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin
So you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
Step right in this mark with my henchmen and
Walk, straight to the stage
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
Fall back, little cocksucker
I ain't A&W, don't get your cold mugs in my way
Get 'em? Shattered, fucking A
Been this way since B.C., what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
Don't get turned to a vegetable dick face
You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D12 spitting flames like flamethrowers
Spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors
That cut with the same force as chainsaws
Hope you're coming with your A game
Cause things have changed in this game
Isn't the same game, boys
The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!




[Intro] x2
La télé nous rend fou, la raison c’est pas rentable
Tu peux même baiser ta soeur avec l’accord parental
Mais c’est gore là j’arrête, c’est épouvantable
Mon avenir s’effrite tellement quand ce moment j'passe des jours en sable
Ouais des, ouais des, ouais des jours en sable
Je crois que je suis aussi vif qu’un épouvantail
Si tu guettes mes cheveux, j'crois t’en vois la paille
Crédibilité en perte quand ta foi bataille
Les nouveaux rappeurs ne disent plus rien, sauf "Envoie la maille !"

Sauf, sauf "Envoie la maille !"

[Couplet unique]
Ici c’est V.A.L
Un deux trois , t'sais pas quoi, V.A.L.D décape (quoi ?)
Les quatre coins du monde
Si t’as capté casse toi
However si si t'as la classe toi
Tu peux manger ma prostate, ma foi je veux bien mais enfin quel âge t’as ?
J'pense qu’à m’enfuir de la fac pour poser du rap sale
Tellement de MC au chômage, la vie c’est pas rap star
La pauvreté n’est qu’un stade de ma ie-v , j'suis instable de famille, garde ton swag de mamie
Basta, si tu veux taffer faut que tu rases ta be-bar
Pour être Français faut trembler quand les rastas débarquent
Nan, je suis pour les préjugés quand tu casses la démarche
Sinon je dis respect, viens pas me casser les noix
Mister érotique sur ton steh c’est légal
Mon flow casse des bouches, envoie le mic que j'éclate
Tous ces cons qui disent la même, seraient-ils télépathes ?
Va pas croire que tu changes le monde, tu constates les dégâts
Et quand certains font dans la négritude j'fais la maigritude  naturel et blanc comme apéricube
Je péra les doutes dans l'incertitude
Terminus, j'suis venu schlasser la pellicule
Ceci veut rien dire, s'en est ridicule, tous les gens s'insultent même les minuscules
Oh tiens je trouve du sexe dans les pédicures
1,2,3 je suis démagogue, ouais la vie c'est dur
Ca met des gifles à tes pensées, mon rap c'est Soul Calibur
Tous ces braves ne se marraient plus avant d'être sur qu'elle est pur qu'elle est sûre, un monticule de moisissures
Ok c'est gore mais y'a de l'amour si tu t'mets zeb sur Malibu
Dans la spirale aspiré  frelon j'aspire à l'hystérie
Ouais, deux spirit aspirine autour de moi les tasses péri, les patéticiennes périssent, j'kiffe à mes risques et périls
Y'a pas de mérite, atterris, tu peux casse-dédi à tes rimes
Ça va vite, déjà deux 16 dans tes yeux
Double sens les gle-rais plongés dans le sang messieurs
Mesdames je parle bien
Je vends du rêve bleu, c'est fashion un poto gay et mécheux
Mon coeur, c'est Minas Tirith
Je veux bien qu'on menace qui risque le temps que les keums saisissent que déjà les keufs saisissent
Je veux pas de ta vie qu'une foutue pétasse dirige
Mon coeur c'est Minas Tirith
Je veux bien qu'on menace qui risque
Fais pas le beau gosse si tu pètes comme un enculé
Tous les samedis soirs riment avec veau-cer enfumé
La lère-ga a accentué le zeb qu'à accentuer les nerfs
Une chicha-cerise le reste est à censurer

[Outro]
La concurrence sont mes subalternes hein
T'as beau être plus bas que terre, viens pas me parler si t'as le cul plein de sperme !
L.O.R hein !
Double F, Suik on blaze AD
R.E.M, K.R.Y.S si si, tu connais bien sûr
Emile Zola District hein
Aulnay-sous, zone pavillonnaire hein !



[Intro: Smokey Legendary, Logic & Both]
Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahahahaha
(Roof!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies

[Verse 1: Logic]
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Logic]
There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said "Rover" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

[Outro: Chris D'Elia]
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin
Dammit, a can of pada-



[Skit]
Woman #1: I know that ain't my homie over there

[Verse 1]
My hoodrat's fatal, they not stable
I could be at a dinner table
With 'Union, Gabrielle', fine as hell, pierce in the naval
Look at my rat like she act brand new
"Hey boo, how are you?"
Yeah, cool, now tally-o your ass back across the room
You see me with Pocahontas
I ain't tryin to be honorary but honestly I ain't tryin be bothered
You got a brain, define honors in college
You'd rather define how your knowledge in chronic
I'm tryin step my game up a notch, bitch
Your aim to cock block on my plot, bitch
She hot and you're not, so stop bitch
Quit blowin up my motherfuckin spot, shit

[Hook]
How could you be here? Why don't you leave here
I ain't tryin to see you everytime at my show
I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there
You know how we get down on the low
You're playin me cheap here
Tonight I don't drink beer
I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go
You's the freak here, you don't know me here
She's a model, you my late night ho

[Verse 2]
They chase me (Obie, Obie), when they see me in the club
With a lot alike Stacey Dash, they gettin mad
Then, they wanna brag and say "already had 'em"
He ain't shit cause he rap for Mr. Mathers (girl)
Plus 50 Cent's like ten times badder (girl)
D12 shouldn't of had him on they album" (girl)
That's what I get just for stabbin them hoes
They nag, when I pose with a chick with nice toes
Ya'll knew 'O' before for new hoes, but since it's a new ho
Just act like you never knew 'O', boo
We still crew, we just the same (uh huh)
Just not tonight, you don't know my name (you don't know me)

[Hook]
How could you be here? Why don't you leave here
I ain't tryin to see you everytime at my show
I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there
You know how we get down on the low
You're playin me cheap here
Tonight I don't drink beer
I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go
You's the freak here, you don't know me here
She's a model, you my late night ho

[Verse 3]
Hey yo fellas, never get timid when the chicken is interferin
When your chillin with a chick, who a ten (damn)
Let her know the situation at hand (uh huh)
And tell the bitch go play with her friends (BITCH)
This is for the model that your chillin with, hoodrats is often awful
My advice keep your mouth on muffle
Feistiness give 'em the right to snuff you, and you too pretty to scuffle
This is for the rats, go on with that (go on)
Quit actin like you smokin that crack
Cause he pokin that chick, you ain't ownin on shit
Ain't no rings on that finger
And every nigga in the hood ain't triple teamed her

[Hook]

[Obie Trice - talking]
That's right, ha, you see me at the club
With a, with a look-alike Halle motherfucker
Look alike, look a, look alike Alicia Keys
Haha, you don't know me
Don't say shit, you know who I'm talking to
All my hoodrat bitches
Neneh, Aqua and Trip Entanetta
Haha, all ya'll
I'm straight, Obie Trice

[Intro: Eminem]
So I changed, huh? You got a phone
Pick it up, call me

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We were so young so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Don't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you

[Verse 3: Proof & Eminem]
It gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends
Forever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you



[Eminem - Talking]
So I changed huh, you got a phone
Pick up and call me

[Hook - Eminem]
How Come.. we don't even talk no more and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way no how. This bullshit can't be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!

[Verse 1 - Eminem]

[Eminem]
How come?

[Verse 4 - Bizarre]
When we started dating I was almost 9
Now I'm 35 missing that big behind
And all I do is drive think about our lives
Come home every night dodging butcher knives
And I ain't gon' lie I like the attention
Sleeping with other wives saying I'm out fishing
Let's put it all behind let's settle our difference
You ready to talk I'm ready to listen

[Verse 5 - Swifty McVay]
Back in the days I was feening for fame
It's a shame rappers just like coochie you kick game until you bang
And every waking morning I'm doing the same thing
Just hanging and brainstorming just trying to make a name
When you blessing the game
That's when everyone around you whole persception will change
And you accept it cuz you made it
But when your funds faded your treated like a scoundrel
Obviously your homies never gave a shit about you
I pain my dues twice and I ain't lying
See that's first in the hood and the other after I signed
No time for being kind when your enemies shown
I walk alone while y'all trying anything to get on

[Hook - Eminem]



"Turn my vocals up a little bit more Scott... all of 'em..."
"Yeah... uh huh..."

[Verse 1: Hush]
I'm caught up inside a tornado and sucked in
By a rainstorm holding a hairdryer that's plugged in
Somewhere between the Renaissance Center and 8 Mile
Inside the Rock City that has spawned a unique child
And lightening strikes twice I was hit when they birthed me
And now I gotta live with this mouth that they cursed me
They said I gotta use it with tracks and try to fuse it
Don't abuse it and don't ever let 'em crack on your music
So I sit and watch the people that do it and don't pursue it
And instead I jot a little bit down then go review it
I just wait until I'm ready to leap and jump into it
Until I feel a little more confident I can do it
Not so many years later I've waited and now I'm here
To release a masterpiece on everybody in fear
I ain't holding nothing back in a world that's full of evil
My words can only injure or hurt so many people
I'm here to trade spaces shatter and blade faces
With guitars and bass lines and embrace and break stages
The pain'll come in phases for now it's just outrageous
When I'm knocking hear me cocking my gauge cause I'm impatient

[Hook 1: Nate Dogg w/ (Hush)]
From the Motor City...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word on down)
Down to New Orleans...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
From the penitentiary...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
To the criminals roaming the streets...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming

[Verse 2: Hush]
I've waited so long to unleash on these streets
A diary with more fury in sprees than Alicia Keys
My words are mere visions of movies with non-fiction
Intertwined in each rhyme that I spit with sweet diction
The rest are so pathetic and best are copasetic
By the time it hits you dead in the chest I hope you get it
I'm out to break laws slice and break jaws
Or I'll be on your stage with an axe and chainsaws
Of course my pains raw my brain is off a little
Ever since the first time I could rhyme and solve a riddle
Simon says go ahead and block the silence
And fuck with anybody who says to stop the violence
Go run and tell your parents I'm evil and I'm the devil
When it's gonna take a nation of mil to stop a rebel
Cause now it's all over I'm crazy and even zany
Lyrically Scorsese on a track by Mr. Shady

[Hook 2: Nate Dogg w/ (Hush)]
From San Diego...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
All the way back to Queens...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
This ain't a rumor...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
Remember you heard that from me...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming

[Verse 3: Hush]
My behavior gets erratic on tracks that got static
When I spit the bullets just keep coming it's automatic
I'm ill it's been said every letter I let sink
And left 'em dead inside a puddle of songs with red ink
I played away shy since the day I stayed high
And staged dive from the top of my roof at age 5
My mother always said that her son was gonna make it
If he wasn't gonna make it he'll have to go and take it
So now I'm on Geffen the whole world is trippin'
Cause another new MC from the D is off and flippin'
And this one's Lebanese do we have to say the bomb
Is he related to Osama Bin Laden or Saddam
I'm just a suicidal bomber on tracks and always killin'
Everything that ever gets in my way and such a villian
If you think you know me now then get ready because I'm grinning'
This ain't even near the end of Omega it's just beginning'

[Hook 3: Nate Dogg w/ (Hush)]
From the City of Angels...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
To the streets of Mississippi...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
For the players that's hatin'...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
You better start clearing the street...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming

(Tell 'em Nate what) Hush Is Coming
(Pull 'em out mafuckerz cause) Hush Is Coming
(Better run cause) Hush Is Coming
(Better duck mafuckerz cause) Hush Is Coming



[Intro]
Yo check this out! In life, you got your wannabe's
You got your gonnabe's, and you got your hasbeen's
Then you got your hustlers and hardcore

[Domingo]
Oh a line with fakes a time
Fresh time, with sure more times
Jimminy two time respect mine
Big click with breakfast and blacklist
War! War! War! War!
Vision, knocking you out motherfucker listen
Superstition can help you in this battle
G's and sandles who surround you in all the angles
All over your shit in shamble
Looking the little of latter you fucking runt

[Hook 2x]
Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!
Say what, say what, we’re hustlers and hardcore
Keeping it right, keeping it rough keeping it raw

[Domingo]
Danger hander
Banging swinging banner all single hander
Hit the left propaganda
Ill manner bad grammar stander
Got the people chasing with cameras by the manner
Hit and slap us, so pajamas
Hiding in the hampers under dirty pampers
Happy brands will make them happy campers
Little laughter
Shit nappers

[Eminem]
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet, 'til it spins on a broken axis

[Hook 2x]
Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!
Say what, say what, we’re hustlers and hardcore
Keeping it right, keeping it rough keeping it raw

[Domingo]
Aw yeah {*echoes*}



[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can be calm, I can be cool
I can be rude, I can do whatever you want me to do
Whatever you want me to be, I can be it
Whatever side you want me to show you, just let me know
And I'll let you see it, I got a college degree at being
The prick if you push me, won't hesitate to stick my dick in you pussies
So however you want it, we got it, you can get it
Anywhere you like it whichever way you prefer it, cause we serving it
However you want it, Bitch

[Verse 1: helluva]
However, whoever, anytime, whenever, whatever Im coming with 9's or betta
I'll put 2 in your medulla oblongota, walk around this bitch worry free
Like hakuna matata, get grimey ain't a theme boy I'm used to the drama
I take beat to the extreme, man I'll shoot at your momma, man these faggots
Done make me lose all my patience, I got all kinds of guns for all occasions
Got rap niggas running like Walter Payton, hit em with the full matic have em
Harlem Shakin' hop on the phone and make a call to satan, let him know that you coming
So when you get there my dogs is waiting I'll rob you an thank ya, blast ya an shank ya
Even your mans will be like "NOW THAT NIGGA'S GANGSTA"
I don't give a fuck who you with or who you get cause I'm a lunatic an you a bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: helluva]
I'm king kong, I got "I ain't never scared" on my ringtone, that's my theme song
44 with the beam on, if my niggas got drama I'm that shoulder to lean on
Helluva coming thrugh with that soldier fatigue on at they door like DING DONG
Show em the beef on and once its on, there no fixing it, my killas do this shit
For fun, I can't tell em "Don't get in it" don't run up on ya whip, put a whole clip in it
I tell em I owe him one, he'll tell me "don't mention it." You scared to come out, that's alright
We goin' take shifts and shoot up your house all night. Pop four about yo bushes an unload on yo ass
Leave you layin on the street with a hole in yo ass buss a few a come back an run over yo ass
If you think a nigga loony you just don't know the half

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: helluva]
Anytime you ready, I could while out or I could be calm an deadly, I'm like oh dog an menace
Like tom an belly, I'm a cross between jason saddam and freddy. Tougher than leather, Beretta
Tuck under the leather, extended clip, make it seem like i'm bussin foreva. When an got me 3 bananas
And I stuck em together. Leave a motherfucker sick like he under the weather, niggas be like my man sweet
You can't beat him at rappin' , they be like you wrong as hell, when I see him I'll slap him
To be honest I ain't into all that battle rap shit, I got something on my hip
You could battle that bitch? it'll lift you off your feet an make you acrobatic
Tell a joke an ask a nigga what you laughin' at bitch? He ain't know he could get clapped
For that shit go to jail an tell a judge that nigga asked for that shit

[Chorus]



[Verse 1: Redman]
Word is bond, Redman makes the kids run
I'm seeing dead people creepin' on my income
Piercing the ear drums, how the fuck he do it?
Got little miniature Redmans, crawlin' into it, cause my
Back against the wall get to actin' like a fool
That's what happens to students, when you keep 'em after school
I stay a wild child, beef, bring it like "Raow! Raow!"
My guns go boom, boom, and your guns go pow pow!
Still, I feel a chill, bumps in my body
The spirits of other MC's records in the party
Cause, me being, the man that I am
I'm awfully hunted by them guns with wide lens on the scope
Sucka, you miss, I'm a get my laugh on
You fuck around and woke up, with the stash gone
How I spaz on niggas is ugly
You got the game fucked up on makin' the money
See I don't say I'm thugged out, but I know my choice
Back up plans, got back up; if I blow my voice
That's why I'm Brick City, can't wait to put my niggas on
To see us perform, we sellin' out at Ticket Tron
What I'm doing is wrong, but It lasts long
Yo, toast the niggas that passed on
Get it while the gettin good, whole life with a grip
Cause when it's gone, that's it, that's it, that's it!

[Hook 2X]
I'm seeing dead people creepin on my income
You win some, you lose some, but you never run

[Verse2: Redman]
(Yo what's on, come on)
Redman it's the war head; BOOM!
Nigga I don't die, I was born dead
Top of the mornin' to ya, I wake up like a born loser
The world is my Bermuda; Triangle and I'm lost in it
I'm hearin' voices saying "Red, the wanna put holes in ya authentic"
I walk among winners and I put out work, nigga
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Haters hate on, you can tell the rest of the class
I can see the evil in you, through a masculine task
Smoke the greenest grass I live by the hand of god
That me, ya boys, or ya guns won't leave a scar
You niggas too hard and not ready to scrap
Knowin' damn well, ya moms raised you better than that
Redman the weirdo, I'm my own dirty clique
With 35 KO's nigga I'll make it 36!

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3: Redman]
Thou shall not fuck with raw, Funk Docta
Takin' ya breath when I drop ya
I feel for you cause cats, try to test me
You a waiteress set of an MC, check please
Been waited way too long, now it's time to put Gilla on the map
Gilla on ya back, same Zombies, from Phila on attack
Niggas want it back, Triggas on the map
Won't stop me, I'm not a quitter that's a rap
If I was just broke you wouldn't notice me
Ha, Ha, but look at the bright side my man
Nobody really planned to fail, you really failed the plan
Gotta keep the bomb like an Israeli hand
My music's killa, your's girlie; Scram!
I can hang out in the same place as my fans
Let 'em touch me, feel how far that I swam
Look in my eyes, ya noddin to sleep
It ain't a watch, as Eminem, providin the beat
That's why..

[Hook 4X]

(CHatter)
Uhn!
It's Charles Hamilton
Feel free to make your comparisons now
I'm in the D..
With E...
D.E.M.E....
That's how you spell the first 4 letters of Demevolist
Think about it...

(Verse 1)
For those that thought they knew me..
Say hello to the one who you thought was the new me
Success would be thought of awesome usually
But when I talk to dudes they all confuse me
Thinking to themselves
....
"This nigga changed
Copped his chick a chain
Popped up in the game
Now this nigga's strange!"
To be honest? I'm the same
Modest in my brain
Cocky to ya lames
It's just my aura, got me playing origami
More punany
Dr. Evil when I drop the lethal
Spit lots of ether, kid
Not repeating sh1t!
And if I do it's cause you didn't get the point
So Em' twist a joint
Watch how these niggas point
The ghost of Pac, watch the Bishop anoint..
The state pen
Behind bars... Amen!

(Hook)
They keep telling me the hood don't miss me and every lil nigga in the hood wanna diss me
And I don't care, I don't care, I don't care...
These hoes used to act all prissy, diss me, now they all kissy kissy
And I don't care, I don't care, I don't care....
I got class so you can't dismiss me and all you can do is just sit and be pissy!
And I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't caarrre, I don't careeee!!!

(Verse 2)
It's wack how muhfuckas know my background
Try and rule me then I sit they ass back down!
YouTube me. I'm spitting crack, that's how
You know who flew me to rip this track. Mad now?
I'm Mad Cow, beef with me and you're sick!
Act foul, you get ignored, I ain't seeing you pricks!
Go'head, get mad. That's a reason to be pissed!
I been dreaming of this shit
Steaming on a piff
Sleeping on a bitch
Finding any excuse to be in nigga's cribs
Settle for stomach aches when I need to take a shit
Pleading with my bitch
Bleeding from my lips
Believe with every kiss..
That she would make a difference like she was different
But she was just one of them bitches
Which is reason for me leaving this instant...
Who would of thought that a tree could end us?
...
And that very same tree makes me try
The reason I'm alive is the reason I died
Cause this is heaven, I'm happy as hell!
So do like me in high school and start stabbing yaself
'CAUSE I'm ON!

(Hook)
They keep telling me the hood don't miss me and every lil nigga in the hood wanna diss me
And I don't care, I don't care, I don't care...
These hoes used to act all prissy, diss me, now they all kissy kissy

I got class so you can't dismiss me and all you can do is just sit and be pissy!
And I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't caarrre, I don't careeee!!!

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I feel pretty (x3)
And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

[Hook: Eminem]
I feel ugly (x3)
Slut don't touch me or hug me
I'm mad and I pity any girl who gets with me tonight

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin

[Verse 3: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I feel pretty (x3)
And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys



[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Check check, one two, one two, one two (Yo, it’s rollin'?)
Yeah yeah yeah, Dr. Dre up in here, y'all know what this is
It’s what you’ve been waitin' for, Funkmaster Flex
Big caps, Def Jam records givin' it to you, baby
Yo, Eminem, show these mothafuckas what time it is, baby!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be a lonely man, only mad
'Til I got a million dollars, shit, now if I only had
Some fuckin' hair I'd pull it faster than a bullet
Out of 2Pac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm tryin' to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate this straitjacket, it ain't latchin', and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwin' their fuckin' self at it
My head is achin', I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is takin' too long to bring me this se-da-dation
Anyway, I got down with Dre
The first man who taught me how a Glock sounded to spray
Runnin' up and down the street, screamin', "Fuck the police!"
When you still had your mother's fuckin' nipple stuck in your teeth
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler "Bravo!!!"
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch
And beat my kids in public – suck my dick, bitch!
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face
But I won't, 'cause you probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass 2Pac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talkin'
Walkin' like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumblin'
Mumblin' a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs when I'm fly on kites?

[Interlude: Eminem + (Dr. Dre)]
Motherfucker! Slim Shady (Dr. Dre)
I'm drunk, pass the TEC!

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin'! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin'! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fuckin' girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych! I'm just jokin', for Christ's sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me, 'cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailie Jade, Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter – fuck you, lady!
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in, you could die for nothin'
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fuckin' man raped with a Band-Aid
Over his mouth and shove his head in a fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buyin' this shit
Quit fuckin' buyin' it! I'm tired, bitch, I'm dyin' to quit
Hip-hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since three years old

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin'! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Fuck that, turn that shit off!
Let's get the fuck out of here!
You know how we do! {echo}



[Dr. Dre Intro]
Kontrol, kontrol, 1,2 , 1,2 1,2
Yea yea yeah Dre burada, ne olduğunu biliyorsunuz
Bu beklediğiniz şey Funk Master Flex, Big Kap
Def Jam Records sunar bebeğim
Yo, Eminem göster şunlara gününü bebeğim

[Eminem Verse 1]
Eskiden yalnız bir adamdım ve sinirliydim ta ki milyon dolar kazanana kadar
Eğer bir saçım olsaydı
Ambulans onu kurtarmak için geç kalmadan
2Pac’ın göğsüne saplanan mermiden daha hızlı çekerdim
Tekrardan geliştirmeye çalışıyorum, o bir kazaydı
Amsterdam’da sırtımı bir hayranıma yasladım sonrada yaralandım
Deli gömleğinden nefret ediyorum, kitlenmiyor
Elimi pantolonumun cebine zımbaladılar
Hücre sanki benden önce kullanılmış gibi
Ama beni yinede içeri tıktılar
Başım çatlıyor, kendimi ilaçlara verdim
Fakat bu ilacın beni yatıştırması çok vakit alıyor. (Hadi ama!)
Her neyse Dre’yleyim (Naber?)
Glock’un bana nasıl kullanıldığını öğreten adam
Sen hala annenin memesini emerken
Sokaklarda bir sağa bir sola ‘’Polisleri sikeyim!’’ diye koşturuyor
Colorado’dan sonra rol model oldum
Şimdi yapmaları gereken tek şey beni takip etmek ve takdir etmek
Orospumu sokak ortasında yumrukluyorum ve çocuklarımı pataklıyorum
Sikimi yala orospu
Bir adamın suratını dağıtabilecek kadar deliyim ama yapmıyorum
Çünkü büyük ihtimal onun yerinde olmak isteyeceksiniz
Fake 2pac imajınla içine bir çorap koy
Siz ibneler sıkı değilsiniz, sadece sarhoş olduktan sonra konuşkan oluyorsunuz
(Dövüşmek ister misin?) Büyük ihtimalle konuşan en tuhaf alkoliğim
Arka cebinde merdiven taşıyan bir cüce gibi yürüyorum
Beni evinin çevresinde tökezlerken yada mırıldanırken görürsen
Aynı sarhoş amcamın yaptığı gibi
Bil ki çakır keyif değilim, uçuyorum
Uçurtma gibi uçabiliyorken
Neden uyuşturucuya ihtiyaç duyayım ki?
Slim Shady, orospu çocuğu!

[Nakarat}
Dr. Dre
Acayip sarhoşum

Eğer bu akşam tutuklanırsam
Zaman bu akşam eve dönemeyebilirim
Devam et, aç kapat. Eminem burada
Kapat, aç. Dre burada

Eğer bu akşam tutuklanırsam
O zaman bu akşam eve dönemeyebilirim
Devam et, aç kapat. Eminem burada
Kapat, aç. Dre burada

[Eminem Verse 2]
Tüm dünya bir lastik gibi dönebilir ve oturabilir
Ben bir kızı saç maşasıyla ateşe veriyorum
Deli, şaka yapıyorum İsa aşkına
Sakın sinirleneyim deme
Çünkü ben sokağa çıktım ve 6 kıza tecavüz ettim
Bazı insanlar anlamıyor, ama bunun beni mutsuz etmesine izin vermiyorum
Çünkü onlar bir şey bilmiyor
Onlar bıkkın olmanın ne demek olduğunu anlamıyor
Ve sen çok sıktın, düştüğünde bir daha kalkamayacaksın
Benim aklım kendi aklına sahip, bazen onu evde bulamıyorum
Fırında saklanıyor. (Hey kimse var mı?)
Siktir et, beynin hakkında konuşmak çılgınca
Benimki hala 480 derecelik fırının içinde
Hailie Jade, baban seni seviyor bebeğim
Bana kızımı nasıl yetiştireceğimi öğretme, sikiyim seni
Siz eleştirmenler eleştirmek istiyorsunuz ama göremiyorsunuz
Bireyler bir suçlu gözüyle yaşıyor
Büyüdüğüm mahallede bir hiç uğruna ölebilirsin
Ve Dirty Dozen beni izliyor o yüzden bir şeyler yapmayı deneyin
Bir adamın ağzını yara bandıyla kapatıp tecavüz edeceğim ve
Kafasını havalandırma pervanesine sokacağım
Bana ne söyleyebileceğimi yada ne söyleyemeyeceğimi söyleme
Yada bu albümü kimin aldığını önemsiyormuşum gibi
Benden hayran kitlemin yaş aralığından ötürü değişmemi isteme
Siktir et alma, yorgunum orospu, gitmek için gün sayıyorum
Hiphop artık evrensel ve bir marka
Bu sanki bir sirk gibi ve palyaçolar ipin üstünde
Beyaz çocuklar bunu seviyor ve fazlasını istiyorlar
Ama benim mikrofonu elime almam gecenin sessizleşmesi gibi
Yada bir aldatmaca gibi, işte bu yüzden duruşumu koruyorum
Onunla uyumaya gidiyorum ve öğlenden sonra onunla birlikte  uyanıyorum
Yargılanmaktan artık bıktım, bana yargıcı gösterin
Ona 3 yaşından beri işlediğim tüm cinayetleri itiraf edeceğim

[Nakarat & Çıkış]
Eğer bu akşam tutuklanırsam
O zaman bu akşam eve dönemeyebilirim

[Intro]
"Life," by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off
At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not bein' a millionaire

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
After work, in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', "Where hip-hop lives"

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'?
Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just fed up, that's my word



[Intro]
"Life" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
Put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't looking
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around swearing that they was always down
What is life?

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk for this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

[Hook]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum

Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs, wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringing half the skill as me

Y'know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Y'know what I'm saying?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Y'know what I'm saying?

That's my word



[Hook: 50 Cent]
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah, yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I took quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks
Coca-Cola came and bought it for billions, what the fuck?
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes, who the fuck cares?
I'm stanky rich, I'mma die trying to spend this shit
Southsides' up in in this bitch
Yeah, I smell like the vault, I used to sell dope
I did play the block, now I play on boats
In the south of France baby, Saint-Tropez
Get a tan, I'm already black, rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a river rat, shit, fuck the chitter chat
The baker, I bake the bread; the barber, I cut your head
The marksman, I spray the lead, blood clot, chop your leg
Do not fuck with the kid, I get busy with the Sig
I come where you live, ya dig?

[Hook: Eminem]
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
I, I get money, money I got (I Get It)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run this rap shit)
I, I get money, money I got (Now guess who's back)
I, I get money, money I got (You thought I left you)
I, I get money, money I got (Now why would I do that)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (One, Two, Three)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new though
I got rid of my old bitch, now I got new hoes
First it was the Benzo, now I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari, I'm sorry, I keep blowing up
They call me the cake man, the strawberry shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole clique break dance
Backspin, head spin, flatline, you're dead then
9 shells, Mac-10, "who wanna get it cracking?"
I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh, you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they calling me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they calling me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck, man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like bloaw, you like my style
Ha ha - I'm heading to the bank right now

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a Teflon Don, boy, I run New York
When I come outta court, yeah, I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (Yeah)
Whoa, hey (I run New York)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (Yeah, yeah)
Whoa, hey (I run New York) whoa
I get money, money I got
(I'm back on the streets, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm bringing the heat, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm on my grind)
Money I got, money I got
(Like all the time)
I get money, money I got
(Trying to stop my shine)
I get money, money I got
(I'll cock my 9, don't get outta line)
Money I got, money I got
(I said don't get outta line
I-I get it, I-I get it
Yeah, yeah)



[Hook]
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Weezy F matchin with Bird Baby
VRP's, SB's, matchin shirt, maybe
White T, Neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the mob, but im a bachelor baby
Love is in the air, I put on a Gas Mask
I rather be there first, than the ass last
I'm a Gorilla, call me Sasquach
And I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H
Light up the purp, pass it like Steve Nash
Bitch your so hot I give yo ass a heat flash
Young Money boy, I'm on 03' cash
Such a CEO, like my homie D-Dash
Gas... we mash like Pac and the outlaws
And we stand-up, and try not to down-fall
Tryin' to reach my goal, like a round-ball
Freddy'll do anything for the crown y'all

I keep on looking for something I can't get

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dapper Don, Cap' of Queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'mma fucking G?
I'm all automatic when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'mma walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it live it always to the limit[x2]
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits you dig it? 
Me I'm from the street[x2]
We ain't nothing sweet[x2]
The home of the homies
There's a body every week[x2]
Now I don't hear the sirens
But they probably gonna creep[x2]
Plotting to pull me over
Plant the in my jeep
So I'll be skipping cities 7 states in a week
For the wolves follow rules
Don't get moved by the two's blood'll ooze on your shoes
Wait Control your hate, you ain't ridin' in them sixes
Cause you spendin all your on them bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They think they crazy
But they ain't crazy lets face it
Shit basically they just playin sick
They ain't shit they ain't sayin shit
Spray umh 50
A to K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem
You stayin wit me
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin to confuse you
When I let lose wit this uzi
And just shoot through you Isuzu
You get the message
Am I gettin through to you
You know what's comin
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
Take some BIG and some PAC
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin like survivng a shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats
Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds
Away from the towers
Them cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
It's Nuclear showers theres nothin spookier
You're now about to witness the power

[Hook]



[Intro]
Another motherfucking exclusive!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I kissed a boy
And I liked it
The taste of his hairy fat dick

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hahahaha, that's the remix)
Shade 45

[Chorus: Eminem]
I kissed a boy
And I liked it
The taste of his hairy fat dick

[Verse 1: Eminem and Masta Ace]
(Ken Kaniff Voice)
Peace!
I am the man
But I'm not the one with the can in his hand
I'm down with a different kind of street band
And I appear from place to place as the Music Man aka Masta Ace



[Future]
Well Jimmy moved in with his mother
Cuz he ain't got no place to go

[Jimmy]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

[Future]
Cuz you live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

[Jimmy]
Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you

Well my names Jimmy, and his name's Greg Buel
And me him and you went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He tapping my mom, we're almost the same age!
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot mom!
"Here happy birthday Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it"
A 1928 delta, this shit won't even get me to the shelter!
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now

Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you



[Intro: Proof]
Yeeaah! This is DJ Seven Deuce, live at
Club Runyan, where all the girls with burgundy hair get in free
G-Unit in the house! What up baby
Performing live tonight live on stage... Captain Save-A-Ho
And the fabulous Case y'all, stick 'em out y'all
All my Detroit players, let's go!

[Hook: Kon Artis]
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck
I ain't gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned

[Kon Artis]
You damn right, yes I love menage-a-trois
And I got drawers as big as guys's big "wah"
I'm a Trick Daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
That I wouldn't turn my niggas on to you when I hit ya
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk
But your badunkadunk, keep my mind on hump
When my mind's on hump it mean my .9's in the trunk
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
That your man is, and I'm a freak undercover
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother
I got five of them motherfuckers trying to smother me already
We can't go steady, but you can give me head
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shed
My chapped lips will cut nipples when breast fed
And on the way, leave the bread with Achmed
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date
With a fat chick that eat cake on playskates
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grapes
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape

[Hook]

[Swift]
I'mma make this one thing clear
Ain't no woman here gon' ruin my career
All the hell you doing is pursuing a dream
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems
All these hoes be lying, bullshitting each other
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber?
He might as well have went and told the ho that he love her
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother
Or my wife, and my sisters, so motherfuck a mistress
They signing a contract before these bitches hit this
Never will a woman take me out that way
I keep a RCA camera in their motherfucking face

[Hook]

[Bizarre]
What's your name again? It doesn't matter
My name is Bizzy, a bodyguard for Mr. Mathers
Sit down girl, let me get you a drink
I'mma buy you a mink, and rape you on the sink
From day one, I knew you was a ho
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pad

[Kuniva]
These hoes be on some bullshit, always trying to pull shit
Outta they ass, get mad and put you on blast
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you, sucked you, put it on you
Boned you, yapping off with they mouth, saying she loved you
All on your dick, calling your phone, spazzing and shit
Having a fit until you feel like calling it quits
Then she starts calling your chick wanting to fight
Every time you show up at a gig she front row with her friends
Flipping you off follow you to the bar, the bathroom
The parking lot, to the car, pissing you off
Until you blackout, now you and the ho is having a scrap out
You get locked up for assault and now you assed out

[Hook]



[Intro: Busta Rhymes + Eminem]
Yeah! Guess who it is!
Ayo, Dre, I think they in trouble
Whoo!
Scott Storch, why you have to do it like this to 'em?!
Feels like a new day!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Listen, now every time I come
And I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who
‘Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin' zoo
Then I come and I spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view, instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up
And keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and freakin' get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second, check it, I reckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded, that's why your shit is through
You fuckin idiot, I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever, period, every syllable is true

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And if you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo, you do not have a fightin' chance to move you, you were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do, do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin'
You just gon have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze, I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me, my allergies are actin' up; thanks a lot, Scott
You're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
And everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
Under everything up on the block
‘Cause Busta Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
Then with Shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted
We might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody, come on, let's get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet, put something on, and get to the club

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And if you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin' fools
Who got me rumblin' dudes all way down the block
Keep on stumblin' and jumblin' over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel, see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin' out of time, see, I'm tired of all y'all
M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin', n-n-nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your CD player
And turn up the volume
You bang your head, because your shit is not
I continue with crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin'
While I got you tr-tr-tremblin'
Before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing
Then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing, nigga, follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbing and fuck her
Then tell you bitch to get off my yacht

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And if you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…



I need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball
First off, I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Whoa, I'm on a roll, don't get me started
Ellen got pissed at me tried to push me and pussy farted
With such accuracy he aims and he shoots the target
Cupid's arrow and Portia ??? now look, sweetheart it's
The kissin' bandit on a mission to leave, Miss Degeneres
Disenchanted by men now just listen damn it
Miss De Rossi, I need no posse, now single-Hand-ed-ly
Will steal your heart with a kiss
Where should I plant it? Mm-wha! Baby, it's *moi*
And my repertoire's runnin' around in pink panties and leopard bra
And negligar, negligee, you say tomayto I say TOMato
I’m Tommy Mottola Mariah don`t stop me I`m on a roll, ohh
Y'all know what it is



[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 1]
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at 12
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox (Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed
Too upset, it's just too much mess
I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me!
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) "Back is the incredible!"
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it."
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted
I'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

[Chorus]
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 3]
I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}
Stand 'em all in line, add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‘Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‘Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez—and, Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother
I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Outro]
Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, Mom!)
{​​*scratch*}​​ Guess who's back
{​​*scratch*}​​ Gue— {​​*scratch*}​​ guess who's back
D-12 {​​*scratch*}​​ Guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre {​​*scratch*}​​ Guess who's back
Back back {​​*scratch*}​​ back {​​*scratch*}​​
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck



[Intro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
Kay Slay! (Yeah) Yo..
Drama King! (Yeah!)
Check it out, check it out, O. Trice!
(Shady Records nigga, it's going down once again, boy)
It's just a scratch, man (Let's go, Em)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I Murder this Inc as soon as I touch the page
You ain't gon' have no other choice but to rush the stage
And charge the mic, and I hope you got the heart to fight
Cause you gon' have to, cause you ain't got the smarts to write
Something that good, to try to come back at me with
What you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?
You motherfuckers crack me up, talking bout you gonna smack me up
Yall won't even back me up
Throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard
It's like fucking cats de-clawed trying to jack me off
You think I'm afraid? What you trying to throw some fear in me?
You think I'm dumb enough to roll with no security?
I'm doing my best to try to show maturity
But don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
Like it's supposed to be scaring me
Like I won't leap clean over this fucking
V.I.P. rope and throw this chair
At anyone close or near me, trying to approach me physically
Cause he don't spit lyrically
And he knows that my flow's so sick, his ho's on my dick
And he's so sick of hearing me, my posters are staring at him
But I don't think he knows the severity
Of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
If I go hysterically, cause I guarantee
There's no one in here that would resort back childhood
Any quicker than I would, or hit you with plywood
Especially when I'm sipping on this liquor and tonic
One swig of this bottle I'mma go upside your head so hard with it
The mark from it'll be so dark that it'll leave a scar so big
You'll be able to read a label from the motherfucking
Sticker that's on it, I'm sick of the nonsense
Shit is ridiculous and I refuse to let it get to this point
Where I'mma let you sit on my conscience, I'm gone, bitch (YEAH!)

[Hook: Obie Trice]
I'm gone bitch
Shady Records motherfucker, we gone, bitch
I said we gone bitch, so long, bitch
Catch up if you can, we moving on, bitch

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Now who you know been to Kyoto, Tokyo
Off of one debut, screaming, "I'm in Janai yo!"?
Obie Trice, showed you right
He done seen overseas, he's not a prototype (nah)
Nobody's protégé, Em only showed O. the way
Fuck what the media say
If you listen to music then you should know that O. Trice fused it
In a matter where he speaks how the streets views it
Choose, to translate it through the art of music
And started using it reaching the youth
Influenced by the truth in it (truth!)
And as a boy, a man, I ran from boys in vans
Do the knowledge, acknowledge and try to comprehend
Hand full of contraband
A product of my environment, narcotics and violence
Inspires the content, but my intent is
To retire these tired-ass writers in si-lence (yeah!)
Cause haters they hate us cause Shady became famous
And claimed the rap game when they thought he'd be nameless (hah!)
But racist accusations won't change us
Let the truth be told, you think O. will be over here
Like, "Master, show them you got soul!"
No, anybody knows us knows that's not how we roll
So, I still push the bucket
If I ain't trust it I wouldn't fuck with it
But fuck it, I'm gone bitch!



[Narrator]
Torture chambers, secret passageways, vats of acid, and deadly vaults

[Intro]
I said, ohh
Damn, it feels good to be back
I'm having a Relapse

[Eminem]
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail man, what the hell is his problem?
Well to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like everyday I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling vrumm-vrumm?
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum, drum
A head and torso of someone, where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde
Hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there's somethin' wrong, cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on



[Intro: Mike Epps]
All these little young kids ain't got no direction
Shit, these lil' kids is on everything

[Chorus: Mike Epps]
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
I’m on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Henny-Henny, sober don't interest me, I'm on everything
'Bout to sniff the liquor like it's 'caine
That's how high I am, I'm blowed
I take painkillers to ease the pain, though I ain't in pain
No, we ain’t the same – you drunk, I’m on everything
Sick when I kick it, gout, me, soberin' up? Ha! ALF
Cash rules everything, acid tab, hash, 'shrooms
I done woke up with a fuckin' tiger in my bathroom
I am fuckin' (high... high... high... high)
Menace to society, I feel sorry for your mother
Me and Vishis on 'shrooms, call us the Mario Brothers
Back down, we never back down
Never laid out, can't put my back down

[Chorus: Mike Epps]
I'm on; syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Painkillers, I call 'em cane pillars, 'cause to hold me up
When I take 'em, I need a cane and pillars, I'm on everything
Sick when I kick it – barf!
Me, sobering up? (fart noise) Fart!
I crush your brain like a pill crusher, let's crush a pill, yeah
Fuck, I think I just crushed my last Tylenol 3 up
Grab the key up off the counter to the camper, left the crib
Man, who'da knew that three in the morning I'd still be up?
Could barely see up over the steering wheel, crashed the whip
Tore a tree up, on my way to the dealer’s, tryna re-up
Call me Brett Favre, spell it F-A-V-R-E, yup
It’s wrong, in other words, I just fucked my RV up!
Bitch, it’s on again, yeah, break that Klonopin in half
While I smoke some chronic in the cab with Donovan McNabb
And I dye my hair back blonde again and laugh
I’m the real macaroni, you cheesy bitch
I’m demonic with the Kraft
There’s a devil in my noodle, you – angel hair pasta
Flow's dreaded like some fuckin' tangled hair Rasta-farian Jamaican, relax, man, I’ll send a fuckin' axe at you
If you insist on a fuckin' accent
Bad and Evil is back with an epidural, check ya girl
'Cause after we prop you up, we're proppin' her up
So, baby, come put ya feet up in these stirrups
Your boyfriend better find another fuckin' hornets' nest to stir up
We rap like we’re on

[Chorus: Mike Epps]
I'm on; syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)
I'm on; syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, hah-hah-huh, hah-hah
(I'm on everything, I'm on everything
I'm on everything, I'm on everything)

[Interlude: Royce Da 5’9”]
I’m on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, speed
Henny – heh, classic!

[Verse 3: Royce da 5’9”]
"It’s Eminem and him again," my sentiments exactly
I told that bitch to get at me, then the bitch attacked me
Kid you not, I’m lit up as fuck
Tablecloth tucked in my pants 'til I'm hearing dishes drop
As I walk away from my dinner with schmucks

[Verse 4: Eminem and Royce da 5’9”]
Then I enter the front of the K-Mart shopping center
With a coupon book and a hundred and ten bucks
And a bunch of change, and a wife beater with a mustard stain
I’ll crush your brain like I’m crushin' pills
What the fuck’s the mothafuckin' deal?
This shit’s making me feel like
I’m tryna do a mothafuckin' cartwheel up a hill
How many bars? How many tabs of A-C-I-D? Y-E-S
'Cause I'm sniffin' M-Y E-X, F-U-C-K'd up, and it’s obvious
Smoke and Henny in my chest, I’m B-A-N-A-N-A-S
I’m a C-O-C-O-N-U-T, put this CD in, then you’ll see
The sequel to "Scary Movie"
Bad is to Evil, a roofie to Roethlisberger
You don't wanna wind up six feet deep under that shit's creek
So I hope that you bought preservers
You could put a turd on the plate
Silverware and a tablecloth to serve us
You don’t bring shit to the table
I'm in your grill like a Seville when the moth gets murdered
You're pushin' the envelope
When I’m shovin’ that whole post office further
Right off the surface of this earth
Into the darkest and the farthest corners

[Verse 5: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
How many bars? How many bars? Maui Wowie, Sour Diesel
How many jars to all my people I’ll be to Mars, mommy, come on
She can actually wrap my nutsack
'Round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall
Or she could just puke from sippin' this piss
From my 24-inch catheter cord
I’m the type that’ll take a bath with a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
While I’m stashing her in the back, smacking her forehead
On the dash 'til it's accidentally blowin', the Benz Jeep horn
My friends be knowin' that when I’m on a binge, I’m stingy
Even when I’m ten deep in a room at the MGM
With Lindsay Lohan and she on

[Outro: Mike Epps]
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed "Fuck the world"
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ahh, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid mothafuckas think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Outro]
I told you I was Shady (Yup)
Y'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I'm Shady
And that's my name



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Verse 1]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
(Slim Shady...) so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'mma come and kill you

[Hook]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady...) I'm Shady!



[Intro: Busta Rhymes, Eminem & 50 Cent]
Exclusive! Clinton Sparks shit!
Shady, Aftermath, still Aftermath 2006-(a million)
Y'all niggas need to be clear real quick
The motherfuckin' game has changed again (Haha)
MixUnit.Com (G-Unit) a new day nigga

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & 50 Cent]
Too often, is a young nigga, in a coffin
Tryna blossom, got shot down walkin', heh
Bleek a high-to-hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?
(*Gunshots*) They done shot my baby!

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
(Ooh) Pardon Me (ooh) back in the room again
It's time to raise the level of the boom again
(Now who's that?) Bus-A-Bus-A-Bus ra-(*growl*)
See, I ain't do that in a long time
Spit shit, make the streets do more crime
Cop some cribs, top a little more shine
Alright, yeah (Shhh, mmm) I pity y'all
Da way I bang niggas and how I shit on y'all
And spit the slang, big 'em, make your label quit on y'all
And do my thang bitch, from here to Senegal
We gettin' a lotta money, me and my friend Kamal
I take yo money (*spitting sound*) I ain't a friend of y'all *Gunshot*
So much class, my shit'll kill ya, black
(*Imitated gunfire*) when I don't wanna rap
And still I'ma smash and make them bitches make it clap
Soon as i'm finished wit' her homie, I'll give her back

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We don't play that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
(Bitch ass niggas)
We don't play  that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
(Bangin' off his shit)
We don't play  that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
(Murk you nigga)
We don't play  that, we don't play that
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playin'
Get familiar!



[Intro]
Yeah.. YEAH.. YEAH!

[Verse 1]
Lil' Tyrone tired of gettin' his ass whipped, so he holdin' that gat down
His momma think it's my fault, 'cause he listened to Back Down
Bobby was a fuckin' bum, he pumpin' packs now
He need some fresh chicks, white tees and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock a wino, he won't put the 'gnac down
Eric had the jump shot, but he's smokin' crack now
The Lunatics, the Lost Boyz, Cheeks shit is whack now
Country blew trial, them crackers got him on his back now
And Sean {*ka-click*} runnin' round with his fuckin' gat now
Up in niggas cribs, sayin' "where that money at pal?"
Now Sandra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch traveled the world, she runnin' round boostin'
Now Toya got these bad-ass kids, they a nuisance
Her baby daddies never come around, they useless
Every now and then I come through on some new shit
Pearly white 6 or some chrome deuce-deuces

[Chorus]
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me

[Verse 2]
When I was six, man, momma told me God don't like ugly
I fell, scraped my face, and thought God must don't love me
Saw Owen every morning before school, he sell dope
Niggas keep whuppin' Nut ass 'cause he sell soap
Charlie be beggin' all the time, he stay broke
Flip be down on 1-0-9, rollin' up smoke
Shameek, he a thief, catch a stunt in a stolen car
He that nigga that you call when you crashin' into a bar
See they love me 'cause I rap now, but they don't like me
I been locked up three times and they ain't write me
Stevie a punk, but fuck what he say, he can get mean quick
Pop shots at you, Esau must suck a mean dick
The block's hot, D's jump out on us almost all the time
They watch us from the building but niggas still be on the grind
Wayne used to call the cops and tell them G had a 9
Til G put that gun in Donrad seat and said it wasn't mine

[Chorus]
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me



[Intro]
Ah-ha man! Ayy you know where them niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin' (Uh-huh), straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse 1]
This is not new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old MAC, new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my TEC
Go on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' with son
'Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse 2]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
Yeah!

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Return of the PLK brought me the feedback
And Halloween Havoc showed niggas I could repeat that
They need that, so lay your seat back and pay attention
And follow me through volume three, honorable mention

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
They don’t make niggas like they used to, I’m livin' proof
Making a killin' off a sinnin' 'cause I give 'em truth
When I ain’t puttin' that crack down I’m spinnin' coupes
Soup hot, I’m winter-proof; them niggas wouldn’t get a tooth
I hit the switch, tint the roof; famous cause I flip the booth
Dangerous, what a hit produce; I body you and get the Juice
Ask them if they cakin', you probably ain’t gon get the truth
From me? I’m hella honest, went Ferrari when I flipped the coupe
Sorry but we got' ta', party with the choppa'
Ammo en mi casa, come slippin' and we got' cha'
Drippin' blood and pasta, confine the boxers
I be in shackles while my mama watch us till they pick a time to drop us
Excellent when I jam, I’m a pro at this
Golden gift, grimy as the niggas I been rollin' with
Lil' man hold the fifth, heavy over loaded piff
Chevy over chromey lips, catch me with your homie bitch
In a swollen six, diamond flooded Rolly wrist
Shinin' was my only wish, I shoulda' wished for more
If the club a place for fun then what you bring your pistol for?
All these dummies in denial, when drama pop this shit to floor
Money comin' by the pile, we Water Moccasins to law
C-notes in the liquor store, speed boats on a different shore
A nigga tell you I ain’t the one, then he don't know nuttin'
I bet he change his opinion, you let him hold summin'
I’m in a Rove, stuntin'
Wheels back to back
From a block away or more you’d think I had the traffic packed
Shawtys rest in Cadillac, can’t hold they asthma back
Niggas talkin' mills now, they ain’t made half o' that
Me I’m in the hood for real, right there where they trappin' at
Right there where it happens at, all familiar habit
My habits are, carrots y’all, sexin' in the fastest car
Green gang mastermind, nine levels past the bar
Pass the torch, niggas don't deserve and never pass the porch
I am what they leechin' off
PAP! Get them bastards off
Gettin' rock in the rap game, they top guys pageant soft
Talkin' like a murder when he wouldn’t knock a rabbit off
Catch me out in Madison on my automatic horse
My word play magical, I millimeter gataloff
You won’t have a career after I shatter yours
Then splatter his with my overwhelming averages

Streets ain’t a game nigga
I was born by myself but I ain’t going how I came nigga
Cause Imma take a couple with me if they get me
I’m tipsy and fuckin' high as hell off of sticky
Come on if you with me, I’m strong in the city
I’m never by myself, I got the chrome ridin', dig me?
Rest in peace to Pac
Rest in peace to Biggie
The industry been shiny, now let’s increase the gritty



[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
"Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!" ‘cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
(Till forever, till forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and to your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral
Is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
‘Cause there's a monster real in me
That always wants to kill emcees
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool
Then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, ‘cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 1]
Niggas screw they face up at me
On some real shit son they don’t want beef
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain’t a shell left in my heat
Y’all niggas better lay down, yeah, I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain’t gon’ make it
You niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
I’m from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you’re on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I wanna fuck
Gimme a second I’mma holla, I’mma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

[Chorus]
In my hood niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood a little ’dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act
In my hood niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood

[Verse 2]
I don’t trust a muh’fuckin soul
When the D’s come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I’m from it ain’t safe to have more than a eighth
Niggas’ll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo’ case
Co-operate, or Doc’ll have to operate
Niggas I’ll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggas’ll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas are lurking, you’ll have to catch ’em and merk ’em
I’m observing in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I’m a hustler, how the fuck I’m ’sposed to eat when it’s hot?

[Chorus]
In my hood niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood a little ’dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act
In my hood niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood

[Verse 3]
The house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that’s what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggas where I’m from don’t wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain’t good to do good in my hood
*Click-clack, blam* You know not to do good now

[Chorus]
In my hood niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood a little ’dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act
In my hood niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause see, they call me a menace
And if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference
They're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘Cause here we go, he's Jigga, Jigga, Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'—

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one

[Hook: Chester Bennington]
Now in my remains (one by one)
Are promises that never came (one by one)
Set this silence free (one by one)
To wash away the worst of me (one by one)

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Like an army falling (one by one, one by one)
One by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one

[Verse 1]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
"We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest," the next day my mother said
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead"
"Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course unless you object"
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head"

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 2]
"Did you get him?" Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? ("Yeah") Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady, what the fuck you saying?" I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting
"Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being"
No, Dad, I said no — I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene"

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
I love getting shit started. I instigate a peace talk
Into a beef talk until police need chalk
To chalk you up. Have bitches walking up
Smacking you in your face; screaming that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Ran his pockets and stuck him
'Til they gather in front of your crib, guns and long clips
Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies that's so believable
You'll run and grab your shotguns, Glocks and nines
Walking blind; excite fights until they erupt
Instigate my own death 'cause killing you ain't enough

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not: I'll squeeze first
I'mma heat up your spot; I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets every day, snatching nigga's yay
How you bitches needing work, you can get it from McVay
I'm just spiteful. I tie a ho; a maniacal foul animal
Liable to leave you strapped with your bible
I'm psycho; my bullets won't fly by you
You wanna kill me? You got the right to
Ain't gotta wait 'til night to snipe you: if I don't like you
You getting hit in broad daylight with a white rifle
In front of your window: I'm looking right through
I love when I see a nigga get stuck

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
(I'm an instigator) Drama tends to follow me, I know
I probably owe all of my friends apologies
Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me
Get a lobotomy; nigga, this one's to my arteries
Guns are a part of me: I pack more than pottery
I ought'a be jailed for depicted mockery
Egg on fights to plot on the niggas that shot at me
I don't twist the truth I just make it Gothic, see
I'm nothing but a liar with a big-ass mouth
Dick and fists big enough to knock your bitch-ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you, I rap with him but I don't like Proof

[Verse 4: Proof]
Nigga, fuck you. Me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you
(I'm an instigator) Convince a tenth-grader
To run up inside his classroom and leave the kids [sprayed up]
Bitch, straight-up. This is the season
For squeezing off triggers on niggas for no reason
Either jump or quit running your mouth
Pull a gun out, better use it 'til the bullets run out

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

[Verse 5: Swifty McVay]
I throw a brick at your crib, have you standing on the porch Screaming "Look what you did!" I ain't feeling no remorse
Nigga, just pick up the kids. Swift got first dibs
With these cherry-hot slugs that'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparing deathbeds. Quick to bust lead
While I'm staring at the Feds, tearing off they legs
Once you drop dead, they'll be swearing it's a plague
I'm sicker than a coke Rastafarian with dreads
You get shanked if you move; ditched with no clues
Dopest shit on yo' tape was yo' skits and interludes
And once I finish you, they wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts, so you hoes ain't got the guts to interview

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me

[Outro: Swifty McVay]
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator
I'm an instigator



Angie:  It's Hot 97, and I got my man on the phone. You know 7 billion dollars first week in at the box office, on 8 Mile. Can we have one time please Eminem *clapping* is on the telephone.

Eminem:  Angie, Angie, Angie. *Angie laughing* What's up?

Angie:  Wh.. why the stress in your voice?

Eminem:  Wh.. why the stress?

Angie:  Yeah?

Eminem:  No distress.

Angie:  You know what I have to say to you before we talk about anything, just congratulations man 'cause..

Eminem:  Thank you Angie, you too!

Angie:  Thank you man!

Eminem:  They're banging the single out here. They're banging.

Angie:  I was in Detroit two days ago, I like it there.

Eminem:  Yeah, I told them to!

Angie:  Oh that's what it was? *Laughing*

Eminem:  I told em' to!

Angie:  I actually.. I actually used the "Lose Yourself" instrumental to come out to.. I figured you know, I was in your town, it would work, it was big for me

Eminem:  Well right, being the [?] I figured that was the right thing to do

Angie:  Yeah yeah, thank you. No man, but the 8 Mile thing just you know, just received so well and just, you know, and incredible job man, so congratulations on all that

Eminem:  Thank you I've had a beautiful time

Angie:  So how you feeling man? What's [?] some [?]

Eminem:  I'm good, success is good, everything is..

Angie:  I'm not used to this side of you

Eminem:  You're not used to this side?

Angie:  No *Laughing*, you sound very grown up

Eminem:  Um, I'm growing up a little bit, I'm trying


Angie:  Alright, talk to me man, what the hell is going on?

Eminem:  Alright, I did.. first of all, I want to make a little comment, you know, I just want to comment on this whole thing that's going on, this little, this little whatever it..

Angie:  Feud?

Eminem:  Yeah, this little feud.

Angie:  I saw it on MTV yesterday, it's official now!

Eminem:  It's crazy!

Angie:  You and Benzino..

Eminem:  First time he's ever been on TV, I want to congratulate him. The first time he's ever been on MTV and he did 106 & Park, so I want to congratulate him on that too.

Angie:  So he's getting public.

Eminem:  I'm definitely bringing a lot of success to this man, but you know what, like honestly, like this dude, I buried him already. He's speaking from the grave Angie, this dude is speaking from the grave.

Angie:  Oh would you be referring to the song on the Green Lantern Mixtape?

Eminem:  I'll be referring to, I'd be referring to the one, the new one that he has. The newest one, the.. the one with the.. the fake "Victory" beat. I think he calls it “I Lost”…

Angie:  Oh the one Benzino did? Right right, but you then came on the, I the joint I heard came from you was on the Green Lantern Mixtape

Eminem:  Yeah see, I'm gonna tell you the story what happened

Angie:  Okay

Eminem:  He dissed me on a record, I didn't respond right, I didn't respond. Then he dissed me again, went back in the studio again. I think he was mad that I didn't respond.

Angie:  He finally..

Eminem:  Not that it didn't hit my radar 'cause this dude owns half of The Source  magazine. That's why it hit my radar, but my manager, once again, Paul Rosenberg, you know, tried to talk me out of it. "Don't respond, it's not worth it". The second time he did it I said "You know what, I'm gonna let him have it". So I gave it to him. Two songs.. two songs, to his two songs.

Angie:  Right

Eminem:  Now this next time, now I already buried him. I put the nail in the coffin, I kick the dirt on his grave.

*Eminem with muffled voice imitating the buried Benzino*

"This [?] is [?].. I'm never gonna get out! Somebody please let me out!"

Angie:  *Laughing*

Eminem:  He's done. And all the stuff that, you know, all this.. all this gangster shit that he wants to talk, mr. Tough Guy and this and that. Let me tell you something. This dude talks about killing my daughter on the record, he does not want to take it there, he does not? want to take it there. If he really wanted to take it there, and take it on a street level, like he's saying and screaming and jumping up and down in his records he would.. he would not have went back in the studio 'cause a mic can't fight you back dawg, a mic cannot fight you back. He would not have went back in the studio..

Angie:  Okay okay, would.. okay. Ca.. can I just take it back to the beginning with the first song where he came at you. Just the jump off to this whole thing..

Eminem:  It's not a song.

Angie:  A freestyle.

Eminem:  It's not even a free.. I hope to God he was freestyling 'cause if he wrote that, I really feel bad.

Angie:  Alright, let's you took, uhm, I'm talking of exhibit A. The first thing from Benzino. Di.. did you, I mean, did something happen to spark that between you and him, did anything happen, I mean..

Eminem:  Angie, i swear on my daughter's life, I never met this dude, I never met this man, this girl in my life. I never met this woman, she is obsessed with me. I can.. I cannot understand it, you know what it is? I think that.. I think Angie, a lot of times being that I've been out for like, you know, the last four years or whatever, I think people are starting to forget a little bit, that I came from the bottom

Angie:  *Softly* Mhm, right

Eminem:  You know what I'm saying? I took those cards and I remember Denaun.. Kon Artist from D12 told me some deep shit the other day. He said: "Remember when we was flipping burgers at Gilbert's, and you was mad, you was always punching walls and breaking mirrors, and saying "I can't get a deal 'cause I'm white, can't get a deal, I'm white I'm white, it's 'cause I'm white, it's 'cause I'm white". And then I took the cards I was dealt in life, and I flipped them. I flipped the cards and now I'm selling so many records because I'm white, you know what I'm saying?

Angie:  Right.. Right

Eminem:  So I flip the cards I was dealt, but this dude is a fat 40 year old, shriveled up, wrinkled prune, with a big puffy.. big puffy clown hair. So take them cards you were dealt with and say that in your rap, flip them cards. You know what I'm saying? Take them cards that you're dealt. Stop being mad at me, stop concentrating on my life so much and get one on your own.

*Hot 97. com the hottest hiphop spot on the web!*

Angie:  Is it fair to say that you are, not just from Benzino, but just in general, like you're just tired of hearing people beef about that?

Eminem:  I'm sick of the excuses, that everybody making excuses, like if people must not listen to my songs, like in "White America", like I clown about it. You know what I'm saying I.., but the truth of the matter is that I flip the card Angie, I flip the card. Everybody has a set of cards you're dealt with in life, then flip them. You got to take them cards and flip them. If he doesn't have.. is smart to flip them cards, don't blame me. Don't blame me 'cause you suck. This dude, Angie, I think could very well, after hearing his last record, I truly believe, and I'm not even exaggerating, this dude, could possibly be the worst rapper in the world.

Angie:  In your opinion?

Eminem:  In a lot of people's opinion. Well I'm serious like I've never, I've never thought I would see the day where I met or heard, the whackest rapper in the world. I've heard a lot of whack rappers, but he very well, possibly could be, the worst rapper in the world, going against one of the best. And that's not to say, to toot my own horn, I.. I.. I.. never would consider myself the best, if anything.

Angie:  Do you.. do you not?

Eminem:  No.

Angie:  'Cause some people would right now consider you, right now, the best out.

Eminem:  I would not consider myself best out.

Angie:  Who is?

Eminem:  You got Jay-Z, you got Nas, you got Fifty. All of them guys, all of them cats, Redman, all of them guys, are.. are the best at what they do and, you know what I'm saying? I think a lot of times, maybe it, I don't know, maybe it bugs some people's mind a little bit, that I'm not only.. I'm not only rapping, but I'm making the beats too now. I'm making the beats, I'm doing the producing, you know what I'm saying?

Angie:  At least you're getting a lot of money, some people get tight about that man.

Eminem:  It' not even, Angie, it's not even about the money, because I have yet to charge for a track.

Angie:  Really?

Eminem:  I did a track for Jay, I didn't charge. I did a track for Nas, I did a track for Xzibit, I don't even charge for the tracks. I'm free! If I respect you as an artist, and I like your shit, I'm gonna give you a track, I'm gonna give it to you. 'Cause to me it's not about the money, it's about hip hop.

*Hot 97 - Hot 97 - Hot 97.com*


Angie:  Eminem is still on the phone, I have a million questions about the whole 50 Cent thing, but let's pick up where we left off before, just for a second.

Eminem:  Going back to what we was talking about, as far as just..

Angie:  If you just tuned in Eminem is on the phone. He's kinda talking about his side, his perspective on this whole thing that happened with Benzino and..

Eminem:  You know, I guess. They say... they say this when you.. when you hit forty, that you go through your second childhood, so I think that is what this man is going through. It's the second childhood, but I haven't got there yet.

Angie:  Did you ever speak.. Have you ever spoken to him?

Eminem:  I've never even spoke to this man, you can't speak to him, because he record conversations. I might.. what if.. what if I call this man and I threaten him over the phone

Angie:  How do you know that? How do you know that?

Eminem:  Huh?

Angie:  How do you know that?

Eminem:  Because he took a tape. He called Paul and was taping, was taping Paul the whole time, and Angie, you know Paul. Paul's not a fighter. It's Paul's job to de-escalate the situation, so he took that screaming at Paul, and put that on the beginning of his song.

Angie:  *To someone in the studio* You heard that thing?

Eminem:  Now this man is not talking to me, he's talking to my manager, it's my manager's job to de-escalate the situation. I'm on probation. Paul has seen before how I've reacted to certain things and thought he was doing the right thing, by trying to squash it. This dude trying to play dirty pool

Angie:  Wow

Eminem:  What this dude is, I think it's a mid-life crisis Angie, he's going through a mid-life crisis. He's done everything from Will Smith records, to "Rock The Party", trying to come back to the streets.

Angie:  Is he really getting under your skin? No, I mean I can't, I mean..

Eminem:  The only reason.. The only reason that I responded to this clown in the first place, is because of the extortion that is going on between him and Dave Mays. Nobody wanted to address it. Everybody in the business you talk to, any rapper in the business, and I'm not gonna put you on the blast Angie, but we all know what's going on at The Source. Ray Benzino has Dave Mays shook. And you can't play two sides of the fence, you can't be a rapper... you can't be a rapper and own a magazine... own half of a magazine. Because then what happens is, you call rappers that you like, you call them and you want them to make a guest appearance on your album, and if they don't want to do it because you suck. He's gonna  then he's gonna shut you out of his magazine, so you can't play both sides of the fence like that. You just can't do it.

Angie:  So that's what motivated you to see...

Eminem:  That's what motivated me..

Angie:  Was that something that was bothering you, before he started getting at you?

Eminem:  You know what used to bother me it's been.. it's been the mic.. the mic rating system in The Source. Like, when I was a kid growing up in the early 90's on hip hop, The Source as we used to know it, was the bible of hip hop. Like what... it was... their word was gold. If somebody got a four mics you was going to cop it. If somebody got five mics you was going to cop it. If somebody got three and a half, yeah, you know, you wouldn't know, but their word was gold and it was usually right. Now what's happened is this dude is doing the mic rating system, he even said so in his song "The five mic giver". I give the mic, I distribute the mics, but I'm a rapper too. You can't do that. He's fucking the game up and like...

Angie:   I know that you have yet to receive a five mic review in The Source. Is that something that has...

Eminem:  I have yet to receive even a four and a half. Everybody gets a four, everybody, like that's the standard now, that's the standard. If you get a four and a half that must mean that Benzino wants you on his album, you know what I'm saying? And as far as my contribution to hip hop, him calling me a culture stealer and an invader and all that stuff. As far as my contribution to hip hop. How was my contribution to hip hop any different than Dave Mays and Jonathan Shecter when they started The Source twelve-thirteen years ago, was to make hip-hop bigger and expand it. If I can take hip hop and open more white people's ears to hip hop so that artists like Nelly, and Ja Rule, and Jay-Z, and Cameron, and Ludacris and Nas can sell more records, then that's my contribution to hip hop. You know what I'm saying?

Angie:  Right

Eminem:  I'm just.. I'm only.. I'm only.. being real and I swear to you Angie, this dude can.. can.. he can scrounge up change and call you from a payphone after this interview and he can.. can scream, he can jump up and down and scream all he want, he can make... go in the studio and make a hundred thousand more records about me, and base his whole life around mine, I will not make another song about this man. He cannot afford to pay the bill when I [?] for the studio time. Then he owes me back. This dude is so whack, I can't even get D12 to do a song about him. They're screaming at me like "why are you even giving this guy the energy?" Because unfortunately I'm in a position where the more attention I pay to something, the bigger it get.

Angie:  So how you gonna... how you gonna... how you gonna not now. What if the dude just keeps making song after song after song, and every now and then he say something that get on your nerves, you just not responding anymore?

Eminem:  I'm done. Anything he does from.. from now on
*Eminem in muffled voice* "Will be like this" Speaking from the grave, I buried him, I buried him, I put the nail in the coffin, I threw the dirt on the top of his grave. I don't even think I'll put him in the coffin, I think I just buried him in a hole and threw the dirt on his grave.

Angie:  What happens if you see this dude man?

Eminem:  What happens if I see him?

Angie:  Yeah?

Eminem:  I'm on probation. I'm on probation, so I really would not like to comment on that, but I will let it be known that I got three months left of probation.

Angie:  Alright, but you don't want to jeopardize any of this..

Eminem:   No, I'm not trying to yo. I'm trying.. yo I'm trying to stay in the studio, I'm trying to release my records, make my artists big and spend time with my little girl.

*Hot 97.com Hip Hop's hottest spot on the web*

Angie:  Your song is No.1 today...

Eminem:  That's a beautiful thing.

Angie:  How do you decide who you respond to?

Eminem:   If I get 10 people coming to me on the street saying why is such & such dissin' you, if it gets to the point where I hear it everywhere I go. But this woman here, she is done... she is outta my life.



[Intro: Yelawolf & Eminem]
(In this world, in this world!)
Yeah, aight Marshall, uh
(Well, I'm think you can tell 'em today)
Who am I? (Yelawolf)
(And now you need to bring 'em into this world!)

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!

[Verse 1]
In this world of sticks, hicks and chicks with aqua net spray
Shhh-shut up motherfucker don’t disrespect these country ways, yeah!
Alabama, if yeen know, I ain’t hiding a damn thing, I just like to lean low
Yeah, I’m the theme show stereotypical beanpole
Slim, tall, tatted, let me add that I gotta green glow
From all the Mountain Dew that I consume from a mason jar
In a racing car, chase it with a tall ice brew
Let me not leave you confused, what I represent culturally
Trash bag full of freon, I’m huffin’ puffin’ on potpourri
That gummo’s squeaky swingin’ gate in front of that trap house
Trailer park is sewed up and Billy done pulled that ac out

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!

[Verse 2]
Wonder what I got inside this Chevrolet Trunk I’m hiding
About ten Bodies on a fishing line with baby clothes on consignment
Came to the Game so broke that I still find one-dollar bills and get a thrill
That’s the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd
Siding on the single-wide got icicle steel, too cold
Got a kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf?
Daddy’s in jail again for shuffling pills, we know
Man I’ve only come to give you a peep show, (In this world)
I run across the South Like a wild stream, smiling
I’ve seen more colorful mushrooms than a child’s dream on an island
Desolate left behind, cause my state is a state of grime
God said, 1979, go change the minds (In this world)

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!

[Verse 3]
Yelawolf, Hi my name is
President O' Bama, I’m so shameless
I’m taking it all, so what am I saying?
I’m the voice of every small town (In this world)
Like a light in the pipe, with a mic
And take flight in this life, I'm a sight
Put a vice-grip lock on my right to fight
Despite the way you may feel about sights and sounds
That I might put down, about prices found on a sack of that white
Heaven is a place in a 7/11, I can never get away from hell
Found hell in the bible-belt, and found love in a 6-pack on the shelf
Went to the seashore to see more, but Leroy didn’t seem sure to me
So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat and bought the tee
Converted him y’all, I gave him convertible thoughts
When he saw that big buck hangin’ on the wall (Yeah)
I’m off by a millimeter, I’m on by a million light-years and 2 liters
A pint of moonshine, I ride in two-seaters
Take a ride (In this world)

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!



[2Pac]
Yes, it's the pinnacle of all new thoughts. Now this is the next level with this new album

Hey yo, here's a song for the ladies...



[Intro]
*CD opening*
To all my fans
Love 50 Cent
Happy Valentine’s Day, hmmm…
*Reading CD back*
*Gun shots and screams*
*Bullet shell is dropping*



"So let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?"
{*scratching*} What is this? What is this?

[Intro]
The Invasion! (Invasion yeah)
Green Lantern! The infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch, with Obie Trice!
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!

[Verse: Eminem]
Whoa, here we go, I shoulda' known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates into some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
"Stomping in my Air Force Ones"
But you won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have P!nk tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the Jigga-J-Jigga
Wit a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy

[Hook: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records, we the label fa' sho!
We the realest label
Don’t try to act like you don’t feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, we gon' kill your fuckin' label fa' sho!

[Post-Hook: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months {*gun cocked*}

[Outro]
Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
Cause we do. We see y'all
But we just gon' sit back for a minute
While I see what the FUCK y'all do



[Intro: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! …Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn’t (A) mean and (B) just ain’t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my—

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh



[Intro]
Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember

[Verse 1]
There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 2]
I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 3]
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard "The Knack"
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a *Muslim* too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Outro]
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt



[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them


Verse 1 Lil B:
15,16 started off a young man
Head in another place no Myspace
Older dudes run around with guns on they hip
Berkely California man I got love for that shit
Everyday I stay awake cos I'm thinking when they coming
Old friends who grew up with
Really can't trust them
Man the cops is watching me
So you really can't bust him
Looking all through your emails
Reading your discussions
What's to believe they talking about illuminati
And the secret government that allegedly inside it
Man I'm sitting in my circle
Blowing blunts to the head
I'm just trying to live my life
And not in up jail or dead
Probation laws got me tripping all off the feds
All this was over funds and some motherfucking gas
While its people in the world who ain't got no fucking passion
I can see it in my rear-view
I'm finna break this glass

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them

Verse 2 Lil B:
I still so based
And people still in panic
What going on
I just don't understand it
Some people fake
And some of them underhanded
Some underrated
Most of them stranded
I wish life had a guide and came with a pamphlet
To show me where to go
And the things that is tragic
Who really knows what you doing everyday
And if you made the wrong moves that lead to your fate
And tell me about them asses
And how we eat in classes
The first time offenders
That's never given chances
And the people need justice
The one's living honest
We go ? man
And they ever take my life man
I give you the promise
I did it for the love
Never for the dollars
Stay based for life
And minimize the losses
I realize that I'm a living prophet
We are gods

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them



[Verse 1: Eminem]
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many piggybacked off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lives
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Since B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling "God bless"
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'mma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga (nigga)



[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah it's the talk of New York (yeah yeah yeah nigga!)
Mixed with that N.W.A. shit (whattup - real talk of New York nigga)

You kiddin me? My victory is in the jaws of defeat
And these haters wanna kill me cause my dreams is reality
The cig' with the beam will cause a fatality
Just caught a case but it's a minor technicality
With shooters on the street, prosecutors keep houndin me (break it down now!)
Whatchu know about, Grammy speeches, sandy beaches
Pounds of seedless, pounds and sweepers
Movie features, groupie divas, deal with sneakers
Secluded in the woods from them snakes and leeches (yeah!)

While you on the silver horse witcha Metro pass (what nigga)
For every dollar you make nigga I make a G

But it's political, my paper sproutin

My choice of occupation make her doubtin

I'm about anythang, that'll make a mountain
Of this moolah; ooh all the cake I'm countin
See the game too deep, I can't shake I'm scoutin

[Eminem talking]
Yeah
I just want to take the time out to basically say
Rest In Peace to Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope, Aftermath

Everybody who’s basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys

Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me

The whole city of Detroit
8 mile road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
Haha
So

[Intro: Proof & Eminem]
Check it out!
Hey, Kyu!

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 1: Eminem]
One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried, and leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be plannin' this stuff
'Cause I'm still strugglin' hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of
Damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up
The minute shit hits the fan, it erupts
I'm antein' up, double or nothin'
I've been troubled enough and
I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
See, my destiny's to rest at ease
'Til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you
When you're steppin' on turf, Kyu

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for keeps
Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheap
Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth
Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughterin' house
Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always gropin' a mess of flyin' over the nest
To sellin' dope with the rest
I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets
I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do well on this Earth
But it's been hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here



It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To Receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you
While you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired an arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment

Switch is ridiculous
Locks is twisted like a block
She said "Visit us

Kids, a whip, a ton of cannabis?"
So I can-can it on a cannoe
Sippin coconuts like its a can of some brew
I'm what she plan to hold on to

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Way she move, got me in her hypnotic ways
Her voice manuevers, got me thinking bout her day to day
See I'm faced with beauty, there's nothing more for me to say
Put on the dance floor and play with Obie
And it's no cliche, O's great like the lake
So she Pon da River, her way of doing the snake
Jamaican Girl, make a true playa break
Say it ain't so, ya truth is fate
Incense lit when she's interested in insertion
Any minute ya squirting, she gifted in
Giving you the business, hurting em
Plus she know that art of perversion [she say]

[Chorus: Brick & Lace]
I just want you in my arms, Obie
Hold you till the morning, Obie

[Intro: Sample]
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!

[Woman's voice: (Talking over the singing)]
Jealous?! What he mean "jealous"?
Know what I'm sayin'? He just mad ‘cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm sayin'?
Girls don't buy him no clothes
He bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes
That nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere
He ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean…

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I come home every single day from workin' double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me
When you kiss me, then you diss me
And we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things
So what's a man to do
When all I hand to you is handed back to me?
You act to be this gangsta bitch
That ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company
Now you’re always pumpin' me for information
And you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
‘Cause every accusation
Makes me wanna smack your face in
See, I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check 'em in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in
I need my second wind—say what?!

[Hook: Sample x8]
Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!

[Woman's Voice: (Talking over singing)]
Fuck you and what you going through! Fuck Eminem!
He just mad ‘cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothin' but minus money
Immature, me? Nigga ain't got no dick
No swang in his thang, know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad ‘cause I'm gettin' it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'm talkin' about
Motherfucker just tryin' to get this pussy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started followin' your feetprints
And tappin' in your phone conversations
Through the heat vents—it made complete sense
There's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you, "Who was Mike?"
And you was like, (I need a new nigga)
"Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow."
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock
But now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, "You didn't want me to see yo' hon
Don't want me now, take the towel, wipe your brow!"
Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now your tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'all—fellas, sing it!

[Hook: Sample x12]
Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!



(dialing tone)

[Eminem and (Jesse)]
*Ends off I'm Shady snippet and instrumental still plays*

[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Maaaaan! Let's go
Hey yo, Fif'!
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em...
It's time to hate us again
We're back!
Haha!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See, if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads
A little bit like The Boy Who Cried Wolf, yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts, right out the sky, go bad
From out of nowhere, you might just find your career
Come to it, (Eek!) and I'm just like (Oh, yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention, but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like "Go get 'em"
And I'm just like "Why you're tryin' to fight momentum?"
We just keep winnin', by landslides, oh, and um
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say "Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
Meanwhile, your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y, yes, sir!
So full of joy, boy, am I absurd?
Even Chingy would tell you: "Yeah, boy, don't curr"

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is G-Unit at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Your homie got clapped on, man, I don't care
The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is, dawg, man life's not fair
Your friends should've known not to front 'round here
Listen, kid, where I'm from,  the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man, I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man, you can catch a hot one like outta nowhere
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak, man, sometimes we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Haha, haha
Yeah!
It's the Re-Up!
Haha
God, I love it
You know you hate that laugh, don't you?
Haha, haha
Keep doin' it
Do it again
What?
The laugh
Oh, haha, haha!
I like that
Haha, haha, haha, haha
Hehehe
You don't think they're gonna think we're really crazy, right?



[Intro: Eminem]
(Remix!)
A crafty little bastard that I am, sly
Would've put the slick sick son of a bitch
Silly little rabbit, don't you know Trix are for kids?
This is what the moral of the story is
(Cheah!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare

[Verse 3: Cashis]
Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor with the rounds
Spun around and hit the ground, you the new James Brown
The king of Motown saw out for a while
You not a genius, you a joke, and they all know now
I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past
I'd spray, I'd get away up with whoopin' yo ass
From now on, don't speak up, name me your raps
Before I hop out your bushes, dressed in all black
I thought I told you, Cashis can suck you clean
Squeeze life out the beat, all you hear is me (Mwah!)
I'm a BBG, plus BGD
Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me
Stay alive little guy, you don't want it with me
And man, 50 put that money on me
King Mathers made me to blow up
Re-Up bout to crush, now you know Cashis! (Shady!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Hey, we ain’t really gotta keep going through this
If anybody wanna rap circles 'round you, my nigga, we 'bout to do it
You about that bitch, dough, and that swag, that’s it
Let me talk about us, we about that bitch, dough and that swag
We about that sitting on that ave
And because we sitting on that ave
We about that pistol in that bag
We about that fist fight, only after we grab a fist full of that cash
We about that get right, what you have perceived the least but not last
We are the sickest scribbling with that pen, that pencil and that pad
And y'all talking this and that, so what
My clique can wrap my dough up
Now picture that, I write the sloppiest verses down you seen
I hand it in for green
So I can buy all of my bitches bags with the stacks
And call the cash chicken scratch
Slaughter baby we just getting warm
Y'all ain't fucking nothing we can't fuck
Y'all ain't driving nothing we can't drive
If we can't afford it we just take yours
See ya'll little niggas just misinformed
Shady blew up, took the game, turn around
And ten years later he gave it to the

[Hook x2: Eminem]
Juggernauts of this rap shit (7x)
Like it or not

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Some of you niggas is bitches too, you rocking panties, huh
Sit down when you pissing too, you niggas trannies, huh
What you stand for is beneath me, you understand me, huh
Niggas get X'd like the professor and juggernauts running our family, huh
Homie I was making checks before that Martin Margiela
And niggas was rocking Avirex, now hot rappers date my ex-s
And I'm still rated X, stick my dick so far in a bitch's throat
It'll come out the other side and turn a blowjob into anal sex
Ain’t no next, cause I got now until I decide to to bow, avow your style
It ain’t gonna mean a thang cause I came to bring the pain like Tical
Nigga, now, we're the juggernauts to this rap shit
Bust a shot with ya ratchet
When suckas dropping that whack shit

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Ask them hood niggas if I hug the block
Ask these broads if I slide on that glove and uppercut that box
Man I come from the roughest so if I come up in the spot
And you bugging I’m tellin you suckas watch, I’m a take off that fucking watch
And scratch a, bitch, I'll be on a nigga ear, scream Juggernaut
He hot, that don’t mean that he nice, y'all get that confused a lot
2Pac, I don’t sacrifice what I write for the newest drop
Big Pop, us big boys still clean down to the socks
Then sprinkle a little Big L on top
I’m what the fuck you got, put Porter rock
With a pen and Eminem as a friend I’m touching this Entenmanns
That’s cake, you little boys don’t get it so listen let’s make amends
We don’t wanna be bullies, y’all wanna get beat up
So lift your knees up and start running
Or put your knees down on the ground and bow cause we the

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Look, it's House Gang on that shady street
Chill, y'all already know the address
Where the eulogy's said, so they assuming he's dead
Before that body hit that bag yet
Be face to face with them slugs
Sad cause my goons ain’t load that mag yet
In the bottom of the ocean floating
They hoping they gon find your ass with that drag net (nah)
(Blat, blat, blat) You're listening to a juggernaut
She just gon' sit by the pool 'til one nigga decide if I’m ready to fuck or not
Rap is contingent on everything other than rap, so no we ain’t discussed a lot
It's sad when they wasting your passion
Not do it for cash when they tell me they up the pot
Nigga you would too, if you knew, what this game would do to you
Been in this since 2002, look at all the bullshit I've been through
So-called beef with nobody's, I mention them and they nobody's
They say they killers, got no bodies, I’m sober talkin on no molly's
It’s Joe probably won’t throw not one bottle in the club
Honestly, it's worthless killing the purpose of these hollows in these gloves
And really I’m having a much better time on the couch with these models on my nuts
The minute we raid is the minute you’ll see us show these cock-a-roaches love (waddup)

[Outro: Joe Budden]
What on Earth will the Fuck Boys do next?
That’s right
Same shit they been doing
Getting fucked

Choppa on me give yo ass a plate
Ion give a fuck I might just fuck yo bitch today
Young nigga and I'm feelin rich today
Scratch him off lil lotto no quick pick today
Burn a nigga like Jamaicans and incents today
Been the realest nigga since an infant ok
On these Eminem beats, ima beast
From the west to the east, Ima freak in the sheets
Gotcho bitch and she got a real badass physique
Ima fuck her one time, while you beatin' yo meat
Haha

[Verse 5]
Spazzin' on this Westwood shit tho
Uh
Nicotine is cancerous, kinda like my flow
My gun is a thottie, kinda like yo hoe
Pull up on the scene, choppa on me whoa
I get more head than some fuckin' frontal lobe
Gotta let you know she gon' dance - Gigolo
Ima nigga - Jigaboo
With some money, with some dough
Ballin' on these hoes like a mothafuckin' pro
Run up on me, choppa on me and it's down to blow
Spazzin' on there ass like every track that Westwood put on
Look at all my nigga how I'm finna put on
RIP to all my niggas that is gone
Promise you that Ima let your name live on
Tatted on my face? Nah
Tatted on my neck? Yeah
Tatted on my chest? Nah
Tatted on my wrist? Yeah
Triple nine like wrist slit
I could fuck a rich bitch, I feel like a rich bitch
Prolly cause I'm rich bitch
I feel like I'm Rick James
Run up on me choppa hit yo ass like "OK"
Black bullets hit your fuckin' body like Luke Cage (huh)
Its a mothafuckin' outrage nigga
These niggas make me mad thinking they can compete
I swear to god, they flow ain't nothin to me
But Juice Wrld 999, he's something to see
It's so hard when he rap, that its make believe
"He can't be freestyle and shit forreal, he be writing it"
Nah this off the dome, I do it to be excitin'
I feel like a Buda or somethin', my flow is enlightening
But I'm not with that folly shit
Pop it like an ollie bitch
I was off the molly in a party with a bitch that's acting faker than a Barbie, kid
Run up you get grilled just like a Que, ain't talking barbe, kid
I'm the type to top - oou
Hold on watch this
Choppa on my side it's bout the size of a hockey
Shit, I shoot it in yo brain and see your thoughts - psychologist
I be Goin' harder than the hardest
Put my arm up in the rim, I feel like Vince, I feel like Carter
I been ballin' like a starter
Put my dick inside your daughter
Matter of fact bitch, I'm your father
Niggas think that they in it, but I'm tellin' them why bother
Make him disappear like Potter
I swear to god I was whippin' all this crack up in this pot
I'm making music for the problems
Yeah, I'm making music for the problems
I'm known to, make hits, take bitches and take pills
I make thrills, chase thrills and make mills
I eat meals and chill out with my bro
Chris Mills we pop willy like Meek Mills
I'm in the cut getting head from a bitch
After that she could be dead, I wouldn't give a fuck
She get on her knees and it's ironic, that she get on her knees so Juice Wrld can live it up
That bitch said that she ready to give it up
I said pull your panties down baby, the jig is up
I seen bunch of crack pipes and cigarettes
I ain't wanna fuck her, no way, surf to her mother bruh (huh)
That's word to your mom
If you looking for me I'm probably puttin' dick in ya mom
If you looking for me I'm probably putting shit in ya mom
If you looking for me I'm probably tryna sniff with ya mom
I feel like the bomb - Osam'
You ain't on shit nigga really dot com
You don't really know this shit that I'm on
You don't really know this spliff i'm gone

[Verse 6]
Hi kids, do you like?
Look
Hi kids, do you like oxy?
Do you wanna get them poppin' like molly?

Imma box 'em out left right i feel like ollie
Imma play your bitch like her first name, Atari

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, a-get yo' hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er-

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)

But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Outro: Eminem]
(Shit, fuck everybody)
Outsiderz, Pacewon, Young Zee (Fuck the entire world)
D.U

[Intro]
Whoa, uh, get your blunts in the air, and get to smoking it
And uh, passing it around and shit, 'cause this is Gilla House
Big ups to them Detroit niggas: D12, Eminem (Get high, mayne)
Royce Da 5'9", Trick Trick, and them goons
This goes out to Proof, baaabbbby

[Verse 1]
Yo, Reg Noble, roll up in the blue Volvo
I rock Polo, my face like Miguel Cotto
I'm serious, pour the cranberry with the Remy
Impersonate you rappers more than Milli Vanilli
I'm higher than the drug dealer you got your weed from
You rappers won't impress me 'til you learn to make an album
So quit it, fall back, 'cause I got the power
It's music, money, hoes, plus blunts of the sour
My name is Reggie Noble, I'm a sexaholic (Hi, Reggie)
I fucked my babysitter on my mama toilet
I'm a Kon Artist, like the homie from D12
Niggas think I ain't strapped until they hear the shells
Bitch, I'm coming out shootin' through the window, in the car chase
You gettin' shot the fuck up like Scarface
I started rolling blunts, my mind is getting open
My pen is like Cheech and Chong, I'm still smoking

[Chorus]
Yo, so when you see me in your city high as hell
And I'm dancing like Diddy — I just don't give a fuck
Smoking the sour in the drop
With the homie and he holding on the Glock sayin'
I just don't give a fuck
So if you don't follow me on the Twitter
I ain't bitter, fuck you niggas — I just don't give a fuck
When you see me on the streets, run
'Cause most likely Red got a gun — I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm poppin' the E, but I'm looking for MDMA
With a double barrel, bumpin' NWA
I hustle hard for the guap around any season
That's why my rims beaming where the parking meter reading
Beefin', you're all Vegan, you wouldn't beat a case
You're the type to snitch the first hour, First 48
Never needed a cape, I'm a lyrical hero
Doctor, the Psycho ward gave me a referral
When I form like Wu-Tang in the street with the heat of DeNiro
Redman's the coolest, Reggie Noble's a weirdo
Sativa, with your wife eating the beaver
Skeet on her lips looking like Missy Misdemeanor
The dirtiest rhymer, marijuana addict
The legend, icon, gorilla, classic
Half alien, half bro, I'm the type of asshole
To cut your girl's fake breast with a knife as big as Rambo's

[Chorus]
So when you see me in your city high as hell
And I'm dancing like Diddy — I just don't give a fuck
Smoking the sour in the drop
With the homie and he holding on the Glock sayin'
I just don't give a fuck
So if you don't follow me on the Twitter
I ain't bitter, fuck you niggas — I just don't give a fuck
When you see me on the streets, run
'Cause most likely Red got a gun — I just don't give a fuck

[Outro]
This goes out to them Brick City niggas
Everybody that's smoking that sour diesel
Put one in the air if you're smoking
Gilla House is in the building
California, ATL, New York — we all over this bitch
Detroit, you already know the bidness, let's go



[Instrumental]

Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open

[Intro]
Yeah, Blocc Boy on the beat
It's Cashis, spend some real shit
It's for my, it's for my seeds, nigga
It's still Shady though

[Verse 1]
Sit back right, all night spot post
Do the same thang, killing off black folks
Selling on the side, string save a mean more
To anything I own, watch crack being smoke
Got the picture of the seven little reasons
That keep, any nigga disrespecting me breathing
Still I be high, every time I see them
My babies, my angels and they are my freedom
I know I'm on the grind, lately I ain't coming home
They keep you in my life, I never leave your mom alone
You know I'm whyling out, straying strapped, ride or dying
You hear the stories 'bout your daddy floating 'round town?
But you call me up like, "Daddy I been finding out
That you caught Rico slipping, beat him up and stomped him out"
So when you go to school, you wanna do it too?
You just like me, how can I be mad at you?

[Hook]
You ain't had to live like I did and still you are just like me
Hell I even did a bid and came back to see you are just like me
The only reason I ain't kill myself is for fear you'll be just like be
You got the demons that's within myself, now I see, you are just like me

[Verse 2]
Standin on the block, tryna make my money clock
Servin situations, my nuts about a cock
I wanna stop but, y'all gotta have a lot
Even if it means sacrificing the life of your pops
I'm the breadwinner, I don't fear nann nigga
I don't trust nobody, I'm a man
Liquor, running through my veins, you running through my brain
I start to see your heart, we feel each other's pain
I talk to all of y'all when I say I love you mayne
One day we'll ball and I'll never have to leave again
Until that day comes, shorty be a G
I ride with y'all everywhere cause y'all are part of me
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my little niggas
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my little niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look how they talking shit, twice a year I drop a key
I bet nobody ever love 'em like they daddy did
I teach 'em young, don't be rolling on no scary shit
Long as you love each other, you'll be very rich
Everybody question how I be affording this
I make my money off of dicks and spend it on my kids
I'm sending messages in bottles of imagination
So they can feel my presence, though they at home just waiting
My soldiers still in training, throwing up forks like they banging
Know how to bogart, and never trust a stranger
They the ones I look to whenever I'm in danger
We walking holding hands, interlocking trigger fingers
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
And a father so my conversation must remain gangsta
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
And a father so my conversation must remain gangsta

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, it don't get much realer than that, Shady, Cashis, nigga
Be a man, take care of yours that don't make you no less gangsta
My nigga not take care of his, I take care of mine homie
I'mma give a individual shoutout to 'em, Miana, Jasmine, Ramani
Rashanti, Lil' Mone and Rah Monique, Tavian, they are just like me



[Intro: Eminem]
Daddy?

[Hook: Kids] (4X)
I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, yes I do

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
You don't wanna be just like your daddy
Pimpin' hoes out here drivin' Caddies
Runnin' 'round town, fuckin' with skeezers
Shots in your ass, catchin' diseases
Son, your daddy got a foul mouth
From fuckin' bitches in they foul mouths
I can't help it, my group's D12
All we do is pop pills and stay in jail
Talkin' nasty shit, Bizarre won't stop
I'll fuck two twins, with a midget on top
A sick mind, rapin' an old lady
Knowin' damn well Bizarre shouldn't have a baby
All I can teach you, learn how to mac
Smoke crack, smack a bitch when she talk back
Matter fact, smack your sister, she's a slut
Don't you realize Bizarre don't give a fuck

[Hook] (4X)

[Verse 2]
Don't go to school, become a Catholic priest
Sell crack to your Auntie Denise
If Auntie Denise is short forty cent
Make her get on the ground and {suck} some more {dick}
Nas is gon' probably hate me
When Mos Def hear this he probably gon' suffocate me
Why they let Bizarre rap on Hi-Tek track?
All he gon' do is talk about hoes and smoking crack
If your wife is pregnant I call her a whore
Leave her no money and go out on tour
Nah, I'm playing leave her something
I pack a hot dog and a fucking dirty muffin
You're my son, I'm trying to teach you somethin'
You're {eight} years old? It's time to start fuckin'
You know daddy won't give you the wrong advice
Smoke weed and listen to Obie Trice

[Hook] (8X)

[Outro]
All I can tell you how to do is pop pills and stay high
And tell a bitch to suck a dick
I'm a parent, yeah
A motherfuckin' role model
Hi-Tek



[Intro: Eminem]
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
Down okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop… pajama time

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know; who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot," it's okay
(*fart*) Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Bridge 1: Eminem]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (ah ah) beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm…

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Bridge 2: Eminem]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy, we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality; look, it's B. Rabbit!
"Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!"
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba Teletubby
Fellas! (what?) Fellas! (what?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt-squeezin', it's the season
Just go (ah ah ah ah); it's so appeasin'

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Outro: Eminem]
Touch my body
Touch my body
Oh boy, touch my body
I mean girl, touch my body



[Verse]

[Eminem]
Are we supposed to shut up or talk...I'll cut your butt up and walk
Around with my ass showing all over the fuckin town

[Proof]
....Then you get done up in chalk
Yo

[Eminem]
We ready...we ready .. we ready.. we ready ?
Ready to hold it steady....Speakin of hold it steady
You can hold my nuts steady and then
I can stick my dick in you like a machette...If you're a girl
If you're a girl then you're my world...And I will kill anybody
That means... you, her or him
It doesnt matter cause I'm Eminem
And I'm Slim...I'm also slim and your future's Whim

[Proof]
Ha ha....don't stop
D-12 y'all...yea we bust it off the top
We get in that ass Preparation-H style
Knock more boots than that group H-Town (Booo!)
Everybody tryina tell us to wait now
You look dumb as fuck...Like Puffy in his video on that breakdown (hahaha)
Tryin to dance around
How the fuck it feel lock in hand set now
Sever your style .. Divide and Parish
Part ish...when my cart is bustin thru this
Wassup to Bizarre Kid
Targets get hit and liftoff
Here it is we bout to rip off
Lick shots...no time...we gettin dick snot
Emzy

[Eminem]
Speakin of lift off
I'm blastin off...your ass is soft...so I'm startin to jack off
Cuz I'm so horny...and your lyrics are so corny
That they bore me and I woke up too late this morning
Or too early...wait a minute there goes Shirley
The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly
Couldn't remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicates and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said “I like you”...and then he walked up and said “Let me snake bite you”
And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe
Gave him a elbow...Ayo Proof ...go

[Proof]
Yo it's the D to the 1 - 2
What you wanna get done to
Your chest plate...eradicate
Get your flesh ate...easily done..Here it is
Freestyle...no need to write shit...cuz when we write shit
Y'all like to buy shit...that why street light up when we write stuff
It's time to be the champions at this...it's D-12
1-2 True crew...Slim Shady and Big Proof
Knockin over igloos in Alaska when we blast ya
A massacre creator, one time for data
Darker than Vader...go anybody hot as the Equator
It's time to get down one time for those that dont know us
Girls wanna blow us like Monica....Lewinsky
Come against me

[Eminem]
Go and see I'm an invincible MC
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passenger side
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive-by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin' mental illness a gentle stillness
Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew ? You don't smoke brew
If you do I'll choke you and then I guarantee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too and I can stick my dick in a bitch and poke you

[Proof]
Stick it in there....rock with my cock on sky rock
Knock ya eye out the sock...(sock)
Get..(get) yeah we come to rock....(it)
So don't get in the way cuz we gon drop....(shit)
Now how you feel right now we bust yo..op....(tic)....(tock)
We lunatics with mics and we dont stop we come to rock
The dirty dozen is non-stop
To the top from tree tops to ewoks that pop Reeboks
And men with pre-ops
Yo now there is 3-Pac's
Master P....Thug Life and now it's 2pac
Get back to that one...here goes the rhyme that you dropped

[Eminem]
The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one-eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you
You can even give it a dumb try...If you're a dumb guy then come try this
But I rock the microphone with my flyness
So get off my jock..get of my cock..when I sky rock ...it in sky
Rock..shit...bitch

[Proof]
Ayo...a lot of people always try to tell us...that we gonna be better or failures
But me or Slim yo you can't tell me
You try to freestyle son we gon' put these verses on your LP
Slow down with that old stuff....I heard the most of y'all is Mos Def

[Eminem]
My LP...my whole LP...tha last one was screaming help me
You couldn't melt me if you was Vanilla Ice...Yo guess what
My Nuuuuuuuuutz!!
Here I go with the lyrical miracle...spiritual spirital...you dont wanna hear it though
I rickety rock the microphone
Don't do it dont do it cuz that shit is stupid...I knew it
I take a beat and loop it...I take a beat and troop it
What the fuck did that mean...I dont know but I got phat jeans on
And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at

[Proof]
Yo wheres the beds at so we can relax and catch Ease
Y'all dont want none of tha dirty Deez
From the 3-1 its for the three of thirds
One third MC yo we smoke y'all like herbs
Under the curb early morn take it to born
Y'all get broke up...put back together ...re-enactment
Some times you see this...you just a faggot
No need to tag it...wit more loot that Jimmy Swagart

[Eminem]
Faggot....uh oh...was that homophobic...?
But no one knows it...and I'm so homophobic
I won't even throw clothes in the closet
Fuck it...I've lost it....I'm holocausted...see my face it's written all
Acrossed it
This beer makes me wanna disappear this year
I'm so high I'm 'bout to die...and I'm so tired I'm 'bout to fry
You're so fired you're down

[Proof]
Hey....it's me...it's the hamster man
Coming all the way from Amsterdam
And I come to tell you all a little secret
So you can ........eat it ....you got to grab your crackers
{mumbling}

[Eminem]
Quit spittin your writ shit bitch I'll kill you and kick you
In your motherfuckin' dick and your clit...you little pussy
Hermaphrodite with no appetite
And you ain't rappin' right but you was taking rapid bites
Of my dick when you was on it...my brain is haunted
I walk up in a place in a T-shirt wit my stains on it
But I dont give a damn...give a fuck...give a shit...give a hell
Give a piss give a dick give a lick

[Proof]
Yea....live and direct it's us
You better back up

[Eminem]
You better back up before I jack off
Back off before I jack off

[Proof]
You better back off before he jack off (laughing)
You better back off before I jack off

[Eminem]
Colder than Jack Frost...smack you across your face
While I'm still jackin off
Sittin' in the closet beatin' my shit
Ain't got nuttin' else to do cuz I'm thinkin' of a bitch
Wait a minute ...oh shit she's here
Look who walked in the door....come in it's Britney Spears!!!!
(Ken Kaniff)
Oh....come here little girl
Come here little girl

[Eminem]
What happened? (I dunno)
We stopped rappin' (Oh it's clappin')
Gun clappin' ...and all I need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
When I come off with the drum off
Whatever the hell that meant...but I can still speak wit' a accent
A French accent
Excuse my French but
Suck my dick touche le le poo...uhh....bitch

[Proof]
Bonjour...I'm here with the cure...Oh yea lets rock it for the drawer
Hey Em...how you doin this is me...The Em jock...get off my
Damn cock

[Eminem]
Yo while you're spraying verbs...you ain't even fuckin' saying words
(THuuuG) Pronounce your words right...and you can ride around curbs
And bounce your herbs tight
What the fuck ? (Yo somethin' is in the beat that keeps talkin')
Yo put another beat on before you get peed on

[Proof]
Yo are we done or what? They want us to freestyle for 45 min—

[Eminem]
Hi...Hi.... My name is ...my name is...my name is
Slim Shady...Slim Shady...Bitch you're little just like that Kim lady
And I'm in sky rock radio...the shadiest bro on the radio
But you dont hear me though



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch – it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 2]
See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
‘Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear  (Mama!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free — whee! (woosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your dada will always be there for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you — I love you, baby



[Intro]
(Fack) Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)
Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Bridge]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keepin' it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flippin' off the police while I'm leapin' a wall
Take some Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got ya little son, you'll be receivin' a call
You lucky this little punks still breathin' at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink ya teeth in ya jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is givin' you a reason to stall
I'm cockin' this deuce deuce and I'm squeezin' it off
At the first burp, fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasin' a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
I'm shittin' on rappers, (Where's Shady?) he's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw



[Ad Lib: Bizarre]
Yeah
Detroit motherfucker
DJ Green Lantern (the evil genius)
D12
We ain't going nowhere
We still smoking crack nigga!
Ha ha
Let them know
HA-HA

[Hook: Eminem]
Bitch, keep talking
Keep on popping off, with them jaws because, we ain't stopping
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking
Keep on popping that shit you're popping
'Cause we ain't stopping, 'cause you ain't stopping us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Yo, (Kuniva!) the derelict's back
I'm blazing niggas while they up in the Sheraton last
I even sold my therapist crack
You niggas is bitch, straight up, I'm bearing the facts
I love pussy wit' all my heart but I'm married to gats
And nigga I'm top pedigree so don't play wit' me
I'll blow your tattoos all over your baby seat
Kids and all been hit
Peers and all Mossberg will take your back, liver ribs and all
Kuniva the street talker, heat sparker the beef starter
Packing guns when I'm sleep walking
(Bitch, keep talking)
Throwing fire bombs down your chimney
While you eating at Wendy's
I'm in your bushes cocking the semi
Nice with the hands
Never bow down to another man
I was popping guns while you was still popping some rubber bands
Smother your clan
Sever your hands and your legs
Mail your brother your heart and send your mother your head

[Verse 2: Swift]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type of brother that will fuck your mother
With a fishnet rubber
A belligerent and rowdy motherfucker
That'll dump your body and still fly away to Maui on Atella
When it comes to beefing, it ain't no explaining
I'll change your language with a stainless
I'm contained with an anguish to leave you famous
I'm a deranged pit, I lift an AK and paint your face with
Niggas don't say shit, fuck your hype man
If it's a bystander standing by, I'm fire in at your, 'cause I can
You get squashed like pop cans
I be shooting 7 up in your mouth, man
I'm about to sell your mama bud and lace it
So when she fire it up she's coughing blood
I love to see 'em wasted
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in this rage and your legs will be replaced

[Hook: Eminem]
Bitch, keep talking
Keep on popping off, with them jaws because, we ain't stopping
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking
Keep on popping that shit you're popping
'Cause we ain't stopping, 'cause you ain't stopping us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
(Bizzy, come on!)
I ain't here to talk about Benzino or Ja Rule
I'm here to talk about little Ray Ray and what I'ma do
Psyche, I ain't gonna mention it, he'd probably sue
Next week, this shit'll be out on DJ Clue (Exclusive)
The first time I had sex... a dirty mattress
No condom... my grandmother... bent over backwards
Bizarre been fucking raw all summer
Lets make a trade, my wife for your brother
Psyche, I'm not bisexual
I'm an intellectual, transsexual, one testicle (one nut!)
And I ain't saying shit just 'cause it rhyme
I got colon cancer, I'm dying

[Verse 4: Proof]
YAY! YAY!
Rest in peace Jam Master Jay, 2Pac and Notorious BIG
I'm probably the best
God in the flesh
Blow your heart out your chest
And your chest out your vest
Leave your body a mess streets bloody as hell
Study my trail I cut him he fail
A druggy on bail nutty as well
Which such like Buddy Revel
Dead or in jail
Still heading for hell
The ghetto rebels the wrong guy
Hit your lungs, heart
Leave you full of holes like SpongeBob
We can set this from your front door to your CEO office
Got the key to your coffin (So bitch keep talkin')
Greet me wit' offers we taken over
Or get China white mixed wit' baking soda
Your hear me
GET IT CRACKED!

[Outro: Eminem]
Fucking crack heads
And this is just mix tape shit you fucking morons
This ain't brains over brawns
This is bullies over fucking pussies
Ha ha, come on

[Hook: Eminem]
Bitch, keep talking
Keep on popping off, with them jaws because, we ain't stopping
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking
Keep on popping that shit you're popping
'Cause we ain't stopping, 'cause you ain't stopping us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all
So all y'all can lick the balls and keep walking

[Intro: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
"I’ve always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin' obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits."
I need you to spit that lyrical miracle… in the swimming pool

[Verse 1]
Before this kicks off, let me set my balls in this tees
’Cause I'm dottin' i's every time I cross one of these
There's not a redeeming quality at all in me
It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream
Positive clean thoughts intervene
But they're all either altered and mean
Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
Squashed in between a brainwashing machine
Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical
Suicide bomber that’s seeing
Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening
And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving
Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region
I’m not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons
But bring your dogs, I'ma muzzle ’em
I'm not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch rock a hijab
And at least a extra large in a T-shirt
Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista
I go Hamas on the beats to a paradox on the beach
And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list
Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich
Professional shit sprayer
Bitch watch who you talkin’ to, like Apple wristwear
Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce
Prey's decreasing, I face extinction like disc players
Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett
And just stared 'til I made her think it
Said, "Maybe we should just get married."
She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square
Tell her, "Turn around," spread her legs for me, then I hit bare
Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair
As I rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear
Spray Febreze in the chick's hair
Make her wheeze tryna get air
I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared
And chained to me, and throw away the key
And she'll be so afraid to leave
That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there
Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up
It's impossible like rapin' a slut
We stay butt-naked and fuck
You're close, wait for you, what?
My idea, you comin' too, is waking you up
With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup
That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup
Hate to get bogged down in details
But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females
My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler
I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular
Shape but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut
And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck
Or helps you rake in the ducats, I want payment in pub
'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club
But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut

[Verse 2]
Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it
Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it
Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it
Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it
Tryna commit suicide and it, took five minutes
And I survived the shit
Someone's gonna challenge me, who?
Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too
You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality
You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale
Only time I start a movement's a bowel
I can't even give a "yeah" or a "woo" when you rap in the booth
Not even a "nah" or a "boo"
'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew
When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too
'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do
But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you

[Verse 3]
Creature from the Black Lagoon
I reach up and I smack the moon
You're grief struck that I'm back so soon
Your teacher for this afternoon
Creep up with a pack of hoodlums
We pack a punch like Caprisun
Heat tucked like we each snuck in a sub-machine gun
We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms
Cup of lean up in the padded room
Justin Bieber in a Catholic school
Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him
Don't adjust your speaker
I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo
Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes
Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon
While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop
'Cause her double G-cups are massive, huge!
It's fun for me just to grab a boob
Plus my penis got an attitude
My fuckin' wiener's in a combative mood
Come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you
I speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do
'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true

[Verse 4]
I just sprung a leak suddenly
What I think in my gut instinct become in sync
My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other
Ink touches the pad, then boom!
Since the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite
That's basically what makes me me
Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink
Who's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink
ADD, and better put out an APB
'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street
For you to see Shady beat
And I'll bet ya they'd need cleats
'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat
I pray please Jesus to make me decent
Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline
I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing
I stay free of divas and ladies screamin'
'Cause they keep schemin' on me
Vading keepin' the women at bay
Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses
Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen
It's straight demon—and wait!
Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers
Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat
Emcees take seats like AMC theaters
Deranged ringleader, depraved king
Who mainstream media hates
Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny
Villainous smooth criminal, livin' room
With the nude Reese Witherspoon
Who was bruised, beat with a broom
It's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it
Pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it
R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it
It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces
The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
'Cause my brain releases 'em

[Verse 5]
Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously
As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves
Just to fill 'em's a huge feat
A hill and it's too steep
Obey these demons, we're still in cahoots
Keep feedin' me blank sheets
As soon as I sink these teeth
And I'm killin' the loose leaf
Time to shake these trees again
Wait, make that phrase repeat again
Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em

[Verse 6]
Vicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them
The whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons
And I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks
On the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance
Who I influence I give two shits
If they wanna license my music to entice with
Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment

[Verse 7]
Excuse me while I stare into space for a few
In a daze or haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon
Mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view
But you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel
No one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude
Beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it
And this has little to do with bein' gay, boy
It's just where the wordplay's goin'
But ain't much I can say or do
'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored}
You say I'm always screw-faced
So if I look your way, you're screwed
'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate war too
'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you

[Verse 8]
Let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants
To the Nike, Jordan, hats
The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees
Lightning storms might be formed fast
Such a frightening forecast
But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp
From the cyphering or-gasp, but still reciting your raps
While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past
'Cause your heiny's sore, that's
'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass
From the night before last
No good, but rap somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at
Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat
Where your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact
They're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?
So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sewed 'em back

[Verse 9]
Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap
For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back
So difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it
So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class
The bear you don't wanna poke is back
The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks
When I appear, my peers stop
Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop
Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
Fear at the mere thought
Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top
I'm in the sky when I talk
Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop

[Outro]
Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you
I got a idea for a line



[Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if it's a terrible crime, it's alright
Cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong to the church of your name, Sing a song
'Cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
In my bed I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know, just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
Oh, lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In your dream, you're drownin', I just waltz in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwash and persuade you
Gibraltar, your faith'll never falter or waver
One you call to in danger, I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
'Til the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed a First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped with our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You'd catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me
I never doubt that
That's 'cause you

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you
[Gunshot]



Intro:
Nigga, Nigga you can't do that nigga you are wrong

Hook:
These motherfuckers wanna kill me!
Probably cause I'm fly as fuck
Only nigga in the club be high like what
They wanna kill me! Probably cause his characters tight
I'm the rapper that they make sure they bitch don't like
They wanna kill me! See they jealous of sale
Cause I'm talented, with his arrogant self
They wanna kill me! Bust him in the hood like whoa
They don't understand I feel like going nuts
Kill me!

1st Verse:
Homeboy you's a fag, you got your momma's traits, you gossip like a bitch
Hate a nigga cause your mans getting rich, I'm from the slums dumb son of a bitch
Sold crack like nino, yep I got a ego, but since they wasn't present them boys don't believe you
This ain't [?], this realistically, OT's history's in the streets
That's why there chemistry between Eminem and me
Cause he recognize the same OG
Ain't nothin change but change, a nigga's nuts still hang the same, since he was a young mane
A nigga slang till the sun came, till the funds gained up enough to put em in the Range
Now these niggas act strange, they wanna blow out Obie Trice's brains

Hook

2nd Verse:
I ain't mad at ya dog, to get money on the streets I get it from billboards
Homie if you subtract the voice, you'd still be giving invoices to fiends for selling them boy
You see Obie is the truth, thank God I'm in this roof, left the same night, Bullets by his brain right?
A couple more inches could have been a night night, but the almighty wasn't ready for O Trice
I'm still here like day and night, you thought I was deceased saw my way to them bright lights
I still manage, nigga my heads damaged, that ain't stop O from getting cabbage faggots (Kill Me!!)
These niggas wanna see me dead, cause the intelligence that flows through my head
Wanna be a sharp shooter better be a fed, cause I ain't going no fuckin where

Hook

3rd Verse:
I'm on my grizzly nigga
O Trice make history nigga
I'm from the hood I pop that trigger
Shady Records till I'm six feet deeper
Put a hole in a nigga tryna creep up
Take your soul make you meet the grim reaper
You's a sleeper, non-believer
That's why you deceased up nigga

Hook



[Scarface sample]
I told you, don't fuck with me
Stupid fuck, look at you now

Yeah, ha ha, have you noticed like
When niggas go to the club, it's always
It's one knucklehead nigga always mean mugging and shit
Heh, he wanna, he wanna have contact with me
Have contact with men, all these bitches in here
Faggot ass, these for them hard head niggas man

[1st verse]
Now I don't wanna come across as a boss some type of mafia
But these are my thoughts, they awful, I won't argue with ya
But see, I got a cause a clause, that I live by
Keep the heater close because I don't want to die
You see I'm from Detroit where they dump 'em off in coffins
And often there's assorted men where bullets holes departed him
And I don't want no parts of them, crazy complications
So I keep the heater cocked up in case of confrontation
And I would just be fakin if I said I wouldn't erase him
If he blatantly, tried to take away God's creation

[Hook]
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Yeah, look at ya now, for running ya mouth, ya stretched on the ground
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Ain't no way you can stop it, on that hot shit, we can get it popping
I'll kill me a muthafucka
{I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, look at you now}(2087958)

[2nd verse]
Now I'm riding through the city in a Range with no tints
Just to show these muthafuckas yes I am a resident
I ain't stack up my pennies just to move out the city
So if you got a problem with me you should know where to get me
Niggas kills me, portraying that thug
My nigga, you's a crack baby, go smoke on some drugs
Before that hot piece of slug make you where you ain't budging
Don't even nudge him, it's over for cousin, he caught a dozen
Just for fucking with the wrong animal
Animated no more, off to hell, yes I

[Hook]
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Yeah, look at ya now, for running ya mouth, ya stretched on the ground
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Ain't no way you can stop it, on that hot shit, we can get it popping
I'll kill me a muthafucka
{I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, look at you now}(2087958)

[3rd verse]
When I'm down in ATL
Stat Quo keep my fo'fo'
So shawty know Obie for real
When I'm chilling in L.A
Dre keep my AK, so I'm like an esse
When banging that steel
When I'm out in NYC
50 hold artillery for me
Watch me shut down son and dunny
Listen, O-bizzle, hold the Tek-nizzle
Holding ya neck if you, disrespect Bizzle
Sizzle up tissue, missles will not miss you
Maybe ya momma, when that pistol uplifts you

[Hook]
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Yeah, look at ya now, for running ya mouth, ya stretched on the ground
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Ain't no way you can stop it, on that hot shit, we can get it popping
I'll kill me a muthafucka
{I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, look at you now}(2087958)
*BANG!*



[Eminem]
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them

[Evanescene] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Notorious B.I.G]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make
(I repeat)
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal



[Intro]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you



Intro:
All y'all niggas I don't give a fuck who you're runnin' with, this is thug life nigga, the new generation motherfucker, you ain't killing' ease with me..

Verse 1 Eminem:

You're looking at Attila, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill
A savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You're havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'
Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half
And then had the shit hangin' by a flap of skin
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot
You copy me, but you're not
You can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall
Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
'Till the shingles come off the roof we'll shout at the ceiling
Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot
A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart
The frauds from the cream of the crop
(Wait a minute) Hold up like a flashcard
Damn dawg, is that copyin' or payin' homage?
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re-hatch on you
Come back as a black wasp, half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it
Smash it and stand on it, dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's a manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song
And can't hold a candle but even Daniel-san whacks off
You jack-offs need to come to grips like a hand job
The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number twos
'Cause that's all I dos with 'em, poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin' a deuce
And when I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em
Bitch, shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon
Then I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb
Then I'm flushin' you!

Verse 2 Busta Rhymes:

Busta Rhymes, word mother y'all, check it out y'all
Just swing to the left, swing to the right
Make ya feel good, feel alright
One time, feel good yeah y'all
Busta Rhymes in the place y'all
Makin' you feel real good y'all
Flipmode is the Squad in the place y'all

Buckwild to all of my niggas who don’t care
Floss like a bunch of young black millionaires
Makin ya run, me and my Dunn, stackin my ones
Floss a lil', invest up in a mutual fund
Blowin the horn, a sense of every day I was born
Never dream I see a nigga landscaping my lawn
Dangerous, my nigga shit be accurate
Have to get, the flow be so immaculate
Ayo, ayo, watchin' my dough, sippin' my Moe'
Slippin in slow, them pretty bitches sayin hello
Anyway go ‘head and diss, play your Oil of Olay
Little honeydip within a little Cariola
I don’t mean to hold you up but I got somethin' to say
Swear to only give you hot shit everyday
Afraid of us, you know this ain’t no game to us
You strange to us, that’s when we gettin' dangerous, come on

This, is, serious
We could make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
'Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My Flipmode Squad is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

Hold your breath, we swingin it from right to left
Word to Wyclef, nigga shit be hot to death
Stayin Alive, you know only the stronger survive
Holdin my heat, under my seat, whippin my five
Bassline for all of my people movin around
Give me a pound, all of my niggas holdin it down
Cuttin you up, the new shit, ruckin you up
Fuckin you up, my black hole, suckin you up
Back in the days, a nigga used to be ass out
Now a nigga holdin' several money market accounts
Blaze the street, and then I would just like to announce
Feelin' my groove, my jigga jigga makin' you bounce
Others is fair, me and my niggas breakin the bread
Straight gettin it, we got you niggas holdin your head
Afraid of us, you know this ain’t no game to us
You strange to us, that’s when we gettin' dangerous, come on

This, is, serious
We could make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
Cause too much of us is dangerous
We so dangerous, we so dangerous
My Flipmode Squad is dangerous
We so dangerous, we so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

Verse 3 DMX:
Don't making an ease with me, fuck nigga, young motherfucking thugs, this how with do it, don't make it an ease nigga
Six number one albums, imagine that
Cats is sick, cause dog got his swagger back
If that shit go, nah I ain't havin' that
But they don't want it, I'mma still grab the bat
Shit ain't the same, cats done changed the game
Fuck it, all y'all niggas is lame, what's my motherfuckin' name?
(Come on) Twenty million records sold
While y'all niggas is strugglin' to go gold!
Come on papi! Can't none of y'all niggas stop me
Yahmean? Y'all niggas is sloppy
What would the game be without me? Nada!
Cats talkin' about a whole lotta, Prada
Gucci and scota, Louie Vuitton
Come on, what up with what's really goin' on?
"What's hood?" You don't wanna fight yo, I get's my strap on
Put niggas' lights out {*clapping noise*} clap on!

Verse 4 2Pac:

We the realest
Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy killas!
First off, fuck yo' bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. is some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (ha ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't even know why I'm on this track
Y'all niggas ain't even on my level
I'ma let my little homies ride
On you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches, feel it!

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you niggas gettin' killed
With your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, ha ha
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job?
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!
But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!
Now when I came out I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfuckin' crew!
And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!
Chino XL, fuck you too!
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!
(Take money, take money)
All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow!
Motherfucker, my .44 make sho' all y'all kids don't grow!
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life ridas
Westside 'til we die!
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers! We do our job!
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob!
Ain't nothin' but killas
And the real niggas, all you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
You niggas laugh 'cause our staff got guns under their motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is: when we drop records, they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy killas!



[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

[Verse 1]
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down, bitch—I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut—okay, Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke
And we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrin vrin vrin!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts—bitch, I'ma kill you!

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in, or I'ma kill you!

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 3]
Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80Gs a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from OJ
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me, or I'ma kill you!

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you!

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Outro]
Ha-ha-ha, I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love you

[Intro: Eminem & Kim]
Oh, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

[Verse 1: Eminem & Kim]
Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!"
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk!)
(You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a fuck?!
C'mon! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back — well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kim]
You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a [censored]-year-old little [censored]
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don'tchu? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 3: Eminem & Kim]
Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
"Oh my God, I'm crackin' up" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, "Ah! Somebody help!"
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you



[Produced by The New Royales]

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
‘Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
‘Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
‘Cause someone told me that…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
‘Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
‘Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die



[Announcer]
What up Detroit!
I'd like to welcome everybody to the
First Annual Detroit Hip-Hop Awards
Secondly, I'd like to thank you for coming out
And supporting all of our events this year
Especially the Awards show
That means a lot to us
The vision behind the Award show
Is to recognize our own
Talents, feats and accomplishments
Both locally and nationally
With the community a part of the success of people like:
Eminem, D12, Obie Trice, Slum Village, Fat Cat
Sick Notes, Fat Killers, Almighty Dreadnaps
Raw C and Silent Riot, just to touch on a few
The first award we'll be presenting tonight
Is the Hip-Hop Recognition Award
This Award is to recognize
The individual for outstanding support of Detroit Hip-Hop
When I think of that
One person stands out without a doubt
From the days of the Hip-Hop shop
To the days of multi-platinum record sales
You'll see this guy on MTV Wednesday night
Then you'll catch him at St. Andrews Hall Friday night hosting a battle
He's been around the world
And still finds time to get back to the city
That being said, it's both a pleasure and an honor
To present the first Annual Hip-Hop Recognition Award!
*Purple Pills starts playing*
To none other than my man, Big, Proof!

[Proof *While announcer is talking*]
Pssh, Damn man
My city love me, I love my city man
I feel like I'm lettin' 'em down
I done so much
But don't feel like I've accomplished, nothin' at all
Hip-Hop...
I remember when me 'n' Hiphop first fell in love man
Detroit and Hip-Hop, damn, pssh
Psh, eh. Cause I ain't changin' for shit
I'ma always be me



[Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'll start it off, yo, yo…
My name is Shady, his name is Proof
Yo, we used to have a roof up on my house
And now we had a mouse that ate the cheese out of the fridge
Didn't want to admit that I was on welfare when I was three
Plus, when I was four, my mother used to leave
She used to always slam the door and say
"Goodbye, goodbye, Marshall, I'm leaving, I'm single
And right now I'm going to mingle at bingo."
"Yeah, see you later, alligator," is what she said
And I would always stay at house, freezin' till I'm dead
'Cause it was cold inside that house, we never had no heat
Yo, Proof used to come walkin' up right up the street
And be like, "Yo, what up, Em? How you doin'?"
I used be like, "Yeah, man
It's good to see you, dawg, but my life's ruined
'Cause my mom just left," she left my brother Nate
And I hate the fact that we never had no food on our plate
So then Proof said: "What up, Em?"
Yo, so I said "Proof, won't you come in?"

[Proof]
Yeah, yeah, come in, what’s up with dat?
Tango and Cash, came to mingle and blast
Together tougher than Alcatraz prison bars
Drivin' foreign cars
Yes, it's me and my man compadre
Black and white, white and ivory and black ebony
They can't step to me, rubbery and heavenly
They can't see us in the 313 vicinity
Ayo, Em, ha ha ha ha

[Eminem]
What up? Ha, ha, I'm comin' like ha ha
I'm ill like nah nah, and y'all don't wanna see me
'Cause I'm ill with the skill
And I can grill and I always keep it real
When I built my garage back after it just got burnt down
Sorry that my parents weren't always around
But it was really hectic growin' up
But now I'm blowin' up
So it don't matter: every show I do, I'm always showin' up
To the club drunk as hell, drunk as fuck, drunk as what?
Can't say that on MTV
But remember it? Little old wimpy me
Who used to always dream to be on MTV
Now you can't see me
I know you remember that rhyme
Ayy, wait a minute, yo check it out, I'm 'bout to flatline
Pass the mic back to Proof
'Cause we get loose, we drink gin and juice
Sip it 'cause we always raise the roof

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, we all up in your sight like cataracts
Me and Em tag-team
Beat any of y'all on some battle rap
See us next time we strippin' out your Cadillac's
How you like that? Soon you down like a battle axe

[Eminem]
I'm down like a battle axe
I got a phatter axe to smash
And I smash your cataracts
'Cause it's a Cadillac's that I be drivin'
When I be high off fuckin' vivarin
Now you can't see me 'cause I'm revivin' and survivin'
In the D, every single day in Detroit
If rappers wanna step to me, they better get to the point
'Cause they don't understand the way that I do it
The fluid that I be spittin' is never written
'Cause I'm always, always bitten, 'cause it—

[Proof]
Ayo, you make your neck crack like a snare pop
We're fresh and they're not
So give it up, don't even do this
You're wack, in fact you get flat-lined
You need practice
We stick you like a cactus
Nah, you're not a guy, you're an actress
The fact is—

[Eminem]
Here's my address, this is my old address
And called… a street called Dresden
Yo, dead presidents is what I'm resurrectin'
Gotta say what's up to Desmond and JLB
But yo, they don't help me
Do a thing, they never did
When I was a clever kid, rhymin'
I always used to go to school and climb in
The back baseball diamond

[Proof]
Hey yo, abort, hold up!
Hurt shoulder
Peace for Kurt Loder
Yeah, we're doin' an interview
In a minute or two
We're gonna enter in you

[Eminem]
In the nude, when we intrude
Don't mean to be rude
But yo, what's up, dude?
How you doin', MTV?
How you doin', Kurt?
How you doin' everybody else in the world?
You gettin' hurt
By this freestyle that I be comin' up with
Eruptin' and kick your mother in the tummy
And in the stomach

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, and all of this we just done is freestyle
Ah, ah, ah, don't touch that dial, yeah

[Eminem]
Hold it right there, I'm your worst nightmare
Wipin' diapers on my high chair

[Proof]
What?! Yeah!

[Eminem]
When I was this big
Now I'm still bigger, but I'm skinny like a twig
Skinny little white boy
Growin' up I liked noise
I spike punch and light joints

[Proof]
Ayo, everybody looks for us to follow
We thrust the bottle, thrust the throttle
Bust a bottle over your head
Train your thoughts just like Cus d'Amato
Your guts is hollow
Back up, Proof and Em

[Eminem]
And all them wack MC's steppin' to me at Saint Andrews
Just remember that I hate you, and yo, I can't stand you

[Proof]
Yeah!

[Eminem]
Bye bye!
Goodbye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!

[Proof]
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!



[Ca$his]
Screech out, yeah
That's what I'm talkin 'bout {*bzzt*}
Ca$his, Shady {*bzzt*}
Good lookin Em

We in the Cadillac Cartel and Snoop DeVilles
Ridin on Treys like Barksdale, I'm movin steel
Step out and see the new Car-mellos you would steal
But you ain't runnin around here cause dude is real
You dub for fifteen minutes sayin they shoot and steal
I would tell you more, but I think, you would squeal
I'm ridin at the wheel, lean back, poppin pills
I make a lil' side money plus I got a deal
I'm nine kids deep; see, why I gotta deal?
And serve so the government, can't touch my skrill
Before I'm sittin in my big, house, on the hill
Dark, not in H.B., Hall go, have a meal
I am the bogus boy, that was in my uncle's will
You figured that out, and see that I'm a G for real
And fear man is one thing that he don't feel
Knock a nigga out, while his gun on him still

[Hook: Ca$his]
'Llac ('Llac) motion (motion) drop (drop) top (top)
West (West) coast (coast) beatin down yo' block
That's how we do it out here, out here - folk
That's how we do it out here, back forth - folk
Back on the 'Llac ('Llac) motion (motion) drop (drop) top (top)
West (West) coast (coast) beatin down yo' block
That's how we do it out here, out here - folk
That's how we do it out here, back forth - folk
Back screech out

[Ca$his]
New Makaveli jeans, five Vicks, Blue Leaf
Tall tee, hang to my motherfuckin knees nigga
I got a gang of my partners from O.C., figure
If it's some drama they all, ridin with me if ya
Recognize a situation that you can't win
You may feel like a marked mellow but you can live
Still you tryin to be hard, yellin out stupid shit
I just look at you laughin, say that you a bitch
I got somethin from class despite my truant seers
But I can whoop on yo' ass homie if you in Sears
It's better not to be brash and come with foolishness
Talkin 'bout my county 'til you see how true it is
Come to the 7-1-fo', Glizzy could get you rich
Some of the homies got dough, the rest is militant
We got goons that's loon tootin them wicked sticks
My whole set to end, Shady that's what the bid'ness is

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
We switchin lanes and candy paints on 22's
And '83s and '88s, in grammar schools
Different names of the 'Llac, I hear the hundred crews
Miss the exit, that's all from gettin blunted fool
Flick the tussin, a couple buzzards is comin through
Soon as they see me say "Ca$h, I wanna fuck wit'chu"
So many niggas is lamed out, and gullible
We make 'em lookouts in fog eyes for copper moves
I was livin the life, of sellin rocks to dudes
When I got to a block, I was unstoppable
I had to serve out the 'Llac, cause they was watchin moves
But bein poor was just, somethin I couldn't do
I wanna roll in a six-hundred and stunt on you
Next time I see you and yours, I'll pull a gun on you
Through every stage of my life, I been that fuckin dude
You should be glad I took, time to fuck wit'chu

[Hook]



[Intro: Obie Trice]
Can we re-enact Biggie's song?
Can you shit on me? I just want you to shit on me, Obie

[Hook: Eminem]
Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl)
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with
My mothafuckin' emotions
(Fucking with me could be dangerous)
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fucking for real, I'll make you suffer
(You never know what I may really be like in real life)
Like I suffered, if you fuck me, then I'll make you fall in love
(I'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)

[Verse 1: Obie]
Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
And Magnums the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a ho I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day (bitch)
I'll rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own
No, I'm in and out your home
And this in, and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around
I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex
And sell 'em around town, how that sound?
If I was in love with ya, now you wanna clown?
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown
Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nothing but what it should be

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV
So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth and if you believe
In that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
But personally that actually works for me
Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'm a bachelor, bitch, and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers
Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that god damn tavern
And having another déjà vu, we seeing security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30, [gunshot], you heard me?

[Hook: Eminem]
Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl)
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with
My mothafuckin' emotions
(Fucking with me could be dangerous)
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fucking for real, I'll make you suffer
(You never know what I may really be like in real life)
Like I suffered, if you fuck me, then I'll make you fall in love
(I'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)

[Verse 3: Obie]
See you looking at the life, you looking at the lights
You looking at the ice, you ain't looking at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I say he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type
O love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussing out Yolanda (fuck you, bitch!)
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swinging her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe!
Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth, sweety

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See what we do under the covers
Should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of Us as new lovers
But this is when a bitch get to showing her true colors
Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed
As soon as me and you've done it
And save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it
I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doing it to
Cause you never know when the shoe could end up
On the other foot and it backfires on you
Cause you may think you want it
Then you want me, til you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked
'Cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you
You'll be walking out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leaving this house in that, do you?
Not 'til I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
And have you walking out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never cause we gon' be together forever
Right, bitch? Right, bitch?

[Hook: Eminem]
Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl)
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with
My mothafuckin' emotions
(Fucking with me could be dangerous)
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fucking for real, I'll make you suffer
(You never know what I may really be like in real life)
Like I suffered, if you fuck me, then I'll make you fall in love
(I'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)



[Intro: 2Pac]
Death Row, that's where motherfuckers is endin' up

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now pull that dime out your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow. turn em into forty-niners

[Chrous]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me? 16 on Death Row

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell, is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, niggas countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em 50
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this doc
Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
You now about to witness the power of (Death Row)



[Obie Trice]
Here we go

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
You could get popped; it's a possibility up in my vicinity
Poppin off with that hostile energy
In a hospital with a doctor getting in
When adrenaline is mixed with an obnoxious temperament
Honestly I got a monster pistol gripped
And I commence to spit, none of y'all exempt from it
Spit, spit, passes from it
You get stiff from it, church man see your box plummet
And I will never let 'em give it to me
I gotta live to be one hundred and three
Gotta reach my epitome, wanna seize my enemy
And receive my penalty nigga

[Hook 2X]
LAY DOWN! (Lay down..)
I'm a man, man
I ain't runnin, I'mma stand wit my gun in my hand
I got plans and a place to BE!

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
I ain't tryna be cocky wit it, but I'm the nigga from the block that did it
Got a nine that's livid, I ain't tryna see the box in prison
Getting knocked outta my position
Now I got a pot to piss in, pissed off motherfuckers' mouth off - bitchin
Probably cause he lack ambition, so his wack decisions
Get mad at the nigga that's getting 'em
That's when he see the next nigga that's hittin him
With a vigorous pistol over this ridiculous issue
Dismiss you, in attempt to
Take me out my motherfuckin tempo nigga

[Hook 2X]
LAY DOWN! (Lay down..)
I'm a man, man
I ain't runnin, I'mma stand wit my gun in my hand
I got plans and a place to BE!

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Niggas get nauseated, a artist made it
Had it hard against odds and emancipated
To the floor I spit cause, god damn they hate it
To see the lady they dated caterin to the latest
Shadiest artist, up in my radius
Get faded with a plated revolver
Rated me R, haters get faded with horror
Erased, no fate for tomorrow
All cause he think he hard tough
Got a car cause, he was runnin at the mouth, hush
I will never let 'em give it to me
I gotta live to be one hundred and three
Gotta reach my epitome, or decease my enemy
And receive my penalty, that'll be the end of he
Tryna seize my entities, finna be the end of his identity
When I tell him to

[Hook 2X]



Yo
You know every time you come home
You got to murk somethin'
[Lil Jon]
Stop! It's the motherfucking remix!

[Intro: Mase & (Lil Jon)]
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (TS)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (fo' real)
I heard Harlem is back (You know we had to do the remix)
Who in the world want a problem with that?
(Yeah! Eminem nigga!)
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (Lil Jon nigga!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Mason Betha!)
I heard Harlem is back (Fat Joe!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Let's go!)

[Hook: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

[Verse 1: Mase]
You know it's deja vu, and the day y'all do
It'll be the day y'all bleed
Wrist minus 80 degrees
King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take 5 years off?
Cold turkey? Come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Mase call them wanna get their mase on
You hot 16, I'm a very great song
They beating on the DJ booth 'fore the Mase song
You play Clark Kent, you better have your cape on
Plenty homes Mansion many rooms
My necklace, 2Xs and three Bentley bulls
Lean back, Lean back, Lean back
Cause he's back come on
Lean back, Lean back Lean back
Cause he's back come on

[Lil Jon]
Eminem, what's up! Hey!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems with the boogie-down Bronxster
You don't want no drama with the blonde bomber
Original Don Dada of the blonde bottle
The model from White America
Then Joe, the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Mase back to re-per-e-sent
E-ver-y-thing else in between
Including the percentages of the rest we don't
The best from each coast, the midwest to the dirty-dirty
Even further to Miami, all the way back to Californ-i-a
It'd probably be best right now if I warn Dre
To get on the horn and tell 'im about the storm coming all our way
So tell a pal, grab a gal right now, get on the floor while I wait
Shake that ass a little more my way, but baby, I don't dance
Not that I can't, there's a pistol in my pants
Come on

[Hook]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back, come on
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
No Judas or cowardice or Cain's brother
Abel is able to stop me, nigga, not me!
Got the streets asking "Damn, who can top P?"
Summer Jam? Killed it, man, they did it all with one beat
I guess I'm bi-coastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out (What?!)
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear niggas thinking Crack got one hit, then he out
Nope! Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away
And run and get your Emmy's out
Lean back, motherfuckers
This here's a three peat we back at the Rucker
It's Cook Coke Crack, preach it to ya, brother
The mic more rap and preach you motherfuckers

[Hook]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

[Outro: Lil Jon]
Said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, fuck nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, bitch nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
HEY!



[Chorus: King Gordy]
Uh
We get to slicin' and stabbin’
We got no mask with axes
Leatherface
We will pull op on your avenue, slaughter your family like animals
Leatherface
We eat your body like cannibals
Run and the wolves will come after you
Leatherface
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, chop you and fuckin' kidnap you bitch
Leatherface, Leatherface, Leatherface
Leatherface, Leatherface, Leatherface
Leatherface, Leatherface, Leatherface

[Bridge: King Gordy]
We eat your body like cannibals
Run and the wolves will come after you
Leatherface
Sorry we won’t stop attacking you, chop you and fuckin' kidnap you bitch
Leatherface

[Verse: King Gordy]
I'm sicker with verses
This clip is dispersin' you into hearses
Then into the church and into the dirt
Your body will fill up with worms then
I am psychotic, erotic, bionic
High of the chronic and I don't think logic and I'm in your closet I'm hidin'
As fucking as soon you walk

[Verse: Hopsin]
Listen
It’s 11.30 p.m. and you ’bout to fall asleep and I'm at your window with a mask on (Shh! Huh?)
I proceed to climbin’ through the gatter on with a machete that I'm 'bout to shove into your backbone
Then cut it down until your asshole, I bloody up your fuckin' bathrobe (Bitch)
And if your wife is awake and she witnessin’ what I'm doin'
I kill her then I fill her pussy up with tampons
Yes I'm that gross (Yeah)
When it rains it pours
Especially when my blade is pulled
The deeds paid it for
I'm butt naked in your neighbors pool
I stay stuntin' when I'm face fuckin' a decapitated skull
You ever seen that before?
Freak nasty gore
I need asking lord
So please ask the lord
For three trashy whores with knee pads of course
Who deepthroat while my balls swing back and forth
I like it like that (Yeah)
Bitch don't you try to fight back (No)
All you now realizing I have (What?)
I can't allow the fluid I'ma jam e'rybody to your fuckin' cleavage area
And damn it I'ma



[Hook: Eminem]
Yall better leave dat boy alone
Cause if they don't, yall know he gon' come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't dare get that boy going
I said leave dat boy alone
Cause yall don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To tear some shit up when he in that zone

[Bridge 2X: Eminem]
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Cause you don't want to get that boy going

[Verse 1: Swift]
It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I ain't to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Be turning ghost 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and, I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation, I'll run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her gun to mouth resuscitation
A niggas information, they haunted and they sad
Got you mad cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing
Coming here is the worst mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle, I'm pulling you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb ho punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
That nigga's dying over pride to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play beef
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's fun that you home sick and you can't really get sleep
Cause you done laid a nigga down, but that ain't me
Well my conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vain
I'm a man, I do my business and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now people know I live trifling, I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a new knife
And I strike people so fast, niggas think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few hype men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted lou pikner
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
Cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kuniv' son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, from skinny to wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas done tried once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stomped till your eyes shut
No time for the why whats, I'm writing these five words
"Fuck you dick riding niggas," count it, it's five words

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Swifty McVay (that boy he hot to death)
Mr. Porter (that boy he hot to death)
THE Kuniva (that boy he hot to death)
Yep, better step before you get beat to death
Yall dont want to get dem there boys
Dem there boys be makin noise
Dem there boys got all kind of toys
You better step before you get destroyed
D12
Dem there boys they hot to death them boys



(Chorus: Eminem)
Yall better leave dat boy alone
Cuz if they dont
You know they goin come back on 'em
And they dont want him to come back strong
I wouldn't durr get that boy goin

I said leave dat boy alone
Cuz yall dont know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To stirr some shit up when he in that zone

(Bridge x2)
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Cuz you dont want to get that boy goin

(Verse 1: Swift)
It's my attitude that's makin me bust shit
I hate to be fucked with
So basically niggas wastin they time tryin to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returnin bows 'fore you be lookin at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
Witha mag and i'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation i run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her mouth to gun ressecitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got you mad cuz they shittin through their stomach in a bag
We comin too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancin
Comin here is the worste mistake that could ever happen
When i'm in my vehicle i'm pullin you in
I gaurantee the world will never see you again

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Kon Artist)
Honest to god i usually try to keep to my self

He's tryin to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb hoe punk
Atleast a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
This nigga dyin over prizes to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, i dont play deep
You borrow guns, i own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinkin you can't really get sleep
Cuz you laid a nigga down without any meat
Well my cops won't allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a magne i do my biddin and i do it again
If you take it to that level, i take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

Now people i live triflin i express it through writin
If you can't feel it, then i must express it through fightin
And i jus bought me a new gauge and added on a knew knife

And i love to Kunive son, and you left a live one

FUCK YOU DICK RIDIN NIGGAS count it, it's five words

[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Chorus: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Chorus: Polina]
‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me, life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, "That's right, fight's on, bitch!"
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy



[Intro]
I'm legendary, legen-legendary, I'm le-le-legendary

[Verse 1]
The theme song to my supplier, plays in the key of a ki, I'm like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire, rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light: we two of the same
God melted the Rubic's cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice, now I'm running through until I'm through with the game!
You can find me under a black cloud: I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style; it'd be Sammy Cassell's
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause it's the hammer, the cannon, you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
I'm a heavyweight; I'm catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 9/11, meditate 'til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my 'fetti straight
The MAC-11'll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the "I" in "try"?
Ryan vibes like cyanide; I am proud
To say that I've evolved, there's only one "I" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself, vibing to my Lost Sessions
I'm legendary

[Chorus]
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary

[Verse 2]
I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap, niggas can Google this gat
Cause we the reason why you eating, we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack
Just who we kidding here? This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume that I'm tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back, in fact
As far as you new kids, what have you did?
I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past, but I'm happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'Ghini I'm sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow, the blunted joint: here's the reefer
One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know, I learned a while ago, to hide power from you, I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites: I kill you every time
Throw a nigga' body around the room, have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the best-dressed lie
And why you niggas is hating?
I wonder is God really an atheist? He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent cause y'all been imitating
A statue of me, to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the hole of a volcano: I'm having a big swig

[Chorus]
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary




[Intro : Lomepal]
Lomepal, Doumam's, c'est le Loum's
Les deux princes issus du Thanxlave, TXLV
Walter, où tu t'caches frangin ?
Hey, faut qu'le jeu vois l'jour
On joue à ça presque tous les soirs
Je t'explique les règles, vas-y
On a tenté ça dans la Grünt 8, on va faire ça maintenant
Doumam's, qu'est-ce tu racontes ? Je t'explique les règles
Je t'explique les règles, frangin et c'est parti

[Couplet 1 : Lomepal]
Ça part avec le jeu du Loum's, je t'explique la petite règle
Quoi ? J'lâche quelques mesures, Doum's fait la quatrième
Et puis j'repousse ensuite, t'auras besoin d'beaucoup
D'chance pour t'enfuir, ce jeu ne date pas d'hier
OK, tu l'a dis, Mamadou, salaud
J'balance des rimes comme des coups d'marteau
Et ça fait mal au crâne, tu connais l'acrobate
C'est ce gars Lomepal, c'est paranormal

[Couplet 2 : Doum's]
Ouais, j'planterai des gueshs pour un peu plus de maille
J'suis un escroc légal tah La Française des Jeux, vrai !
Est-ce que tu captes les bails ? Doumam's, il se déplace
Dans l'obscurité, bref, ambiance ténébreuse
C'est pour mes ninjas, mes Uzumaki
Mes Coulibali, tous les petites kah
De Paname qui s'baladent, c'est pour les man
De banlieue et tout Paris, écoute as

[Couplet 3 : Lomepal]
Écoute as, pas d'armistice, j'envoie les missiles
Pas cramé, le drive-by est effectué en tricycle
C'est physique, oui, j'martyrise des victimes
Et j'mets des petites mines dans leurs iris, miskine
OK, regarde c'que Lomepal apporte, quoi ?
J'taffe mes structures, dans l'futur il faudra qu'ça cogne
Y'a plus d'amour, y'a qu'des jaloux, chaque jour
J'ai l'impression d'voir le Diable qui toque à ma porte

[Couplet 4 : Doum's]
Salut, c'est le Diable, quoi ?
J'crois qu't'a des comptes à m'rendre
Y'a pas d' "on s'arrange ", pas de négociations
Faut qu'tu payes cash, enfoiré, laisse-moi mon argent !
Wesh, les, man c'est une blague de garagiste
Vous emportez pas, j'suis pas sataniste, ouf !
Tu vois c'que j'veux dire ? Oui, oui, j’aplatis
Des tas d'rimes, c'est grave facile, sisi la famille

[Couplet 5 : Lomepal]
OK; sisi la famille, le mec dédicace, Mac Cain Family
Nique les héritages, on fly tels des Émirats
Tu vois qu'j'suis efficace, tu l'a compris
J'connais la combine, Lomepal lâche que des rimes sales

[Couplet 6 : Doum's]
Pour les maw, j'ai l'outil adéquat
J'leur cale des doigts, j'collectionne les accessoires
Les femmes, les cougis, ça rentre ! J'les baise
Dans des 4 étoiles alors que j'paye pas, je t'ai tout dit

[Couplet 7 : Lomepal]
Laisse moi t'éblouir mais reste cool, y'aura personne à ta rescousse
Où sont les vrais couz, les vrais boug ?
C'est pour mes étourdis et même si j'lâche un texte pur
Ça reste un interlude dans le projet 2FingZ

[Couplet 8 : Doum's]
Ce sont les règles du jeu
Les structures du Loum's, mec, tu peux
Le faire aussi, hey yo, c'était le D, Doumam's
Avec le L, Lomepal, poucave
C'est quoi les bails ?
T'a vu ça ? Cette sorte de truc de fou
Le gars il finit la rime en impro
Kiffe ça, négro ! 2Fingers

[Outro : Lomepal & Doum's]
Doumam's, Doumam's ! Attends, frère, j'termine le bail...
Vas-y, sors du stud, là, y'a Paris Sandwich qui vient d'arriver
Ah ! Bah, vas-y, pète moi un double cheese, frère, moi, j'termine le bail...



[Intro]
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Verse 1: Hittman]
Talking that, walking that, spittin' at hoes
Smoking this, drinking that, gettin' at hoes
Fuck this I'm hitting that I'm hitting em both
Have one riding dick, one licking my toes
When I'm loving these hoes there ain't no love involved
No hugs, no kisses, bear rugs, bare britches
Rare bitches like them hoes in them Black Tail pictures
Bitch jumped off my dick
(Is that Dre over there?)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I just took some Ecstasy
Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sat back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out

[Hook: Kurupt]
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, high
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, all my ladies
Let's get high, high
High, high
Let's get high, high
Come on let's get high

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I make the four hop
Pull up at the spot
Weed by the barrels in my G'd up apparel
Stomping in the party
Kurupt, Young Gotti
I'm fucking something in this bitch
Hit 'em with some gangsta shit
Put something in your mouth bitch real tasty
I'm looking real saucy in my gangsta-ass Stacys
Hit the party, ease up, Kurupt with an ounce an'
Got all the hoes in this motherfucker bouncing
Bouncing

[Interlude]
Yo, whattup, Scruncho?
Mel-Man. what's cracking?
Wassup wit all these ol' punk ass hoes in here?

[Verse 4: Ms. Roq]
Nigga what, I'm a hustling bitch
I like them get rich niggas
Them hit the switch niggas
Niggas bout the sex and which bitch to hit next
While I'm kicking my game and collecting them checks
Got all y'all niggas vexed to fuck this triple-X rated ho
You say you ain't eat it, you ate it though
And uh, Roq don't stop, can't be dropping no drawers
To the niggas how you figure got you shitting in yours
Yeah, little dicks always running they mouth
While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice, fuck the wife, no doubt
Trying to live lavy, marry a big dick and stay cavi
Holla back at them niggas that hollered at me
Pop the Cris'
Whip the six and shit
And have all y'all niggas limp when I twist my shit
Yeah, bitch ass niggas



[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 1]
Yeah now let me welcome you to my small town
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around
How I was raised
808 drums quaking, they shake that box, '88
And the dope boys hotter than hells gate
But I, still in the shade
With a fold out chair, with a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate
A-L-A, B-A-M-A
I’m off I might be in the lake
I might go to Talladega and see me a race
And bring me a case
Yeah I’m bringing the case
I’m getting throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 2]
And I’m all the way throwed off
Z71 take the bow off
Dipped in mossy oak with a mullet mohawk
Yeah with a bright orange hat and a bag underneath that Chevy seat
Yeah buddy, might go off
Split you like a bowling ball
Spit chew in my overalls
Yeah home of the gumbo
Got a couple folks that’d do it to you for the hundo
And when them elephant feet rumble
That dixie cup's gonna fall off the console
You don’t wanna have a convo with not understand that Bama slanguage
Like hollering ain't it
But I come to paint it, so it won’t be throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

[Verse 3]
I’m just a Kid that Rocks
I’m just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a .22 in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta
She’s twenty-two and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all
Take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the fuck did I get a catalogue with more hits than a fucking jackhammer dog
Cause I planned it all
Crimson Tide standing tall
Shit, I’m another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I’m going off and I’m getting throwed off

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own name
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll



Detroit

There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who would drive to you, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people

Stay up Detroit




Dear Afeni

Sorry if it looks a little sloppy, I could've done a little better if I had the right pencils. Instead, I had to draw it in pen. Plus, I just kind of thought of the idea a little too late. But I've been drawing since I was 10, and I thought you might like it. Anyways, thank you for always being so kind to me. You are a true Queen, and I mean that in every sense of the word. I will never forget the opportunities you have given me. You will always be in my heart, my thoughts, and my prayers. As I have said before, you have no idea how much your son and his music has inspired, not only the "Hip Hop" world, but, speaking for myself, has inspired my whole career. He was, and still is, the true definition of a "Soldier." When I was feeling at my worst; (before fame, before Dre) I knew I could put that "2Pac" tape in, and suddenly, things weren't so bad. He gave me the courage to stand up and say "F**k the world!" "This is who I am! And if you don't like it, go f**k yourself!" Thank you for giving us his spirit, and yours! God Bless you!

Love

Marshall



[Intro]
Come here, Royce

[Chorus: Amerie & Royce Da 5'9"]
Life is a moment in space (come over here)
When the dream is gone (sit down, let me talk to you)
It's a lonelier place (right here, over here)
Uh, this is life
Life is a moment in space (sit on daddy's lap)
When the dream is gone (I want to tell you something)
It's a lonelier place

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Listen, yo
Little Royce Nickel Nine, eyes wide with sight
With a future as bright as the light in the eyes of Christ
Ready to take on the world and whatever is in it
Proofread, sign, and seal whatever you finish
I can only lead you while you're on your quest for knowledge
I'mma teach you to have sense and to respect the dollar
Hope for the best, and you'll see, your world will be solid
I'mma teach you the truth, even behind worldly logic
This is life, cut and dry, days is bright, nights is dark
Fights get sparked, it's almost like to get ahead
You got to be twice as smart, the realities of life is harsh
Just know that God's keeping you level
He'll even speak through the ghetto to reach you
Just to teach you that the streets is the devil
Everybody's design is different
Which means that we're dying by livin'
Oblivious to the time that we're given
So you don't prepare for the death, you live for the life
And live right like, do right by your kids and your wife
Have fun as a child, yo them years is precious
The future brings fear and stress as the year progresses
You gon turn a lot of them down, you gon feel rejection
You gon tell a lot of lies and you gon hear confessions
It's a two way street when you deal in his presence
Only your life can show that everything is real in this message
This is life

[Chorus: Amerie]
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
Uh, this is life
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yo, the whole world is upon you, the pressure is on
And you can probably sum your life up the best when you gone
Upon the creation of all men, destiny's born
For us to reproduce, so you can keep the legacy goin'
I know you think I'm Superman, but I got weaknesses too
I keep a firm leash on things by believing in you
And after I'm gone I live on breathing through you
And anything I had in this life, I leave it to you
Aim for the sky and fly till you come back down
I hand you the baton and you run, till you come back 'round
Let your heart tell your temper, "Put that gun back down!"
Dry your tears up and turn that frown upside-down
It'd be plenty to cry for, think life, not death
You got much more to live for than to die for
But you got to stay humble
Cause just as hard as your work to get it
There's people working harder to take it from you
Cause life, something that people take for granted
As time passes, you gon want something back
But you won't get it cause history's made every second
So you crave every lesson and save every blessin'
No matter how you view the world yo, you never will get it
The world'll be the world through the eyes of whoever is in it
But things ain't gon always go right
Look at it like, yo this ain't your day, but this your life, and live
Life

[Chorus: Amerie]
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
Uh, this is life
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

[Amerie]
There will be trials and tribulations
But don't let them, don't let them, don't let them bring you down
I said you better keep going to your destination
After your darkest hour the sun will come around

[Royce talking]
This is life
Yo I don't care, I don't care if this song don't sell one copy
That's not even what it's for
It's for you, my boy
This is life

[Amerie singing in the background]
You gotta keep going on, you gotta keep moving on
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Cause this is life



[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck
Or get struck like lightnin’, fighters keep fightin’
Put your lighters up! Point 'em skyward, uh!
Had a dream I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game’s nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin’ feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I’ll be the fuckin’ illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I’m refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up’s usin' no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this buildin'
And pardon me if I’m a cocky prick
But you cocks are slick, poppin’ shit
On how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid?
Flip "dick," you did opposite: you stayed the same
‘Cause "cock" backwards is still "cock," you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9", but I feel like I’m 6'8"

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
By the time you hear this, I’ll prob'ly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: "Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!"
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters



I stay higher than racial tension, with a facial expression
Tensed up like I'm suffering from a case of nasal congestion
Eyes hazel, complexion beige, age still in question
Critics hate my tape, kids can't wait for the next one
As long as there's rejects, my tape never ejects the deck
That's the level of respect each CD gets
While ya'll graspin at straws like me snorting crushed Aspirin
And gasping at air and collapsing in malls
I'm just a realistic impression of artistic expression
Whose tape was in the deck when kids shot up the delicatessen
So when I launch a verse full of controverse
That'll haunt you worse than Ma$e before he joined a church (P Diddy!)
I'm sorry kids I dismissed this class
I'm going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas
Um, Mr. Mathers just missed the bathroom
Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass
This is my last album cause this is my last Valium
Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom
If ya'll don't like the shit that you're hearing
Then blow me til your lipstick is smearing
And I can see my dick disappearing

May 23rd
That means we're taking over this year, you heard? (x2)
Yo, May 23rd

[Verse 1]
Modern day gangsta, old school playa
A fine display of greatness at it's greatest
Send an array of strays at any patriot
Breaking down K's instead of quarters, it's kettle water
Please, no more zip locks or shoe boxes
My little niggas in school got shit now
All of the teachers in the school got fixed
When they seen me in the streets they give me gifts
I ain't riffing or raffing or rapping or yapping
No I ain't from the Nolia, but I'm clapping
No I ain't into coke, but I have it
No I ain't into dope, but I stock it
Like I ain't got the po in my pocket
No I don't like they clothes but I cop it
The white man looking like I ain't fit to go in my pocket
No I ain't fit to stop I'm still poppin
Holla, like I ain't at your throat
I'm a turtle neck collar
Our purpose is respect with a capital R
Whoever don't die today, they'll be back tomorrow nigga
I'm on a Harley, cruising by rides
With the stogey in my mouth, Makeveli in the iPod
Weezy F., nine milli and the eye's lied
Make you think that was a fire squad
The way I fire mine, in reality yall behind mine
So I can't see you, all you see is Evisu signs
Weezy



[Intro]
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (Yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home



[Intro]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, ‘cause—

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, ‘cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated — it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, ‘cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience ‘cause—

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers







[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 3: T.I]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash on 'em, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart



[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[The Notorious BIG]
Check it

[Verse: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm a rebel, I don't give a fuck about rules
Fuck college, I don't give a fuck about school
But you ass if you assume that I'm not smart
Because I made bad grades in the classroom
When I'm hustlin' I got a A average
Student of the game, I know how to make cabbage
I'm a street soldier that get no rest
Stickin' niggas for the cream is my M-O-S
And I'm always hungry, ready to eat
I got a appetite for war so I cook the beef
Ever since I was a shorty, niggas actin' ludicrous
So I rolled out wit' my twin Glock 40's
You know that I'm the illest through word of mouth
And i don't toot my own horn cause you know what I'm 'bout
Man I ain't gotta caddy truck or Chevy on dubs
I got a mean mug and a 38 snub
Don't try to be like Freddie, you ain't him
Don't compare me to other rappers, I ain't them
You might've seen me in a magazine lookin' crucial
I ain't pose wit' a gun cause you know I'd shoot you dog
I come in ya face wit' two guns up
And leave a muthafucka slumped in his Yukon truck
They say the good die young but the bad guys die by the same fate
Get bullet holes put in the same place, we Heavyweights
And nah, I ain't finished
Don't include me in yo' petty beef, I ain't in it
Cause if I'm in it then it's on, fuck writin' another song
I'mma show up at yo' home, put the toast to yo' dome
Cause niggas get clapped and shit get deeper than rap
So I suggest you don't go deeper than that
So before you diss Fred, use yo' head
You don't wanna end up dead over somethin' you said
I ain't sayin' I'mma kill you if you diss me on the mic
I'm sayin' I'mma kill you if you threaten my life
A couple rappers they be sayin' they gon' kill me on sight
It's fucked up cause I see them niggas every night
And they don't jump it off cause they bitch made
If I ain't got a gun then I'mma slit yo' throat wit' a switchblade
Take me out, I wish a nigga would try
I'm in the streets dyin' to live and livin' to die
And that's for real

[Outro: Freddie Gibbs]
Ugh, I'm livin' to die, come get me if you want bitch
Yeah, I done ducked down plenty of times man
A lot of cats is on these records talkin' this trash
How you gon' murk this, kill this, hurt this
A lot of y'all niggas still doin' nothin' man
Before you gon' say you gon' kill another nigga on a track man be able to back that up man
Cause a lot of y'all can not back that up man
Y'all just makin' these silly little threats out here man
Don't bring them my way
Serious, I'mma bring it back man
Rest in peace to everybody fallen
All the fallen soldiers, 2Pac, Biggie, Big L, Big Pun, Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Aaliyah, everybody man
Rest in peace to my grandfather, my uncle Wayne
Mike Langford, Quade Shepard, my homies I lost
Comin' up man we all dyin' to live, livin' to die
We make it through though



[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (back)
(Don't stop)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
We 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
Just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin'
'01's the year where I fell from blunderin'
Shady lifted his wing, then I fell from under it
Now I’m freefallin’, my career is gone into re-calling
Regardless of who’s fault, I was speedballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Then Marshall doubled back and got me from on top of the Hearse
I’m alive, nigga, Justin T ain’t got nothin' on me
'Cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realized that God’s with us, soon as I decided
To put that bottle down and pick up my Todd Bridges
The writing's on the wall
Since niggas seen me at the baseball game
With Shady and Jay-Z, suddenly everybody calls
Like, "I’m just checking on you, dog!"
While I throw up this message on the stall

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Your body language is sayin’ your confidence is gone
Well, pick ya ass up, lil' homie, come on
You just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it?
Tell 'em where to shove it straight up
You gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
Man, what a catastrophe it’d be for me to be a bitch-ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop-ass, let you piss-ants whoop me
Will be the day I say I ate poop, shit, the day that
I don't straight shoot, I'll drop outta my anti-women hate group
Say I’m a sissy faggot, record it, play it back
And put it on straight loop, you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
To see me climbing back on that wagon, got my swagger back
I was dragging, hopped back on it, grab the reigns on that bastard
And came back on 'em without remorse man
Man, of course, I’m a one-trick pony
'Cause I’ll be screaming on these whores 'til I’m hoarse!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Nah, I ain't fading yet, I’d rather stay and rap
I might've made a debt but I find excitement in wondering what I’ma write next so I don't stay in debt
Me broke, you might as well cut the embryo
Out of my momma and play catch
With the baby with AKs with baby bayonets
I’ma get rich or I’ma die trying
That's why it's either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homicide Ryan

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There's a bomb inside my head, I’m a live wire
I am on the edge, teetering on it like a totter, I might
Get on a nut like a tire iron, I have no desire stopping
So why would I drop and roll? That's how much on fire I am
Rappers are fun and I’m the time 'cause I’m just flying by ‘em
Man, I’m laughing at ‘em the entire time, why am I up?
'Cause tribulations I have triumphed, bitch, I’m fired up
"So one time for me, just let your fuckin' lighters light the sky up"

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga



[Intro: Smokey Legendary, Logic & Both
Synu, wiesz czemu jesteś najwspanialszym z żyjących?
Czemu, Tato?
Bo wyszedłeś z moich jaj Czarnuchu!
Hahahahaha


[Refren: Logic]
Pieprzyć rap!
Uderzam jak ćpun z półautomatykiem
Który ma dość i jest gotów odpłacić się każdemu
Poczuj klimat, nie ma szans, że zostawimy kogoś przy życiu
Zostawienie samobójczej notki? Pieprzyć to!
Bobby czuję się złowrogo, rozpierdala to
Nadchodzę po twojego faceta, jego kochankę a nawet dziecko
Czuje się jak chika-chika-chika Slim Shady! Ze wścieklizną

[Zwrotka 1: Logic]
Ślini mi się z ust, nikt mnie nie powstrzyma
Każdy raperze w branży, wiesz co zamierzam
Wyzywam Cię, do przetestowania mnie
Bo żaden z Was skurwieli mi nie imponuje
Może trochę wyolbrzymiam, ale jestem pełny innowacji
Mam dość tego szkolnego rapu
On jest fajny, a On nie
Czy chociaż jeden z was skurwysyny potrafi rapować?
Nie, to nie diss na branże, to oliwa do ognia
W tych czasach każdy brzmi tak samo, to jest słabe
Jak ćmy do światła, jestem prawdziwy, zabójca
Słyszycie lirykę kiedy nawijam, rozumiem siebie
Tak, tak Bobby czuje samego siebie
Takie masowe morderstwo odbije mi się na zdrowiu
Gdy rapuje w ten sposób, czy brzmię jak gówno?
Nie ma znaczenia, ponieważ rozwalam to gówno
Tak, rozwalam to gówno
O tak, O tak, rozwalam to gówno
Bobby ile razy rozwaliłeś to gówno?
Znajdź inny rym, czarnuchu, cholera

[Refren: Logic]
Pieprzyć rap!
Uderzam jak ćpun z półautomatykiem
Który ma dość i jest gotów odpłacić się każdemu
Poczuj klimat, nie ma szans, że zostawimy kogoś przy życiu
Zostawienie samobójczej notki? Pieprzyć to!
Bobby czuję się złowrogo, rozpierdala to
Nadchodzę po twojego faceta, jego kochankę a nawet dziecko
Czuje się jak chika-chika-chika Slim Shady!

[Zwrotka 2: Logic]
Nie macie gdzie się ukryć
Nazywamy to ludobójstwem
Uderzamy ich swoim bum-bum i oni giną
Zostawimy ich ukrzyżowanych, nazwijmy to ludobójstwem
Mam dziwki, mam kurwy, mam niedostępne nigdzie ciuchy!
Nie, my się z tym nie utożsamiamy
Tak, w branży jest miejsce i czas, ale jeśli nie przychodzicie z
Pokręconymi rymami i nazwiecie się najlepszymi z żyjących
To nie zasługujecie żeby tu być
Nie , nie, nie - Proszę nie rapować
Bo zostaniecie zniszczeni
Zostaniecie zaatakowani przez Bobby'iego
Sprawicie, że Bobby was rozjedzie

[Refren: Logic]
Pieprzyć rap!
Uderzam jak ćpun z półautomatykiem
Który ma dość i jest gotów odpłacić się każdemu
Poczuj klimat, nie ma szans, że zostawimy kogoś przy życiu
Zostawienie samobójczej notki? Pieprzyć to!
Bobby czuję się złowrogo, rozpierdala to
Nadchodzę po twojego faceta, jego kochankę a nawet dziecko
Czuje się jak chika-chika-chika Slim Shady!

[Zwrotka 3: Eminem]
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga jak JAY-Z
Koniec żartów, wy chuje, które nie napisałyście ani słowa
Zostaniecie wymieceni, jak podczas sprzątania
Znam typów spod ciemnej gwiazdy, jak astronauta
Pociągają za spusty jak szaleńcy
Przeładowanie, zostawiam was dziurawych w waszych furach
Wasze życia wychodzą z formy
Tak jak bejsbolista Alex Rodriguez pudłujący cały miesiąc
Czekaj, mówię o waszych furach, bo są teraz czerwone od krwi
Jak czerwony kapturek
Zjem was zamiast niej
Więc wiecie co zrobię, przebierając się za babcię
Zjem was zamiast niej
Nawiąże do psów, bo ciągle muszę wymyślać trudniejsze wersy
Ale nie spowolnię dla niedorozwojów
Bo nawet jeśli będę na was warczał jak doberman
To i tak nie zejdę na psy
Tryb bestii, moje ataki przekraczają granicę tej gry
Skumałem że, nadszedł czas, aby ludzie wyrazili skruchę
Pomyślcie zatem, że jestem rzutem z autu
Skumałem że, nadszedł czas, aby ludzie wyrazili skruchę
Tyle rymów, niby jak mógłbym być zdetronizowany?
Jestem cały w pogotowiu, jak karetka
Behemot w owczej skórze, od wschodu do zachodu
Jestem uważany za etos, najwybitniejszy w historii
Kto jest najlepszy? Nie muszę mówić nawet słowa
Raperzy wiedzą
Ale wy nie chcecie słyszeć, jak nawijam fakty
Wasze rapy prowadzą do dupy jak kość ogonowa
Albo utknęliście w swoich telefonach
Bazgram jak kura pazurem, nienawidzę samego siebie
Nie chcę słyszeć jak nawijacie wersy które ktoś napisał za was
Kiedyś zbierałem oklep od większych dzieciaków
Pozwoliłem im kraść moją hulajnogę
Wtedy nie zrobiłbym nic poza siedzeniem obojętnym
Teraz kasa nie jest problemem, jestem bogaty
Podcieram tyłek milionami
Wielki rachunek, jak dziób u dziobaka
Gąsienica idąca po marihuanę, bo szukam zadymy
A wy gnoje uciekacie, taranuje wszystko, a ciągle mi mało
Stary, widzę mojego fiuta stojącego jak manekin
Wracam do ubierania bandany i opasek na głowę
Myślę też o założeniu znowu rękawiczek z otworami na palce
Mając na wszystko wyjebane, więc pieprzyć rap
Brzmię jak pieprzony milioner z rewolwerem podręczym
Zaraz zrobię niedźwiedzi uścisk z terrierem jak Ric Flair
Nie dorośniecie mi do pięt jak skoszone grzyby
Kiedy zrzucam kamień z serca to porównują mnie do kardiologa
Wyjdę na gołe pięści, nie, pieprzyć to
Pourywam im głowy i wsadzę do góry nogami
Abra-jebana-Dabra ten utwór jest jak krew, przyciąga mnie
Atakuję go! Co,że jestem jak Dracula?
Pierdolić to gówno, wracam z łomotem
Człowieku, Przestań..

[Intro: Obie Trice]
Every man determined his definition of realness
What's real to him
Everybody got their own definition of gangsta, man
Okay, this is my definition of gangsta

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Surprise motherfuckers
You thought I never would've rised motherfuckers
It's Obie Trice motherfuckers
Look in the eyes of a real guy
I ain't got time for lies, niggas frontin' like they lyin'
Nigga ya not tough decease the bluff
These streets is too heated up for you to front
Dre laced the beat, heated up for you to bump
Real name no gimmicks, give my niggas what they want
Fuck the image of the blunt, that ain't rap dog
Be who you wanna be, but let it be fact dog
We'll never let a nigga tell you how you should act dog
Specially when you're fuckin with automatic gats, dog
These niggas ain't playin', I'm sayin'
I'm sprayin', I do my dirty work with my hands
I'm a man, layin' a nigga down, he advance
You fuckin' with my plans, I'm lookin for the tooth

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Look in my eyes
Sayin' there's a love I can hate, 'cause it's a thin line
Walk around with my chest out like I got 9 lives
Never will get to your strap before I find mine
Wonder what the future is like, look in my eyes
Real Gs anticipate they got to have mine
All the hoes shoutin' me out say it's all about time
Niggas never open they mouth 'cause they know my kind
Find it hard to figure me out, look in my eyes

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Now when Obie's up to bat, they asked Obie
How you cope with that, cope aesthetically man
I Kobe Bryant rap
I'm so defiant that the lines uninviting my rhyme
I swear I'm outta my mind sometimes
Out on the grind, my kind
Nickel and dime niggas we ain't rich yet
We on the corner with a 40 and a biscuit
Ready for bitch shit, have you drinkin' we ain't got good sense
My hood so tense, niggas so dense
I see through the life you invent (fake-ass niggas)
Slow up on how you niggas vent
You niggas ain't representin' shit
I represent school crowd killas, Detroit nigga
My nigga what, the realest exploit niggas
My nigga what, what's the point in avoidin' your feelings
You niggas feel us, we drillin' you with lyrics motherfuckers
Real life experiences, Eminem gave the clearance
So I'm here to show you niggas brilliance
Build it, Shady marine no civilian
O-Trice you fuckin' with a real one

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Look in my eyes
Sayin' there's a love I can hate, 'cause it's a thin line
Walk around with my chest out like I got 9 lives
Never will get to your strap before I find mine
Wonder what the future is like, look in my eyes
Real Gs anticipate they got to have mine
All the hoes shoutin' me out say it's all about time
Niggas never open they mouth 'cause they know my kind
Find it hard to figure me out, look in my eyes

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
This is what the streets done to me, Hung-ary
Gun on me, hopes high only keep change up community
Give it up imunnity, raise future me's
You look in my eyes that's the dream Obie's seen
Man it seems it's as easy as the rhyme Obie brings
But my eye shows things intervene
All in between It's like losin' my team
Losin' my freedom, losin' my mind, in the bing
The being I'm a being Graduated from rights of beings
To a Be-enz congratulated on life's sirenes
On your biatch I done came too far
To go backwards, my aim to extreme for y'all

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Look in my eyes
Sayin' there's a love I can hate, 'cause it's a thin line
Walk around with my chest out like I got 9 lives
Never will get to your strap before I find mine
Wonder what the future is like, look in my eyes
Real Gs anticipate they got to have mine
All the hoes shoutin' me out say it's all about time
Niggas never open they mouth 'cause they know my kind
Find it hard to figure me out, look in my eyes

[Outro: Obie Trice]
SHADY
Look in my eyes man, it ain't shit but real talk over here nigga
I would never send you elsewhere
I got hair on my nuts nigga, grown man shit
That's how a nigga get into clubs nigga
When I ain't got no ID
Flash my nuts on they ass
They walk me right in nigga
Hahahaha, yeah, Obie Trice

Ridin around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me
I don't wanna burn

[Verse 1]
Dear lord, this a letter to you
A young nigga hurt and I don't know what to do
I try to live life right but these cowards hatin'
It's like everywere I go I run into satan
Im on this earth, with my blessing and my curse
Just thinking that how we live
The ridin hurts
Even though you know me
Ever since I was birth
I'm innocent 'till you judge me and that comes first
And I ain't trying to burn lord 'cause that's the worst
Forgive me for backsliding on the rock for the thirst
I knew it was wrong got to snatching the purse
But it was cold outside I couldn't afford a shirt
Yeah I wanna go to church
But I can't be faithful
I'm always doing shows but you know that I'm grateful
I turn weak for the fruit 'cause it be tasteful
I dunno how in the world I can ever repay you

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy on me
Heard a nigga say there's a heaven for a g
If there is please save a spot for me
I don't wanna burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me
Ridin around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me

No, no

Hey Chris can you sit your little ass down my nigga
Dammm, I can't even write to god, shit

[Verse 2]
Dear lord I thank you for looking out for my fam
Helping my little brother who don't give a damn
You see my little sister done got pregnant
And my moma acting crazy it ain't changin'
And I pray, that you keep my pops preachin'
Cause if he ain't around there's nobody teachin'
And please keep my baby mama from bitchin'
Excuse my language lord but it's always friction
I wanna thank you for blessing me with my little girl
But please give me the power to fight the whole world
'Cause I swear on you if they touch my kid
I'ma be sittin down writing to you again

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy on me
Heard a nigga say there's a heaven for a g
If there is please save a spot for me
I don't wanna burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me
Ridin around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me
I don't wanna burn
No, no



[Intro]
Yeah man is like I don't been through so much man

You know its like I done did so much man I ain't got no shit to show for it man
Fuck The World man, naw Buck the world, yeah Buck the world I like that, yeeaah

[Verse 1]
Everybody trying to KILL me

Don't you TEST me, nothings going right and yeah I wanna fight
So im jumping in the night you gonna RESPECT me
I don't wanna talk my nerves bad and I having suicidal thoughts
Somebody WATCHING me I can feel the heat who ever in here is scared
I can hear they heart beat and they ain't no STOPPING me

What they DO TO ME, put me in this game give me all this fame
And expect for me to change my fuckin mind

[Hook]
You motherfuckers don't know me (Let's go)
You motherfuckers don't know me (Yeah)
You motherfuckers don't know me (Come on)
You motherfuckers don't know me

[Verse 2]
I am not going to jail, we gonna smoke our weed
We don't need no help, you don't wanna fuck with me
I do not CARE, ya won't get enough
I'm from the neighborhood where we throw the first punch
Get out my WAY, I had a bad day
My brother wouldn't have died if I had my AK, ya don't FEEL ME
I am on the edge, so when I woke up on the wrong side of the bed
You don't LOVE ME, You just like my car
And if I ever went broke you find another star
Don't you TOUCH ME, I don't need a wife
I love my lil girl but her momma needs a life

[Hook]



[Intro: Eminem (Sampled)]
"Well I definitely think that people have seen me...push boundaries, and maybe, you know, some people get inspired to do the same thing, but I got that from other people, know what I mean? Like, hip-hop has always been about seeing, and feeding off of, you know, getting inspired off of other emcees in the game, and you know, everybody gets inspired from everybody, and hopefully people could look at - I guess my career, and see how I came up or whatever and know the story, and know everything and maybe they can be inspired from it. Every few years there'd be certain rappers that'll come along and do that and some tend to do it better than others, push in front of others, someone who stood up for what they believed in, as far as freedom of speech, and you know, don't back down"

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
I earn my respect, I wasn't born with a connect
I didn't have somebody leave me an inheritance check
I didn't have a rich uncle out here droppin' my name
I didn't have an easy way for me to get in the game
I had to create the hype through the shit that I write
'Cuz I wouldn't follow the trends so I could blow over night
It ain't about ya talent it's about how long will you fight
For what you believe in, like it's a fight for your life
I worked jobs that I hated, restaurants cleaning tables
Boss is an asshole, co-workers is racist
Swallow pride 'til I was hollow inside, I had to take it
All the while in the back of my mind I knew I would make it
Beat down and degraded, fucked up and frustrated
Yeah sometimes it'll hurt you learning the virtue of patience
For all the time I was waitin', writin' rhymes in my basement
The gratification of not quitting, it feels so amazing

[Hook x2: Jon Connor]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Would you play through the pain, injured in the championship game
'Cuz all you can think about now is how far you done came
Didn't stop for the snow, went hard in the rain
Weekdays and weekends was exactly the same
Look, they say when money come, that's when most people change
They say losing yourself is the price of the fame
But they got it wrong, the glitz ain't the cause of the change
Consistent evolution with every sacrifice that was made
Constantly on the stage, hardly ever got paid
Every time you gave your all and hardly ever got praised
But you just go your hardest like you hardly ever get phased
Studio, no sleep, same clothes for days
That's when you ask yourself how bad do you want it
When the man in the mirror is your only opponent
When you got the final say on if you blow, or blow it
When everything that you worked for come down to one moment

[Hook x2: Jon Connor]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime



[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

You can do anything you set your mind to, man



[Intro: Shotti]
Aw, shit
Nah, don't do this shit, blood, don't do it to him
You sure you want to do some shit like this?
Now nigga, you know you going to get burnt or something
Bro, you can't do it, you can't do it
Just let it go
Ah shit, snap

[Verse: 6ix9ine]
You thought right when you ain't diss me
I'm a lyrical legend, I know they miss me
All you mumble rap kids, colorful hair
Can't compare to the lyrical phenomenon that's right here
Mars, Jupiter, Venus, origins and oranges combine: solar eclipse
Your mind is a eclipse of the origin, then, I, hah

And you can do anything you put your mind to
Everyone give it up for Louden Swain!



[Intro]
Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you
All your problems, everything, and follow me

[Verse 1]
If I was froze inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule, an hourglass full
Of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancin' to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshin' 'til you're black and bluish
You're actin' foolish, this music it has influenced
You to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion, true it's
Chaotic but it's got your body movin' as a unit
Unitin' together tonight, so make it last and you better just—

[Hook]
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
You better—

[Verse 2]
'Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feelin' that I'm feelin' right this minute
'Cause I feel like the night won't end 'til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck 'cause they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning
So come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

[Hook]
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
You better—



(intro)
Look..
If you had one shot...

Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see if it's true
If it's you, what you say in your rap's what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it. If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus: Linkin Park]
In these promises broken deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go... Go... Go...

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I love pissin' you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfucking bouncers, 6'2"
Who needs bullets? Soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better, 'cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em, and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not

[Chorus: Linkin Park]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I spit it slow, so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics, and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
Till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

[Chorus: Linkin Park]



[Intro]
“Loud noises!”

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Life handed me lemons, I jumped back in the public eye
And squirted lemon juice in it, by now, you just wish I’d fuckin’ die
But I electrify, get electrocuted, executed by the execution
Of my flow, too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin’ by
Choom chigga choom choom choom choom waa
Yep, yep—guess who, what’s happenin’, guy?
They told me to shit, I fell off that pot
Hopped right back on that crapper and I
Said, “Fuck it,” with a capital I, look who’s back to antag-g-onize
You don’t like it? You can eat shit, fuck off, little faggot, and die
You right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin’ at my
Shit, better get to the back of the line
If you wanna get your shot at me, what kinda crap is that battle?
What kind of rapper would I be
'Fore I let another rapper think he’s hot?
I’ll bury my face in a stinky twat and go... (Licking noises)
Girl, my head space is limited
Ain’t even room in the back of my mind
That’s why I ain’t thinking about you, I don’t got time
I done told you a thousand times
So how can I find the time to put
An alkaline battery in Royce’s back
And at the same time put juice in mine?
Goddammit, Slaughterhouse is signed!

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I’m a menace villain, my pen is sick and spillin’, my lyrics killin’
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceilin’
A nigga’s willin’ to give the listeners the sickest feelin’
Like mixin’ some Benadryl and penicillin, then I’m fillin’ the clip
With a written (Pow!), can you picture my pistol drillin’?
A million women and children when I’m illin’ but it isn’t real
It’s a rap, on the real, it’s a wrap, how could you possibly
Stop the Apocalypse when I’m atomic bombin’ the populace?
Shock the metropolis, hostile as a kid
Poppin’ the Glock at his mom’s and his pop’s
Then he hops in his drop with his iPod
Rockin’ his slaughter-ish documentation of lyrics
I write with confidence, write like a columnist-slash-novelist
I’m in this game to demolish it
Establish my dominance over prominent rappers
You poppin’ shit ’til ya opposite, I can spit ominous so spit politics
Now I’m Haile Selassie, Gandhi and Pac
Of this hip hop genre, bitch!

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 3: Royce da 5’9”]
Lyrically, I’m a cocaine Altoid
Ability so brain, it’s a no brain bow, boy (Fresh)
Physically, I’m literally a cocaine cowboy
Wait-wait, did I just go almost four bars
Without talking about my big dick?
The other day me and your thick bitch
Had a great date and we ate cake
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost
’Cause she couldn’t handle my Shake Weight
I swear, the irony of Ryan is I am bipolar while I’m rhyming
Standing beside a big ol’, (Big ol’) white bear
Neither one of us fight fair
You are literally looking at Woody and Wesley
In a movie where the white boy ain’t got to jump
Nowhere ’cause I’m here
Nigga I’m on fire, yeah and I’m every bitch’s dream
One, two I’m coming for you, I’m a big ol’, (Big ol’) nightmare
Nigga, this the slaughter, step it up
I’ll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up
After that, I’ll slap your ass again
And tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up
And that’s how you body a fucking beat (Goodbye)

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Uh, I should be the one that goes slow
Nah, get a stopwatch, clock my flow, hit the button on top
Watch your jaw drop, oh-oh, dot-dot, oh, Yaowa
When I drop, I go outer space
Blackout like Darth Vader’s face placed in a molten shower
Say something and get done proper
Mama, Poppa pouring out vodka, mama mia
Em, pass me the scissors
There’s visitors in the Slaughterhouse casa
Better jet, boy, go home, better jet, boy, G4 Chrome
Better jet, boy, Mark Sanchez, Santonio Holmes
I’m not your any old homeboy
Just sitting in the lab picking up a pad, I be spitting bad
I’mma get you mad with this gift I have
Little ducks sufferin’ succotash when the trigger blast
I’ma put your beak on your fitted hat
Where the liquor at? Sip a yac bad bitch and a vicious track
I relididax slide Pro-Dools to both
So smooth I coast to the West like where Crooked living at?
New York, here’s a piggy back ride
To the motherland, hold on, brother man
On the other hand, get down, I’m gutter, fam
Gun butt you with the Eagle handle Cunningham
I don’t wanna talk, I just wanna beef, I don’t want a piece
I want it all, baby boy, I don’t wanna eat, I wanna feast
Stuff my cheeks with rough beats and shit
You done, weak, I’m the one, capisce?

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Verse 5: Joe Budden]
Uh, insane what they call us, how you married to the game
But you probably shouldn’t have came to the altar
Every bar like propane for the sawed-off
You shoulda hang and they’ll fault ya
Eminem, Mr. Porter, slaughter my sentiments, eminent torture
All of you feminine marauders
They’re swimming that water, men will assault ya
Tommy’s and bats to resemble Lasorda
Kidnap your trembling daughter
At least a quarter, I’m a menacing supporter
It’s got an aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah
Normally, something’s wrong with me
Blame it on quantity of the porn I see on the pawns to me
When I fix the game, y’all think shit came with a warranty
How the fuck are they gonna stop what I was born to be?
Corner me, shit belong to me
Two choices, you can get along with me
Or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all he missing is heels to be RuPaul
Ain’t nobody that’s real ever knew y’all
And I’m second to none and I’m dealing with bums
Whose time'll never come, now deal with the blue balls
You ain’t gotta fear me but you respect me
Niggas who never met me threaten me, want to Gillette me
Comin’ to a sword fight against a machete
Swinging spaghetti like it’s heavy
Some said he deserve an ESPY, in a Chevy like Andretti
Put the desi where his chest be

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!



For all the ladies out there
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
And now you're lying in the corner, crying



[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under— (*slurp*) —stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)."
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the—

[Bridge: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick."
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—

[Bridge: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (with Eminem)]
(She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more)
(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace 11 stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the—

[Outro: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love



[Intro: Obie Trice]
You don't see me in the hood
That's 'cause I'm doin' this, man

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas, I'm still grindin' (yeah), I still hearin' those sirens
I'm still gettin' chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writin' more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I’m here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (for sure)
And I can’t let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobie, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
'Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps goin' on
And that 'ac goin' on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from tourin'
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfuckin' mouth, and show me love, bitch

[Hook]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

[Interlude: Obie Trice]
(I don't love you, bitch)
Right we wanna love alcohol
We wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
That's sorta unique 'cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie, you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

[Hook w. (Obie Trice adlibs)]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (and all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
911 Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fuckin' 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eatin' popcorn right, rewindin' the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape
I'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep-throat (Yeah)

[Hook]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (and all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

[Collision: 50 Cent]
I love the burners
The money, the bunnies, I just wanna hold ya
I just wanna love ya



[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
(And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe)
I can't breathe
But I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right
It's like I'm in flight
(High off a love
Drunk from the hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love it the more I suffer)
I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown
(She resuscitates me)
She fucking hates me
And I love it
Wait
Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't come back
We're running right back
(Here we go again
It's so insane
'Cause when it's going good
It's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back
She's Lois Lane)
But when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2]
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
When you're with them
(You meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit 'em)
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills
Used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
(You swore you've never hit 'em
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom
In your words
When you spit 'em)
You push
Pull each other's hair
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
(So lost in the moments when you're in 'em)
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over
It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playing' over
But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3]
Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back
Into the same patterns
Same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love
You're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much
To walk away though
Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist
At the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
Even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed
And set this house on fire

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie



[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, it's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it; "Wait! Where you going?"
"I'm leaving you”, "No, you ain't, come back!"
We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name

I love the way you lie



On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right

Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

She ******* hates me and I love it
Wait! Where you going?
"I'm leaving you" No you ain't!
Come back, we're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

Who's that dude? I don't even know his name

[Hook: Benatar]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Puff Puff]
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll lay my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know its lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to ******* leave again
Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire!

[Hook: Benatar]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie



[Verse 1]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glasses shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you always win
Even when I'm right
Cos you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

{​Bridge}​
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who’s counting?
I may have hit you three times, I’m starting to lose count
But together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I’m in my fucking mind, without you, I’m out it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

This morning
You wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup, as we lay in the wake of destruction
Shh! Hush, baby
Speak softly
Tell me how awfully sorry you are that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room, and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you I'm nothing

Then after that, shove me
In the aftermath of the destructive path that we're on
Two psychopaths, but we know that no matter how many knives that we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs cuz we're that lucky
Together we move mountains
Let not make mountains out of mole hills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'
I may have hit you three times
I'm startin' to lose count
But together we'll live forever
We found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refuse counsellin'
Our house is too huge
If you move out I'll burn all two thousand square feet of it to the ground
Ain't shit you can do about it
Cuz with you I'm in my fuckin' mind
Without you I'm out it

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie



[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out
We know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know, that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh why must we try, is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it yeah
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's "someone else"
Problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop-la, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time girl I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more



[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 1]
Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch, you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 2]
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Intro: 2Pac] I'm loyal to the game

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I've got task on a nigga's ass
Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

[Chorus: 50 Cent (2Pac)]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game

[Chorus: 50 Cent (2Pac)]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Leap frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

[Chorus: 50 Cent (2Pac)]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

[Outro: G-Unit & 2Pac]
Heh
YA!
2Pac's in this motherfucker!
Uh!
G-Unit in the motherfuckin' house
50!
Banks!
Buck!



[Intro: Bizarre]
Mike Strange
Welcome to Our World
Turn your CD's up!

[Eminem]
WOOO!!!!! Yeah! AAAAAAHHHH!!!! (Motherfuckers think they know us)
Guess who's back? D-Twizzie! O-Trizzy!
Doc-Drizzy! Shady-Twizzie slash Aftermath!
50 cent! G-Unit! Here we go! Free Yayo!
Motherfuck a Benzino! They don't know we finna blow!
Someone better tell them so

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
You don't know McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most coldest, ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, acting like they ain't did shit
When you rapping never mix business up with your friendship
If you lacking up in this jungle, then what you breathe for?
Niggas's don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automatically get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with C-4
These hoes have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keeping .44's where your hoes are swallowing deep throat
If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close
Niggas pupils that's what I do, I'm foolish will shoot you
Cuz' I'm coo-coo, but I don't think niggas be taking heed though

[Hook: Kon Artis] (2X)
See I'm a man, and a man gon' do what he gotta do
And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you
If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do
And be loyal to crew when crew was loyal to you

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I don't give a fuck, I'm quick to blaze chronic
Smoke on so much green, you swear I was a supersonic
Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to nuns and wives
Now who the fuck want to fight?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, Ain't nobody fucking with the D
They get beat like a M-P
You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs
You heard about Proof wilding in the clubs
You heard about that nine that Eminem packs
You diss us, you get your fucking face cracked
I'm from 7 Mile and Stout, I'll shoot up your house
Next day, I'll pee in your mouth

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Ayo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it
Most of these niggas neglect it
Even though it's a known method
From the hectic hood that you slept in
You wanna be an exception
That's when the weapon is leaving you half steppin'
With that 'caine in your left hand
Obie from a section that'll stain up your flesh and
Have you on bed breast
Questioning your affection for streets
D-Twizzie no question
One of the best groups that done it
And Obie is their reflection
Lil homie that know soley that loyalty is reppin'
D-Twizzie for life, Obie Trice is second

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 4: Proof]
Which one of you niggas wanna be bulsh' and bump heads
When I got a passion for clapping... with one hand
Talent's on my roster this mobster'll dump lead
Send a gangsta to sleep two by two like bunk beds
Never leave the crib without packing my black burner
On some Chi Ali rapper to murk and have murder
Incorporated, Hitman Harry is at your service
Reach for me one more gain' and that's curtains
For life as D12, no ice and spreewells
Every night that I chill in, I fight by free-will
Knowing I can be killed
Leaving my group, pieces of proof
With a reason to shoot and a license to ill
We lost Bugz and I'll be damned if we loose another man from our clan
Without forcing our hand
Extorting your family, I'll torture your granny
For my niggas, I'm on your motherfucking porch with a Cammy

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 5: Da Brigade (Kuniva & Kon Artis)]
Yo, it's funny how niggas get caught alone (And get bombed on)
Knock your teeth in back of your throat (And break you're jaw bone)
(I'm on ignorant shit) these niggas is bitch
Pass me a cigarette quick (Shit is finna get thick)
Your man'll get split (By a brutal and critical hit)
With identical dents (Or bullets with identical prints)
I'm wishing you if (You come your Lieutenant's a snitch)
Your timid and sick (And we know you ain't finna do shit)
I'll stick with my clique (The Kon Artis, Bomb Artist)
Kuniva, The Rida (Shooting through your fucking Long John garmets)
Dirty Dozen (We deep in the street)
Unbelievable heat, we'll even lay you out in front of the chief of police
Motherfucker

[Hook] (2X)

[Outro: Kon Artis]
Yeah! D-Twizzie
D12, Dirty Dozen
Nothing but family up in this motherfucker
Loyal to everything that we do
You ain't never gonna catch none of us slipping by ourself
Cause we always together
You know what I'm saying
Y'all niggas don't know what family means
Bugz watching over our ass
That's why we still alive now
Knocking y'all niggas out of the clubs and shit
Haha! Runyon Ave Baby!
Shady Records! Haha!
Where your momma at, nigga?



[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice



[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, ho fatto un sacco di cose in passato, lo ammetto
Non mi rimangio quello che dico, se l'ho detto allora intendevo ciò
In tutta la mia vita ho voluto un grammy, ma probabilmente non lo avrò mai
Non ho mai avuto un trofeo o una cazzo di coccarda (Yah l'ho detto)
Fanculo il sistema, sono quel negro, piega la legge, taglia le regole
Sto per rischiare tutto quanto, non ho troppo da perdere
Avete mangiato fin troppo tempo, è il mio turno di togliere il cibo
Passa il piatto! Dov'è il mio drink? Questo è il mio giorno, fortunato tu
Fanculo anche a te woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi
Fatemi spazio, fatemi spazio, datemi il rispetto
Salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori e sparo
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, datemi il rispetto

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Indietro alle mie stronzate, la mia schiena al muro
Vi volto le spalle, siete tutti finiti
Indietro a questi proiettili, si ritorna al lavoro
Tiro fuori il mio MAC e tutti voi correte
Indietro alla merda sul blocco, si ritorna allo spaccio
Questi pacchi e in realtà sto pompando
Non posso fottere con voi rapper, praticamente voi succhiate cazzi
Potrete aver fatto platino, ma quello non significa niente
Sto per fare un casino sta volta
Dritto fuori dalla cucina, gli ho detto che il forno è mio
Non fotto con voi ragazzi
Se non vi uccido, sappiate che soffrirete questa volta
Non sono un gangster, ma ho qualche pistola
Qualche catena e qualche lama e un paio di nove millimetri
Mannaie e pistole, una pernice, un pero
I miei "Dodici giorni di Natale" non furono nient'altro che bugie
Vi corro incontro come un lottatore di sumo (sumo)
Poi dicono che parlo come un coglione (coglione)
Vivo su Marte ma non sono Bruno (woo)
Stronzo sono un cane, chiamami Cujo (rah)
Tu giochi le tue carte, io te le rimando indietro
E potrei metterne giù quattro come a Uno (bup)
È meglio che tu stia zitto, frocio, puttanella e tutti voi codardi
Hanno inventato un level up nel ghetto per diventare vecchi
Cercando qualcosa che probabilmente non posso trovare
Questa merda diventa importante finché un altro beef non muore
In realtà un negro mi vuole legato e basta
Sono sempre stato solo e non ho mai avuto bisogno di nessuno
Solo me e la mia mitraglietta, dirò a questi negri di giacere per terra
Tenetevi i soldi, non ho mai voluto quello stile di vita
Prego solo Dio affinché mio figlio stia bene, ora
Ho detto niente amore per l'altra sponda
O per qualcuno che voglia del fumo (Joyner)
Quando morirò verrò ricordato come l'underdog che non ha mai perso la speranza
Sei nel taxi sbagliato sul sentiero sbagliato
Negro, via sbagliata, strada sbagliata
I serpenti nell'erba cercano di strisciare in fretta
Ho appena comprato un fottuto tosaerba

[Bridge: Eminem]
Ho detto tante cose nella mia vita, lo ammetto
Questo è in qualche modo una vendetta, mi pento di averle dette
Ho vinto un paio di Grammys ma ho venduto l'anima per averli
Non era per i trofei, solo per il fottuto riconoscimento
Quale cazzo è la differenza?
Sono io quel bianco, piega la legge, fanculo le regole
Ero solito rischiare tutto, ora ho troppo da perdere
Ho mangiato abbastanza, il mio stomaco dovrebbe essere pieno
Ho appena mangiato, lecco il piatto, questo è il mio buffet, beato me
Che cazzo pensi? (woo!)
Ho un po' di ville
Non ho ancora maniere
Tu hai un paio di ghost writer
Ma a questi bambini in realtà non importa
Mi chiedono, "Che cazzo è successo all' hip-hop"
Ho detto  "Non ho alcuna risposta."
Perchè ho incassato una sconfitta quando ho fatto uscire il mio ultimo album
Mi ha fatto veramente male ma sono ritornato questi rapper
E venendo veramente da umili origini+
In qualche modo vincendo non sono a mio agio
Vorrei poter dire "Che senzazione meravigliosa!"
Stiamo facendo il botto come se stessimo spingendo il soffitto”
Ma sembra che nessuno abbia delle cazzo di abilità
Perfino per mantenersi su un argomento, questo mi uccide
L'inabilità di mantenere l'umiltà
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, perchè non facciamo un mucchio di
Fottute canzoni sul niente e ci balbettiamo sopra?
Fanculo, andrò per la giugulare
Questa merda è un circo, voi clown che uscite fuori
Non date il minimo cazzo di peso
A quelli che erano qui prima di voi che avete fatto rap
Ricapitoliamo, prima gli MC spaccavano sulle cassette
ADAT, dove sono i G Rap e i Kane?
Abbiamo bisogno di 3 mazzette da 1000 il prima possibile, e riportate Masta Ace
Perché la metà di questi rapper hanno un danno cerebrale
Tutto quel rappare sulla lean, quei tatuaggi in faccia, sciroppati come la linfa di un albero
Non odio la trap e non voglio sembrare infuriato
Ma in effetti, dov'è il vecchio me? Lo stesso gatto
Che prenderebbe quel feed-back e risponderebbe, ne ho bisogno
Ma credo che sia inevitabile
Sanno quale bottone premere o quale leva tirare
Per farmi scattare (troietta)
E se gli do ascolto probabilmente peggioro le cose
Ma avete preso i vostri cazzi nel culo, troia (capito?)
Ull’orlo, ogni minuto mi faceva pensare di finire
Tutto con acetominofene e raccoglierne i benefici
Sono di nuovo addormentato al volante
Mentre penso all'intento malvagio
Di uccidere un altro beat
Perché anche se dovessi finire di nuovo ad ingoiare un'altra pillola
Anche se fosse ketamina o metanfetamina con il minithin
Dovrebbe essere almeno dai 70 ai 300 milligrammi
E potrei anche farlo, perché finirò di nuovo ad essere un cattivo
Questo ha dei livelli, io ho un ascensore
Non potresti mai dirmi che non sono un cazzo di distruttore di record
Sembro un disco rotto ogni volta che infrango un record
Nessuno potrebbe mai cancellare l'eredità che ho lasciato, non ho mai compiaciuto
Figlio di puttana, so che ora ho il diritto di essere così
Ho il dispetto nel mio DNA
Ma ho scritto finché le ruote non si staccano, sto lavorando senza mai stancarmi, ayy
È il momento che aspettavate tutti
Come la California che spera che diluvi
In quella siccità, avete tutti pregato per
La mia caduta da 8 Mile a Southpaw
Ancora lo stesso Marshall, quel fuorilegge
Del quale dicono che come scrittore potrebbe essere caduto
Sono tornato su quel toro come i cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi
Fatemi spazio, fatemi spazio, datemi il rispetto
Salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori e sparo
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, datemi il rispetto



[Lupe Fiasco]
Lu myself, first of all accuse myself for being a fool
All attempts to school myself have failed
To improve means to remove myself
From this pool of sharks, dark as the mood I felt
I’m losing fuel, that’s all the food I refuse myself
That’s how you do when you do yourself
And if I lose, I could never excuse myself
Till I grow old, sit back and accrue my wealth
You don’t stand a chance, matter of fact, you don’t have half the stance
To stand if you stood half a chance
Like c-h-a to dance with this man from the C.H.A’s
Give it up, just abandon plan
Since you don’t have half the stance like an amputee
You don’t have half the pants that it takes
To command a family
The fan or command a fee
So you will never get the ransom you demand from me
The good news, my foot’s loose, my hands is free
So I dance all footloose and fancy free
Big Ups to footloose and all the fans of me
My fan base expands from Vans to Timberlands
From mansions to Section 8 campuses B
I’m they champion and I ain’t even SoundScanned it, see, I been lamping
Whipping up an answer to these rappers who got it backwards
Like zipping up their pants to pee
Like I’m just a rapper and I ain’t dapper
I'm frequently fly, I can go to France for free
But I ain’t no fan in base, cooking up grams of C
We in a wet stretching O’s like rubber bands to feed
But that was white boy 100 grand to key
When I’m posted up with this little punk ass chump cash advance
That they handing me, I came back with birds like Brandon Lee
I came back with words in a stanzas G
Told ya, right back like Stan, I'mma stand till it answers me
I’m concentrating man, I'm an oscillating fan
When they wanna shake hands with me, it sucks right now
Hear it through ya spirit just dampens B
Like damn that was my man, what the hell happened to he?
His fan base is disbanded B
‘Cause his lyrics don’t mirror when he first landed see
Don’t give into this land to please
So help me God, I'mma kill it, that’s my word
Remove this blindfold, just give us a chance to see
And I'mma quit it the minute it abandons me
My plan’s to be here for a minute
Then I’m finished, then I’m vamping G
Most these cats is pussies, pearl tongues, oysters and clams to me
Flintstone money can’t even stand being in their glances geez
They say it’s looking good, from my vantage B?
Shit is sinking like Atlantis B and I’m more set than Alanis
What, you ain’t understanding me? Am I speaking Spanish B?
Well adios holmes, am I getting sloppy Joe? Well what am I, a Manwich B?
I got a Big Mac if you want a sandwich G
Who else you know keep the Mickey D tucked
With the windy on his shoulder? I told ya, give it up dog, it’s over



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Y'know, Detroit and Buffalo are kinda like long lost cousins
That's why, to me, it makes sense
Shady and Griselda
Y'know, I felt like this before
Nostalgia, bitch
Just Blaze

[Verse 1: Conway]
Uh, let the drum off quick
Youngin running through that shortcut  he dump off blick
Youngin dope off stick
I made one call, he slumped y'all quick
Nigga, there's room in the trunk, y'all fit

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, this for my niggas on the bus taking up north trips
SKS in the Dolce trench
Dice game mittens to the floor throwing trips
Throwing bricks, bring me back 80 by the 5th

[Verse 3: Conway]
Look, jet fuel, blow a zip full
20 racks, blue hundreds, that's a fistful
I stand over the stove, whip that brick good
Rap shit don't work out? Fuck it, my wrist good

[Verse 4: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, just turned two to three and a half
And it still fire, ate through the bag
Gucci duffel with snakes on the bag
I keep my grass shorter, Patrick [?]
No top Rocky, you're shit boring

[Verse 5: Conway]
Sparking dust, I'm the ash on your foreign
[?], another foreign
If this was '98, I would've fucked Lauryn
My dog lost 100 bags and got 100 more of 'em

[Verse 6: Westside Gunn + Conway]
Gave 20 to my lil niggas
Break it all down, you get the bigger picture
Elevator in my bitch house
Shot the fuck nigga bitch house
Went from the shells, knock the crib over
This ain't playing with you niggas
Went from the shells, knock the crib over

[Verse 7: Conway]
Bought a brick, nigga, gave me two bigs over
I'm the illest, I put that on my life
A rap nigga blood, I put that on my knife
The D squared tack it was lavender and white
Eating alligator bites, 20 racks, get a half a key tonight

[Verse 8: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, connect got 'em half of the price
Shoot it, ain't hear shit, it was a clapping invite
This the Passion of Christ, 'cause niggas wanna hang me
Niggas out in Paris wanna paint me
The four pound never on safety
All these bad bitches want me lately
Drops sound like AZ
Then I copped the Lam, who wanna race me?

[Verse 9: Conway]
Yeah, back to back Lams, I let my bitch drive
Think I'm slipping like Six from the fifth flight
Sticks got the trash bags and the zipties
Sit it underneath the fan, let that brick dry

[Verse 10: Westside Gunn]
Cooking fish like a fish fry
Chrome 800, that's the big guy
Hit the nigga with the dummy brick
Locked up in Ohio, me and money grip

[Verse 11: Conway + Westside Gunn]
50 rounds back to back, let 100 rip
Nigga screaming like a bitch when his stomach hit
The nigga brains hit the ceiling
Thank God for drug dealing
Uh, and my aunt catching, whipping Os up
Uncle showed me how to make the stove jump
The shit jump like Zach LaVine
War medium tan and low green
My plug sniffed the whole thing
30 in his clip, youngin blicked the whole thing
30 in his clip, youngin blicked the whole thing



[Intro: Young Zee]
*Talking*
I'm allowed to fuck up whenever... whenever I want...
This the Outhouse...
Lemme smoke a joint first...
Here, Pace...

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
95% of all y'all rappers is buzz
And y'all ride dick so much y'all gon' make me nuts
You'll get your jaw clocked, I'll drag your ass for four blocks
Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice, stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog 'til my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, "If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls!"
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
I fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets me high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Bridge: Young Zee]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Hook: Young Zee]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa

[Verse 2: Slang Ton]
Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip-hop fat as your lip got when I
Kickboxed with flip-flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby?
You borin' like foreign Dice, I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga, I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'

[Break: Az-izz, (Young Zee), & [D.U.]]
Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy?
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high?
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye (uh-huh)
Leave him paralized and (agonized)
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
[Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Huh?]

[Verse 3: Pace Won]
Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like Brownstone you couldn't "Take The Crown Home"
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, dickin' 5-0 in a stolen gray Hummer

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the blank sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from a city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan

[Hook By: Eminem]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and moi
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Refrain: Young Zee]
(Yeah!)
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
We fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets us high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Bridge]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Hook: Young Zee & Eminem]

[Outro: Young Zee]
Mama-mama-mama-mama-macosa
*talking*



[Chorus: French Montana]
Watch me make what I lost
I ain't gotta choice it is what it be
Watch me make magic
I pull that pigeon out the hat
Pull that 50 out the bag
Gunning, niggas out here dumbing
It ain't where you from, it's where ya at

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got an axe in the bag, couple of fags
Stuffed in the backseat muzzled and gagged
Wrapped in bubble wrap 2 lesbians a couple hustler mags
Now grab the pez dispenser
Fill it up to the max with muscle relaxers
The governor of Alaska
She lusts when I ask her
To shove my pulaski sausage up in her ass huh
While we hover over Nebraska
Shooting at the fucking Buffalo pastures
In the helicopter man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screaming grab my titties shady suck on those bastards
But I ain't no sucker
I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a Gigolo, bitch I look like the Juggalo rapper?
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper
But shit back down, man I'd rather lick on the scrotum
And eat the fuckin' octo mom pussy lips with some okra
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissor with Oprah
While Rosie pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get the boner and play dick swords with the Jonas Brothers
Your motherfucking mothers aromas
Like no other I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...

[Chorus: French Montana]
Watch me make what I lost
I ain't gotta choice it is what it be
Watch me make magic
I pull that pigeon out the hat
Pull that 50 out the bag
Gunning, niggas out here dumbing
It ain't where you from, it's where ya at

[Verse 2:French Montana]
I'mma take em to the top
They ain't fucking with the top deal
Top player im the new Dre, Snoop, Pac
Big chain ice hot
His slang white block
Bread pumping like speakers
Flow Ether like Nasir
You can bulletproof ya truck and get shot still
Shots peel, 40 turn your brains into oxtail
Pop pills, shawty pussy right but her top real
She took the condom off and jerked me off like the lox's deal
All I bump is Jada and Max
Bent with the cramium cracked
Smoother like that henny and black
I be the mac with the 2 slugs, ski mask
Two gloves ask about them boys tall like manute was

[Chorus: French Montana]
Watch me make what I lost
I ain't gotta choice it is what it be
Watch me make magic
I pull that pigeon out the hat
Pull that 50 out the bag
Gunning, niggas out here dumbing
It ain't where you from, it's where ya at



[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
’Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Mmm, uh, yo, I got the money and the power now
The G5'll get me out there in an hour now
The MAC movin’ like crack, I'm sellin' powder now
G-Game over, locker room, hit them showers now
I got the trophies and the catalogue
Just did a deal, Mercedes-Benz, check the catalogue
I'm buyin' buildings, we don't buy the blogs (Kyuh)
The Nicki challenge when I fly to Prague, uh

[Refrain: Labrinth]
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, who want it with Nicki now?
I smoke ’em like hippies now
They see me, say, "Yippie," now
Homes runnin’ like Griffey now
They switchin' like sissies now
You niggas is iffy now
Bitches tune switchin’ up
We take 'em to Jiffy now
I'm thicker than peanut butter
He nuttin' like Skippy now
He want me to be his wife
His missus like sippi now, uh

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won’t give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (Oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also
Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle (Oh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, "All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia"
I told her, "Bitch, now, just hold up!"
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
(Speed it up a little bit)
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach
And I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, now let me hit you back
Told 'em I'd get you back
I know you sittin' there just thinkin' 'bout who did you that
I am who did you that
You trippin', did you pack?
Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin' Nicki crack
Here, take a Nicki pack
Check out this Nicki act
Nicki this, Nicki that
All these bitches piggyback
Ha, piggyback, ah, ah, ah back
Ah, ah, ah back, ah, ah

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Out ah road, they lovin' my style
The man dem want digits fi dial
Inna the dance, we a go skin out I know
And when I come out, y'all suicidal
Yeah, on the real, I'm these bitches' idol
Gotta be dumb to make me your rival
'Cause I'm too powerful ('Cause I'm too powerful)
And you not powerful (Yeah, you not powerful)
So say your prayers 'cause you 'bout to die slow (Die slow)
Die slow (Die slow), die slow (Die slow)
Jealousy is a disease, die slow (Die slow)
Die slow (Die slow), die slow
Tell her that jealousy is a disease, die slow



[Vocal Intro: Eminem]
Yo, Manix man, I think I just spotted my prey
There she is; check her out
Yea I know she's with her man and everything but...
I can still get her man, 'cause you know me
Just drop a couple of smooth rhymes on her
And I got her you know what I'm saying?
Aight, I'll tell you what I'mma do about her man!
Aight, Check this out...

[Verse]
Hey baby, let me have a word with your man
(comic-like slap sound) - now lemme show ya exactly where I stand
I'd like you to enter my fortress
Just cause you are just the most gorgeous
Woman I've ever seen and for just
The next few hours of ya life I'd like to
Bring out the real woman inside you despite you
Might be in love and all that with your, man
But lemme get chat with you
Why don't we get to know each other, haven't you
Ever wondered what it was like to date an M.C.?
Now what's a woman like you, without a man like me?
And someone like yourself I can grow very fond of
Beyond a doubt and I would always hold onto your
Love, and be faithful I promise
Cause I'm as
Loyal as a puppy, and I'd treat you like a goddess
That we would've stumble onto each other but first, wait
Before you're lured, I want to know if you're insured
And if you're sure, you're gonna be able to endure
A tremendous amount of pain that seems endless
Strenuous brawn and brain, but yet when this
Whole thing is over and I make it through the ride
Then I'd gladly stand by your side

[Intro: Trey Songz]
Hey, hey

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Now when my mama done seen me cry, it's my life
I'll be thuggin' 'til the day I die, it's my life
You niggas don't know me, you can't slow me down
You can't hold me, and so I'ma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', goin' on strong

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
They say "Why you so defensive?" I take that offensive
Comin' from the shit that I lived in
You wouldn't understand him unless you eyewitness
Chillin' on the block where vacant lots are given
Women and children missin', men in the picture
'Cause niggas hit up sittin' down and some sinner
Get a kite with a flick of a chick he once hit up
Ridiculous but that's us niggas
On the corner from dusk 'til dawn
'Til that shit Whites brought to America's gone
Be a Good Samaritan, my heritage was did wrong
So all that sufferin' that's just prolonged
Long as you're knowin' that that strong-arm robbery
Was brought on from this society deprivin' me
This brings violence if you're not survivin' my environment
Don't expect ya to be drivin' in

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Now when my mama done seen me cry, it's my life
I'll be thuggin' 'til the day I die, it's my life
You niggas don't know me, you can't slow me down
You can't hold me, and so I'ma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', goin' on strong

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Mama worked 37 years in the plant
34 days she missed, that's where I get my grind at
Her lil nigga, see her as father figure
Even though she got hips and tend to bitch up
Show me how to maneuver snakes, false niggas
Eleanor Trice, one real sister
Raised her kids up to be go-getters
Now a nigga livin' room big as a Amphitheater
Get the theater nigga, I'm from the hood
So at times I see the mirror and tell him he doin' good
Keep up my spirits 'cause niggas want him destroyed
But that's null and void when it comes to ya boy
I'm from Detroit, Shady employee
I'm on a voyage tryna get more than royalties
Niggas I'm royalty
That's why your bitches spoil me, O. TRICE

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Now when my mama done seen me cry, it's my life
I'll be thuggin' 'til the day I die, it's my life
You niggas don't know me, you can't slow me down
You can't hold me, and so I'ma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', goin' on strong

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
I got visions of makin' executive decisions
But this system tells me to be realistic
You can't do shit with C's and D's
I could do the work, I'm just interested in makin' cheese
So your schools can't control these G's
He got his own rules and do whatever he please
At ease to my soldiers that's feelin' Obie
Long as I know my 1-2-3's I'm flippin# O-Z's
A nigga can count like an accountant
Only difference is it ain't checks that'll be bouncin'
It's powder, peep what he's pronouncin'
Now he lives next to the teacher that denounced him
Doubted him, now look at the child's outcome
Duece album got him speakin' highly in volume
I assume I'm valuable, they throwin' in the towel
Bow whenever they see him roll in that Diablo

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Now when my mama done seen me cry, it's my life
I'll be thuggin' 'til the day I die, it's my life
You niggas don't know me, you can't slow me down
You can't hold me, and so I'ma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', goin' on strong

King Of Detroit, what up now fool, what up now nigga!

[Intro-Singing:]
Many men, wish death upon P
Its hard to survive in the 313
I'm trying to be what Im destined to be
And niggas tryin to take my life away
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin wit me
He ain't come dollo face in 1E
Watch what you say when you talk about me
Cuz I come and take your life away
Many men, many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Dog I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1]
Man these pussy niggas put money on head
Gonna get your refund, cuz motha fucka I ain't dead
I'm the dozen in the dirt, that ain't been found
The real king of the 'D' (shit) that ain't been crowned
When Im on, something special happens every time
Im the dopest, something like Roy Jones in his prime
I walk the planks of the jungle, got a problem then fuck you
Show you what my gun do, if you whack and unhumble
Be for real, punk niggas, your new to the beat
Ask any playa in the 'D', your new to the streets
Ya'll ain't from 7 mile, and y'all ain't wound
Fuck a bone, when you hear that *click* its a gun!

[Hook]
Many men, many many many many men wish death upon me
Dog I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men, many many many many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse 2]
Now there wouldn't be real, if it wasn't for no heart
If there wasn't 8 mile, there wouldn't be O Port
Death gotta be easy, cuz life is hard
Murk you in afterlife, and see twice the god
This is for my niggas on the yo, doin there time
The real murkers in Detroit, that shine on the ground
I heard about that little hit, that u put in the hood
But your shootifyougetshot ain't gonna do no good
Im like MG for shady, you can call me 'the Don'
If you Micheal mothafucka, you gonna die in the storm
Can't switch sides homie, let cash ride homie
Thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know how many mothafuckas wanna hear your bone break?
PA 7 Mile, FA's on May
School craft LA mack and B-wick
CCs Runyan AV. That's who 'P' wit
The cops don't know much, where I tuck my Glock
I got the word from E-dog when Stuck got locked
Ain't gunna spell it out for you muthafuckas on the grind
Are you blind nigga, can't read between the lines
From Cameon, Rico Shocka and G-low
Rock man, First born, boxy and Dlow
Now lets clear, Im here for a real reason
He do a a hit, I do a hit, lets see who's still breathin'
*gasp*

[Outro-Singing:]
Many Friends

Many friends, many many many many friends

I should have preserved my dog, poured out on the curb for ya'll
Your R.I.P
Many friends
I lost to this game, and this cocksucka coome namin names
So many hommies that passed away
Run up on him point-blank and blast away
For Lewon, Click-click, Bugs and Snook, Don't care bout all them drugs he took
Watch what you say when you talk about me, Cuz Im always gonna walk the 'D'
Many friends
That died on me
I shall have preserved my dogs, poured out on the curb for y'all
Yo R.I.P

[Interlude: 50 Cent and (Lloyd Banks)]
(Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat
Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker)
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
(50, calm down, he coming)
*9 Gunshots*
(Ahh, ohh, what the fuck)
Ah, son, pull off, pull off)

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme somethin' special happen every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say "Only God can judge me," ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pullin' TEC's on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible it says what goes around comes around
"Hommo" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me



[Intro]
You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me, 10 million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here

[Hook 1]
You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some 26 year old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my 16 dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin'
A good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (Hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh)
He said some shit in Vibe to spite me (Yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' "I don't care, just bite me!" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns ‘cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live 20 miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus"? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

[Hook 2]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, **** ******** **** ******'* * faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, "XXL! XXL!"
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

[Hook 1]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)
Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)



[Intro]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars? Get the fuck outta here

[Hook]
You see I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me

[Verse 1]
You might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
Or leaning out a window with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
Blue-and-red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that should've been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fucking brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What is this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots
In public, I'mma love it

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in Vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just...



[Produced by Eminem & Mr. Porter]

[Intro: Maxine & Denuan Porter]
Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine
She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease, tryna clear it

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?
That is to get with every brother
And unveil one of his kids
Shit, you livin' trife
Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop
But it just… slows… down…
And then speeds back to a regular pace
There is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?
I refrain from gettin' angry
But you keep on actin' strangely

[Verse 3: 3]
I met this girl last week
She was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat
And said: "Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?"
Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped
Throughout my hands, and said: "Oh, it's like that?"
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine
So I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine too
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation
That's when she asked me could I fuck
I said: "Maxine, check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out."
Got to the crib, she let me in
She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand
And proceeded to the bedroom
I said "Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things"
What the fuck are you doin'?
So I went for my protection
Took off my clothes and started flexin'
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work
Before I hit it she said: "3, don't get mad
But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass."
I said "What is it? Another nigga? It's okay."
She said: "No I forgot to tell you
That I got AIDS, I got a problem."

[Outro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]
Hey, Maxine
What?
You thinkin' about suckin' my dick?
Yeah, for a small price
For a small price? What you mean?
You know, money, nigga
You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
What you, what you hear I got?
AIDS
Who told you that bullshit?
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Oh for real, it's like that?
Well, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit
And if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fuckin' around with no third nigga
Fuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you
No, see…
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Hold on, why it ain't even like that
I want y'all to get paid, fuckin'



[Intro: Eminem]

1, 2, 6, 8, 10...

[Verse 1: Eminem in the style of Vanilla Ice but rapping as himself]

YO! I'm Back, to bust another fresh track
You say, that I have the ability to fly
Fly right pass ya ass, when I blast
Ya everytime I grab the mic, I crash a-
Nother rhyme it's a crash landin'
Everytime I grab the mic, I'm kinda outstandin'
Cuz no-one can step to, a single a rhyme
And I say " Yo, what kept you?
Holmes, you going too slow
You're too slow for the flow " and I know
That Eminem is returning
To bust the rhyme and suckers are learning
That when I kinda go offbeat a little bit
I step back to the rhyme and say
That I bust a rhyme all day
Make a sucka say "Hey!
I cannot step to you Eminem
Cuz you are so bad, Damn
You're the baddest motherfucker in the whole damn land"
And you're right, cuz I am
And I don't go offbeat, not once
Cuz I grab the mic and bust for months
And I don't give nobody another turn
Cuz everytime I grab the mic, I don't let a brother burn
Because he can't step to a single rhyme that I do
Cuz you knew you're through

[Verse 2: Proof (rapping as MC Hammer)]

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Now I grab the microphone, you know I am imperial
Is a production that rocking your stereo
Don't front with me, cuz I am the boy
I get on the microphone and I destroy
Now you can take a body, that's not from Oakland
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer keeps on choking, yeah
I can do it right and nobody will know
For I am the Hammer and I'm running the show
They come from West Indies south of California
I wake you motherfuckers up, early in the morning, yo front!

[Interlude: Eminem (hereafter rapping as Vanilla Ice)]

Yo Hammer, that was pretty good man
I don't think I can step to you man, I don't know
(Proof:  ... I'm great!)
I'll just try but it seems like you outdo me, no matter what I do
(Proof shouts something unintelligible)
Here I go anyway

[Verse 3: Eminem]

Here I am, back to attack the whole damn land
You know that Vanilla Ice is hype
I grab this mic and I rhyme all night
MC Hammer cannot step to me
Because I got the rhymes and I'm truly
So damn hype and the place to be
I'm rhyming on the mic on the M-I-C
M-I-C is the abbreviation
I grab the mic and rock the whole nation
You know that Vanilla Ice, is so precise and I get so nice
Get so nice, I start developing manners
And I whoop your brain like "Scanners"
Because Vanilla Ice is bad
Now what you got to say about that dad?

[Interlude: Proof]

You can't step to me boy
I sell more records!
Yo. I know here I go.  Yo Manny gimme something yeah!

[Verse 4: Proof]

Now everytime I go, you know I like to start
My name is MC Hammer
I rule hip hop charts
Seven million seven million seven million sold
And your shit barely even touch gold!
Now everywhere I go, they know that I'm a star
I'm the  H -A-M,  the M -E -R
Cuz every time I rock it they know I rock the mic
I am MC Hammer
And you know what I am like, ROAR!

[Interlude]

Eminem:  I don't know man, I think you got me, man. I don't know. I'mma try.  Check this out.  Fallin'...
(Music speeds up)
Proof:  Ain't no one here you sucka!
(Music returns to normal)

[Verse 5: Eminem]

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in the car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I try to get away 'cause the jackers jack
So I step to the rhyme and I just say I'm
Gonna bust a rhyme for the whole damn mind
Then you say that I cannot bust a rhyme
But you gonna get got MC Hammer
Because you know you get on the mic
And drop poor grammar
And you can't slam a jam because I know that I am the man
And all the teenagers they like ME
You know why? It's a scheme agents
Have developed to sell me
Because I bust a rhyme so cleverly
And you know that I got knowledge
Cuz I'm in show biz
And I bust a rhyme all the time
So MC Hammer you cannot step to
A single rhyme that I do cuz I knew
That you are through, you are washed up
Oh, so step to the back room
And I told you that I have to scold you
Because I am Vanilla Ice
I grab this mic and I get so precise
And you cannot step
So why don't you get swept?

[Interlude: Proof]

Now you makin' me mad boy
Now I'm gonna get your ass
Now you gonna know who's on this motherfuckin' mic! Yo!

[Verse 6: Proof]

It's about time that I turned out your lights
Now I see the Vanilla Ice tryin' a chill in my freezer
You just don't know that your mama is a geezer
She say Hammer, yo Hammer, yo Hammer Hammer Hammer
But she jump on me because I'm a bad mamma jamma
I did your bitch, Hammer don't play
I got the funky shit and it goes this way
I wish your whole ass try to step, you can't touch this
You fuck with the Hammer you'll be walking on crutches
Yeah that's what I'm sayin', I ain't playin'
I'm Hammer, I'm Hammer, yes it's the Hammer Man
My lips may be big but I can rap better
Than looking at your ass, you look like a piece of cheddar!
Yo though you steppin' to me, you know it's no dream
I dig Vanilla Ice and turn his ass into whipped cream
So you know who's the best by far
It's the muthafuckin' HammeR with a capital R, roar!

[Interlude]

Eminem: Now you made me mad.  And you know what happens when you make Vanilla Ice mad Hammer?
Proof:  What?
Eminem:  I don't like it.  So yo! (Pauses)
Proof: You scared boy?
Eminem: I ain't scared of you, Hammer. I'm just thinking. I gotta think of something clever
Eminem whispers: Ice Ice baby, too cold too cold

[Verse 7: Eminem]

When I'm through with you
You'll be goin' to heaven
Cuz I smash the glasses and fuck 3-5-7
24/7 they was bangin' my cock
I said "yo fuck Hammer
Get a piece of the rock, yeah"
I said yeah. My name is Vanilla Ice, you can't
Step to me, you thought that you was a champ
But I stepped on your ass like a piece of carpet
And rented you for sale like an upstairs apartment
Yo, that's my clever metaphor
And every time I grab the mic you know
Kids like me cuz I'm better for
Their ears, because their mothers and parents
Like to hear the way I rhyme and I make an appearance
And say hey, I got a blond streak
And that's why people like me cuz I'm hard as concrete
I'm always on beat when I do this show
You know that Vanilla Ice has to go cuz I'm so damn fresh!

[Verse 8: Proof]

Now you steppin' to me punk
There is no maybes
You steppin' to me wrong and I'm gonna ICE ya baby!
So you say what's the matter, why Hammer loves to rap
Cuz all that shit you talkin' to Hammer is bullcrap
Now I know a rhyme every day I'm ready
I'm down with Dougie Fresh, Van-L is not ready
Now everywhere I go, on MTV Rap
They know I'm the best cuz now I don't take no crap
Now Vanilla Vanilla he's beaming out Hammer
They say yo Hammer don't put me on the slammer
I said yo sucka, stupid muthafucka
You messin with me but I'm no sucka
I already pumped it up, and already got it started
So steppin to me white muthafucka you'll feel broken-hearted
So I'm gonna pass the mic and you know about me
Hammer get off the fuckin' mic!!! I'm outie!

[Outro: Eminem]

You blew me out, man, you beat me



[Intro]
Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 2]
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man, they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me
Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you (inhale)
Always hated you, and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume (inhale)
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far (inhale)
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Outro]
The world is mine



[Skit]
Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news
(Yeah, about that…)

[Intro: Candice Pillay]
Don't let me find out the bitch in you
Don't let me find out the snitch in you

[Chorus: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
Ain't nobody graduatin'
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients, man
How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are
Just admit it 'fore you get admitted

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper
But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc

[Chorus: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a (Doctor's) assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—

[Chorus: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders, Doctor's orders

[Verse 2: ApolloX]
If it's my time then I'll tell you when it's yours
But before that don't step to me, cause that'll mean your a whore
And I don't mean to be bored, but I don't give a fuck what you say about my decor
So get the fuck off my shore, and I'll show you what it means to be lord
You see these bitches think that they can control
But they don't realize who the fuck they're dealing with so they just preform
I don't think they know, and if they really flow then I'll have to show them the form
And they'll get all fucking deformed
Then I'll show them who's boss, and it's not Ricky Ross
You want to, go up in it and then show out and blow it
You got to, come out with the blow out and go out with a showdown
You needa pick up the phone and call the docs rock when the hot lock comes and the Hawks cock
Cocks the gun and socks the run and some will hate the rhythm that I have brung, so bring the damn rum and don't be a motherfuckin bum
Showing you the way of life and it won't be nothing but a fife
You get in then get out don't do nothing else cause it's just a spout and small like sour like the crout
And when the flow gets cold remember that it's gold and old
Just don't give it a small fold
You see the way I will go is in a slow but fast way and the castaways will go show and blow off the fuckers that know that they ain't shit when it comes to the game of rap and tap and motherfuckin slap the cap
All these suckers think that we fuckers but the news that you don't know is that you the pluckers and we the ones that make you suffer
So all the quickest and sickest spitting sitters and sinners come slither, slip, slide and glide and make their way to the Clyde and cynical cyanide filled bitches and snitches go and motherfuckin die
All these patients and patent protection rapping pair of partners come and say "fuck your new rap song" but I say back "fuck your company and all that reside to fly and die like my pie for a lie"
But you don't know the sound that I bring and the clowning pound of the mound when minority goes and stands out
I'm tired of all of the motherfuckin fake ass Doctors so get off my chest and you just might become a Procter
All I need is a scope and the hope that stands with the pope will soak in blood because the tamed were never ready for the...

[Intro]
Let's just go, man
Is it recording?
Yeah, let's just rhyme out our ass
Bout to kick a rhyme right outta my head
Mic check one two
Mic check one two
Mic check one two

[Verse 1]
Here I go in the place to be, rhyming like this on the M-I-C
Here's the way that I rhyme so naturally, and actually
When I grab the mic, all the people say "M&M, you're one of the funkiest MC's out today
And I say "I agree", because I am a funky dope slamming MC
I slam them back, daddy, eveytime I grab the mic and say I wanna rap, daddy
But you can't, because I take it
Grab the mic and after I'm done, I break it
When I'm done, I just slam the
Microphone and cram it right in your asshole
Because 'asshole' and 'cram the' didn't rhyme, but that's alright 'cause I'm jamming
On the microphone 'cause I'm slamming, busting out lyrics and you like to examine
My style that I'm doing, but if you step to me pursuing, I'll ruin
All your hopes and dreams, 'cause I work with my man, he's on my team
My man Manix is on my side every time the (?) they say
"Damn, how'd you make a beat like that ma'am?"
And I say "I'm not a ma'am, I'm a sir", and if you step to me your eyes'll be blurred

[Bridge]
One two
One two mic check-a one two
One two one two
Mic check-a check one two
Mic check-a one two one two
Mic check three four six seven eight

[Verse 2]
Mic check one two
Do unto others as you would have them do to you
No, that's not the way I work because
When I rhyme I'm a jerk
I grab the mic and start dissing
All these MC's and try to put them into submission
Take them out for the count because the amount I throw is so deaf
Word! Deaf didn't rhyme but I
On your windshield just like a turd
Every time that I rhyme you know that I'm
Going to climb to the tip tip top and I'm
Not going to stop 'cause I grab the mic and dop-da dop dop
I fucked up, but that's alright because my luck's up
No it's not, 'cause here I am, I got a lot to give
And I don't live positive
Now I'm not saying I'm negative
But if I grab the mic I do mega kits
Every time that I grab the mic you know that M&M is gonna be rolling his tongue just like this
And then I go do a funky rhyme and if any MC steps up he gets fucking dissed
Bad, don't call me dad
Vanilla Ice said that, that made me mad
So when I step to the mic
Know that I gotta clear my throat and excite
I'm trying to get the mic cord away from the stereo so I can bust some material
I take it around my leg, and then all the MC's wanna beg
And say "Yo, please give me a turn!"
I say "No" because it's my turn to burn
And I bust a rhyme like this and you can't step to a rhyme that I do 'cause you're dissed!
You're dissed so bad every time
Sure, he don't get a turn, and he's starting to get mad but I'm
Just going to take the mic, I'm not gonna give it to him because I am
So damn hyped in the place to be
Rhyming like this 'cause I'm an MC
Rhyming so deaf to the happy ass beat
It's kinda gay like Liberace but hey
Listen to the words that I display every time I kick a rhyme this way
You know that the star is worthwhile, every time I grab the mic I'm longer than I mile

[Verse 3]
I waste no time, when I can't flip I caper
I cut your butt up like G Floyd like paper
When I bust a rhyme I'm a stud
That's what I like to say, jump on my pud
Girly girly, would you like to fuck me fuck me in my house early?
Or late, I don't care, let's make a date 'cause I don't pump weights to get dates
Just because I'm huge, I bust a lyric
But I get greedy like a Scrooge
When I grab the mic it's kinda stingy
I kick rhymes that ain't dingy
When I bust I'm like forcillin
You try to grab the mic and force it again
But you can't 'cause you are speechless
And I get sandy like teachers
I get sandy, I grab the mic handy
It's so I can get candy
When I bust the shit I get like a noogie
Then I boogie, boogie on down because
Every time that I kick a rhyme I just 'dud'
I meant to say 'do', but I got an addiction to friction every time I kick non-fiction
Non-fiction science, every time I grab the mic I got the alliance
Right behind me stepping into the 90's, you know you'll try me and you'll die, G
So don't even try it, I don't buy it, so you'd better keep quiet
'Cause you're into it, ain't nothing but to do it

[Verse 4]
You'd better catch up 'cause you're trailing
You'd better put springs in your ass and jump like Van Halen
Every (time I bust a) rhyme I get like a panther if you're lying that slander
'Cause you're lying like Berry Saunders, every time I grab the mic I get married and I
Like to kick a rhyme that I pick
Every time I pick the mic up I stick
A dick right up your ass like a faggot
You're gonna die, be crawling with maggots
Every time I dread you like hair, I said you'd better get (?) on your underwear
You'd better run, 'cause if you don't
Afraid you'll be seeing a ghost like a Rake
You ain't an eighth of me, every time I grab the mic girls try to act so faithfully
But I say "No, don't be a fan. Just try to step to my dick and act like a man"
No, that don't make no sense but every time  I cut class like a pair of scissors I get so damn hyped
On the mic, 'cause every time I step to the forefront I like
To wonder on to something that I'm drawn to
Every time I grab the mic and pass it to Sean he
Gets so deaf but I'm not gonna pass it yet
'Cause I burn like acid vet, word!
I'm a stick like a trident 'cause you need guidance



[Verse 1]
Once again, it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command ya to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

[Verse 2]
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling "Rosie, won't you come out to play?"
And no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events  that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then



Due to a massive amount of bootlegging
And constant downloading
People are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work
They are just continuing to get songs for free
See, what they do is buy computers, strictly pick songs that they like
And burn them on CDs or put them on iPods
Causing major decrease in sound scan, putting music retail in a tremendous slump
Causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales
Being forced to tour, causing more stress, more arguments with my wife
Not being able to see my kids, drink more, take more pills
Punch more people in the face, hate the world, and end up in rehab!
(sigh) This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers
Not that I wouldn't have done the same thing if I could get music for free when I was a kid
But now that I rap for a living, buy my goddamn CDs!
But in the meantime, buy this Obie Trice bootleg from DJ Whoo Kid
And put more money in his pocket
Thanks!



[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)



[Produced by Eminem and Luis Resto]

[Intro]
Woo! Geah, geah (Young) geah
Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down
I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 1]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like, "Damn, that man's face is just like my face"
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 2]
Music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell "holla"
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since (wooo!)
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 3]
My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
‘Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, ‘cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab
What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths



[Verse 1 : Lil Wayne]

Fix, Nigga

Change mind sporadically, same time compatibly
Wayne Carter, graduate, bang bang academy
Change my reality, thank God for grabbin' me
Sort of like him, cause they can't stop the wrath of me
But, Hell have no fury, Neither I
I would walk up in the Devil's Kitchen, eat a pie
Greedy eye, never full, getting fat
And bitch I got an itch, so don't let me catch you with the scra-scra-
Scratch y'all niggas off the face of the Earth
Even Mase came back for the money outta church
So with that on my mission for that money, I'mma work
My divine intervention might be in that woman's purse
Tryna find a better system, but I'm running out of perks
Baby daughter tummy irks, then daddy heart hurts
So daddy pop at 'em until they heart burst
For my baby girl candy I make her starburst
9/11 was a fucking shame, I done saw worse like
What if that bullet would have hit my heart first
Life, would it be different, I be still fuckin' 'round with death
Cause I got shot after that, and after that I grab the empty case
And then tried to throw that bitch back at they faces, Cita I made it
My nigga Real was on the ground like "naw", I got up and looked around, and grabbed the spot like "ahhh..."
I"m hard to kill, hardy har, cut the music back up and keep the party goin'
Fuck 'em, and I don't need no crease, I'm a motherfucking gangster off Eagle Street
I don't need the Hot Boys, I still keep my heat
And I ain't gotta squad up, I still keep my feet
They call me Michelangelo, you paint them so street
But you remove that wallpaper, bet that sheet-rock weak, (haha)
And you and I know what's goin' on, you probably riding to a different song
I'm probably riding on some different chrome, I'm probably high in a different zone
But when I'm off, we can get it on
I take no days off catch that shit for my friend
I clock out when I punch in, I'm shootin
Reel you ain't gotta block out, it's goin' in 'em
Them rats stop hatin' on the snake, the boy venom
The cat like Payton for the Lakers gon' win 'em
I'm certified stamp, I'm a champion
Like Buju Banton, I shoot you nine times like you was Fifty
But you won't be as likely as Fifty, I light me some Piffy
Light hella bright on the Infi, like what nigga, like me or lift me
I don't duck I be right in the city, for them bucks
I take me a flight, and come and get right, right in ya city
Yup, I'm just like Diddy, and nothing like Puff yeah
I'm something like city, he something like Young Wizzy
My Nike's is spiffy, I'm hardly a Gotti
I'm slightly a Nitti, all of a Carter
Bitch niggas never bitch me, bum niggas never ditch me
Shit I gotta get me, man I'm raw, slip me
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity, this moment of honesty
Ain't no more squad in me, unh



[Instrumental]

[Part 2: Benz Truck]

[Verse 3]
Aye
Yeah, I heard
They talkin' crazy on the block still
I ain't on the block no more, I'm in the hills
Just checked the temperature, I'm hot still
Ridin' 65, I'm on them hot wheels
The flow A1, I'm sauced up
I got my money right last year, I bossed up
Them diamonds, they look fake, they must ain't cost much
Fake friends, they gon' say we lost touch
Strangers, they gon' say I switched up
Broke niggas look at me like "Easy lick", yuh
Bad bitches want my kids, yup
Light skin, I call 'em my honey dip, yuh
Niggas waitin' on me to slip up
On my Blac Youngsta flex, thats how I feel, yuh
Lambo with the doors up, just for a feel-up
Pull up to the crib, jump inside the Benz truck

[Hook 2]
Aye, jump inside the Benz truck
I might sell the Lambo, buy a Benz truck
Or a SLS, gotta pick one
Get my bitch one
And she at the crib, yeah, doin' sit-ups
And she tryna get fit for a young nigga
She a down-ass bitch, that's why I fuck with her
I'm just tryna get rich, double up figures

[Outro]
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
She a down-ass bitch, that's why I fuck with her
She a down-ass bitch
Down, down, down, down, down



[Intro]
Ayo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit, they did it, ha ha

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, games over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Verse]
Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even got to say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
S'like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I can’t explain what it is my brain does
But however it works it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
It’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and 8 trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day, I’m anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs
When you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must of just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking, motherfucker, this ain’t drugs
You wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up
FUCK THAT! It’s too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off
I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must of been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I’ve always came off like Ja's chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don’t stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give y'all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain’t Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back I’ll be shooting more than just paintballs
Trust me

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, games over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Outro]
Fucking dummies
This ain’t chess
You playin' motherfucking checkers
This shit is all day man it’s too easy
We playing chess you playing checkers
You 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped
Fucking punks
And by the way
We ain’t just talking to one person
We talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play man
It’s all fucked up now
Fuck I’m suppose to do now?
Huh?!
What the fuck I'm suppose to do?!
Yo, we out!



[Intro: Roomie]
I'm friends with the monster that’s under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin’ your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Randler]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I’m gettin’ so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin’ to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Jonas Frisk + Martin Olsson]
I’m friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Jonas Frisk, Martin Olsson + Roomie]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Randler + Jonas Frisk]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge: Roomie + Martin Olsson]
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the monster
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Chorus: Roomie + Randler]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)



[Intro: Kids' voices + Eminem]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands
People!
One nation, under God, indivisible
It feels so good to be back!
With liberty and justice for all
Mosh with me now!

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, moving past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubberband Man – yeah, he just snaps back

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause, no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain – yeah, the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't
We're stronger now more than ever
They tell us "No!" we say "Yeah!" They tell us "Stop!" we say "Go!"
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush; fuck Bush!
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just—

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryin' to tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin', how could we allow
Somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists? Now
This is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six
-teen million people, all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress Daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles
To fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country
We're patronizin' a hero; look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why—‘cause I told you to fight!

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Outro]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President! Mr. Senator!

[Hailie Jade]
Can you guys hear us?



[Hook]
If you put your mouth on me
Ima put my mouth on you
Act like I’m a fool
Your call won’t come through

If you put your mouth on me
And on another dude
You really won’t know who
Actually loves you



[Male Medic]
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers!
Mr. Mathers...
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding
I'm gonna need an 18 gauge, left AC, right away

[Female Medic]
Uh, BP is 90 over palp, respiration's at 8
Okay, I'm tubing him

[Male Medic]
DMC, this is medic 41

[Voice over radio]
Medic 41, this is DMC base, MIC. I'm Betty, go ahead

[Female Medic]
He's cold, spike a bag and grab the backboard

[Male Medic]
Okay, got it; on 3... 1, 2
Let's move



[Hook: sample of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen]
Momma, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Momma, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

[Ca$his]
Geah, it's Ca$his, Shady Records
Real music, not fool music

[Verse 1]
There was just - a lot tears shed over what you been through
A mother's pain pays, for what her kid do
As Brian light fades, in the rearview
You enslaved to her, but gotta skid through
We was both bangin, Brian and I
Different neighborhoods so we chose different sides
Confrontaton in the street, so we had to ride
I won the fight, his pride felt I had to die
He screamed 1-8-7; I say, "I never hide"
You know where I'm at boy, I ain't hard to find
A couple weeks went by, we passin time
He seen me in the alley with his niggas, I
Was just dealin off Cavi then I seen the .9
Then I, heard a shot, he just kept firin
I started runnin, duckin, now I'm hidin
The whole time conscious of my own homicide and
I got away, click-click in the nick of time
His clip dropped down, he start signifyin
"You a bitch Ca$h, run with your bitch ass"
Heard sirens, then I heard him hit the gas
Right then, I knew your son wouldn't last
I said to myself, "Folk, I gotta kill his ass"
Roll through my apartment, hit the buildin fast
Gun out of my closet, hit the stick and dash
Put the, strap in my pocket, on my mission I saw him
Down the block sittin back, sippin 'gnac
I walked up like, "What's the business fam?"
He stared death in the eyes, then he shook his head
The broad he was with, shook as fuck
Put the barrel to his head, buck buck buck!
He fell to the ground, grass covered with blood
I probably go to hell for what I did to your son
I walked off slowly bugged, I ain't run
It's been five years, and no it's never over
He left me no choice, I offer you closure...
He left me no choice, I offer you closure

[Hook]

[Hook 2X: Ca$his - overlapping Hook]
Dear Ms. Jenkins, I send you my love
Hi, I'm Ca$his, I murdered your son
I'm closin the chapter, on what has begun
Dear Ms. Jenkins, I murdered your son

[Verse 2]
Dear momma, if you gettin this letter
I'm dead, I'm sorry if you gettin this letter
Wait - I'm sorry I ain't live a lil' better
My own selfish will wouldn't send you this letter
See - I had my hat cocked on the wrong spot
I threw the right sign up, on the wrong block
Blaow, blaow, bloaw! Ramone shot
Fuck a Ca$his momma! Ramone shot
It started as a fight, on a distant night
But far off the homicide, pistols tight
We still... grieve over your brother
Now you, grieve over your son - what the fuck?
He squabbed me up, this my hood
Some nigga named Ca$his from Chris' hood
He supposed to come back with iron, I ain't scared
Yes I am momma, I don't wanna be dead
But I can't run; too late, to try and change it
Born as your son but dyin as a banger
When my name gets discussed for entertainment
Never share this letter with a stranger
Please, please

[Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3]
Dear Brian, it's Ca$his, I can't sleep
I had to bang you, before you bang me
Just like I blame you, you could blame me
We both gave up our lives for banging (yeah)
We didn't know each other but we share the same hate
Your death is my life, so we share the same fate
This ain't what bangin was for, killin for nothin
Your death gave karma for the death of my woman (Monique!)
I'm tryin to make amends cause within I'm croak
But outside I'm hard, my friends don't know
I'm sorry that I killed you, I know it don't mean shit
We both could've stopped it, if we only seen shit
Happens for a reason we don't even know it
When you leave here, do you know where you goin?
I'm sendin my apologies through a song
Maybe we can reconcile when I'm gone

[Hook] + [Hook]



[Intro: Bizarre]
Detroit, Motown
Hey, guess what
They gave us a Super Bowl this year
And you know what happened?

[Hook]
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Hennyed up, remied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickie outfit, passenger side (Pistol grippin' punk)
Fuck it I just did two lines
A chrome Tec-9, it'll tear out nigga's spine
It's a party, go on in an have fun
Cause after it's over all you going hear is (RUN, NIGGA, RUN! AHH!!!) *gunshots*
Shooting, blasting, hitting the floor
$10,000 in the safe, shit, I'm about to score
Cause I'm dangerous off angel dust
Shit, I'll bust, even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my niggas that be robbing and stealing
Carjacking, murder one's and fucking drug dealings

[Hook]
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I stumble in the club blowed, 9mm cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it, I don't see the cops
Niggas don't believe it till they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Begging me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that mink
Come out of them diamonds, and you come out of that valuer
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back it up, shit, I can use it
I need the noise, in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icy chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that buttersoft, and since you buying out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow (Good looking)
I'm out for the paper, my homie, better hide your jewels
I'm in the game starving and I ain't playing by the rules, nigga

[Hook]
Robbing, shootin, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)

It's "The Re-Up"



[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"

"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face: "Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, "Fuck it—mug her while you're there," jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', "truce-truce!"(Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]

[Eminem]
Ayo Fif, I was thinking
You should go back to doing the shit you used to do

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Murder them, murder them, if I let them demonstrate I murder them
Niggas be fronting, word up it's stunting til they heard up
Their semi talk, I let that buck, I had these niggas running hard
I pull a nigga skirt up, and have him kicking dirt up
I get a nigga hit a nigga, back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrants
Seein' through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand close to the homie you wanna die with
Flames come out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
I'm talking like the feds ain't listening
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishing in
I get it nigga if you want it
Better ask niggas out me I be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot, out the cannon

[Hook: 50 Cent]
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to back put the work in
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to backroom workin'

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
You know I got the strap on me, bar holding that for me
I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though
100 9 millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggas drop like domino
Run for your life puta, si, vamonos
I was taught to see my crew a long time ago
Walk around with cocaine, yeah even my mama know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Made 4 hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cindy Lauper bitch, time after time
A nigga shine, like a nickel 9
I been talking to the man in the mirror
Nigga so ass, they be shaking like Shakira
It seems like my vision's getting clearer
See me coming with the hammer out, death is getting near you
It's funny how niggas never hear you
Till you run down on them, gun down on them

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, starting to feel like the old me



[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

[Verse 1]
You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 3]
I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like "Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula"
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?



[Intro]
Yeah, ohh, yeah yeah, ohh
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me (High!)
I said, I smell something in the air that's making me high

[Verse 1]
Okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe comes with six-pack with Exacto
Knives, strangling wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Your dreams are getting fulfilled
Ooh, I'm literally getting a chill, spitting at will
Me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're looking sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know
Who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods
Where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in
How they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fucking night's just begun

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum
Make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer
So unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur–
–prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (high)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind



[Intro]
Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said."
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 2]
Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, "Ni—"
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
"Ga-hu" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', "I'm gon—nuh cum!"
And this was supposed to be...

[Chorus]
...my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka (*burp*)



IN PROGRESS



[Eminem]
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
You'll never touch my

[Hook: Eminem]
Catch me if you can but you ain't man enough
You're standing tough
But you know that no matter what
You'll never get the chance to touch
My ballz, ballz, ballz
Ballz, ballz, ballz
You'll never touch my ballz

[Swift]
I see you ain't a player, you ain't balling
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talking
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is "get your man up off him!"
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talking
And I ain't gotta prove you nothing
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons

[Bizarre]
This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit (MARSHALL!)
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doing this for years, my team we can't lose (D12!)
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me a guard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this ball, you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm folding
Damn it, caught holding

[Hook]

[Eminem]
Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole, son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek?
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut, hurry up
I'm reaching up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus, he hikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah, so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disregard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
Our own 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball
To the sideline to Von, he steps out of bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god dang high that he trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put, put.. *mumbles*
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'mma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughing now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
We're never gonna make it, wait, I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'mma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on
Ass out with a flopping schlong, touchdown! Yeah, I told you
It's the longest yard

[Hook]

[Kuniva]
The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball
I'mma run through all of yall, yall just soft
Even though my cleats is kicking up mud
It's more traction for me, I'm stiff arming punks
High stepping through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playing ball with killers, my team's the realest
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best running backs there never was
Moving like Barry Sanders, leaving you in the dust

[Proof]
Yak is high, I got the highest yak
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snap like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eying my eye, a Mack truck trying to sack us
No matter how big they flying backwards
Wide receiver receiving wide
For every stride in my life, yo, I breathe and die

[Kon Artis]
Defense is playing a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams (blue 43)
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excel
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flying through the air like a superhero
They can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For being the best player on my team, what?
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone (touchdown!)
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

[Hook]

[Eminem]
Footballs
I'm talking about footballs, dude



[Intro: Eminem]
I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm like the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because…

[Hook: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup? Ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby"
They're all like, "Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please Marshall, please, let me suck your cock"
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a cappellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude! I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these…

[Hook: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Post-Hook: Eminem & Swifty McVay]
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band, my band!
Alright, okay, alright, give the mic man, okay dawg, gi—come on
Dude!
Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay (& Kon Artis)]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (Oh, I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap, it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, and (Eminem)]
Look at Em's little punk ass thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
(No, I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck, man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up and his always sound best!
You know what, man? I'ma say something
Ayo Em! (You got somethin' to say?!) Man, nothin'!
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up!
You ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

[Hook: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof and (Eminem)]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo, it's…) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey, dude, I love your band!)
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
(Proof, carry my bag!) Bitch, carry your own!
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis slipped me some crack
"Lose Yourself" video – I was in the back
"Superman" video – I was in the back
For the media I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall! Ask us the questions!
Like "Who's D12? How we get started?"
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?!
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12! I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem]
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name
(Man, fuck this!) [punch]

[Hook: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (Ha-ha!)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall!)
‘Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the [mumbles] (Ha-ha-ha!)

[Post-Hook: Eminem (Bizarre)]
My band, my band (your band, our band)
My band, my band (your band)
My band, my band (your band)
My band, my band, my band! (Roxanne Shanté, lesbian)
(Yeah, hey y'all, the hardest boy band in the world – D12!)

[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called "My Salsa"
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
Where'd everybody go?



[Intro - soundclips from "Scarface"]

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Everywhere I go, I gotta tag along
'Cause my buzz getting strong and they mad I'm on
He ride with me when I pass the mall
And wait for me on the bench when I run a game of basketball
One squeeze'll make a bastard fall, gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest, mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam
'Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home
My hand bling full of platinum to shine his chrome
He even got closet space inside my home
He ain't never been broke, he glitchless
He's so reliable, I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam and a scope for distance
The best company when approaching business
He will ride with me 'til the end
We all got a friend and mine is a G-U-N

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My buddy got a temper, he dying to pop off
Last time he did the cops had the block all locked off
Take him with me to hustle, stashed him in a trashcan
My fingertips soft, for 4 hours I bag grams
You meet him, your destination's hell or heaven
'Cause I only bring him out for that 187
He don't have a heart, I just keep feeding him shells
He get it popping in the hood, so his name rings bells
Ms. Jones stay on the 3rd floor, she called the cops on me
They came, I ran, I had to toss my other little homie
Niggas know I got new friends so they stay in their place, kid
I stay screaming on niggas and beating up base heads
These niggas ain't thorough, they just like to pretend
Keep fucking 'round they gon' say hello to my little friend

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
We been through it all but yet we both still living
We been in a box but we both still spitting
And when there was beef, you even played your position
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
At first they wouldn't listen 'til they heard you go off
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
And little did they know that we was ready for war
Bet the nigga wish he never stuck his head out the door
See whenever you come out, something happen on the block
You the reason that nigga done stopped rapping like Pac
People see you and run, and you ain't even say shit
They just know you ain't nothing to play with
You stay with sixteen homies, and one in the hole
When the first one get out, the next one go
To know where you headed, you got to know where you been
The Glock stay with me, we friends 'til the end

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

[Outro - "Scarface" clip]

{*Gunshots*}



[Verse 1 : Jadakiss]

I don't take a lot of advice
My lifestyle's product and dice
And guns that'll target your pipe
It's sort of life approaching the don
Wrong word, wrong vibe
Four-five will leave most of you harmed
Move coke through the ocean
Paid off the coast guard
Sailed out to Cuba made dure shit's potent
Violence with caution
And ain't too many niggas you know
That got polished transporting
Egg-nog whip, four door Ferrari
Two M16's, I beg ya'll flip
I'm the hardest nigga you know
Check it out, turned forty keys to eighty
When I get in the dough
So I flash like cameras, blast like hammers
I worry 'bout you lil niggas just like your grandmas
Get shit jumping like the play offs
Every twenty minutes a day
Give or take, I knock a K off
Been in the hood for real long
Catch me anywhere and I got a half a mil on
Jada, kiss you now, you die now
Why later? Double R and D-Block

[Verse 2 : Sheek Louch]

All these sweet ass niggas give me space
Basic look, something light but I'm heavy at chase
Let the nine blow out your face
Better hope I roll 4,5,6, cause it's on if I ace
Motherfuckers ain't hard, you pussy god
I treat the whole New York like the yard
Stick to myself, nigga front, Sheek pulling his card
I don't think these niggas got brains
Knowing that I'm working with, ahh, little bit of change
And will hop out the drivers side of the Range
And shoot all around like a young Dan Ainge
Sheek get it popping like a dope head's veins
With two dancers with me but not like Kane's
You as fake as these T.V. shows
I ain't watching but I know how the ending goes
Mad holes through the side of your Benz
Everybody running off, nothing like the finale of Friends
You talk greezy but it's only talk
You don't mean no harm like George do Weezie
When Sheek have beef it's like Dre and Eazy
Big and Pac, somebody better leave me
It's D-Block, celebrate nigga
Everything cool, I got my smoke and lil bit of liquor



[Intro: Mark Avery]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Alright stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mothafuckin' conscience!

[Eminem]
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!

[Eminem]
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

[Dr. Dre]
Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)

[Hook]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie, Kids?)
No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck?)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathing
(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating
While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

[Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?



*Television static*
*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*

[Speech: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Ha-ha!
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me:
"Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!"
Uh… Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Crazy
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha
You're funny, Daddy!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, look
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‘Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So b-b-b-b-b-b, but I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: "Come nearer!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here!
Talk to me, sit! Here, pull up a chair!
Why don't you cut your hair?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dye it back, come on, try it!"
Ahh, no! I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you," — but I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother," — yeah, so what of her?
"You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes," — fuck you, motherfucker!
I had you beat! — "No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm taking it back," — you fuckin' bitch, why?!
"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
"Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!"
But I don't want it back — "Yes, you do," — no, I don't
"Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later," — no, I won't
"I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
"Well, I got him on the phone right now!"
(Slim!) You're lying! (Yo, Slim!) How, why now?
What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all that Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) — fuck this mirror!
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you," — fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
"Put the gun down!" — bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive, — "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall…" — What?! — "No one's gonna love you like I do."
*Chainsaw starting up*

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
(Sayin') I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body (your body, your body, your body, your body)



I don't know what point exactly it started to be a problem, I just remember liking it more and more, whenever people would try to help me I would say get that fucking person outta here, I can't believe they said that shit to me, they don't know anything about me or my life. It's not like I'm out here snorting coke or shooting heroin up my arm.

It's either you have a problem and can you control it or you can't, I literally thought I could control it until I overdosed during Christmas of 2007. Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died. My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn’t think I was gonna make it.

I remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where I was when I overdosed. I was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of Vicodin that I maybe hidden away and then I found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones.

After I got out of rehab I did not sleep for three week straights I mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute I would just sit up and stare at my TV.

I would walk around my house and thinking every single day, "I'm gonna fucking die." I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for them. I'm growing. I just couldn’t believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something

The doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin,
I was addicted Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I didn't even know what I was taking anymore. It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family, now that I understand that I’m an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it now.

I wanted to make an overall statement — I’m back. It was a slow process. You gotta remember I hadn’t recorded a song sober in seven years. So it took me a while to even feel like I could record a song sober … I don’t know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. It’s been years.

I almost feel like a little kid again with rap, I wanna play around with different flows. If I don’t feel like it’s what I’m fully capable of, if there’s one weak line, I wanna change it. Rap was my drug It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that. Now rap’s getting me high again.

So I would say to anybody, it does get better, you know. It just does.



[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?"
"It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad" (Sorry)
"Let's try another room"
"I don't trust you"
"Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods"
"Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab"
"Oh dag" (Mmm)
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"
"Huh?"

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 2]
"Yo, Sue"
"Get away from me, I don't know you"
"Oh shoot, she's trippin'"
"I need to go puke" (Blehh)
"I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)"
She said, "Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure"
I said, "I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me"
She said, "I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"
"(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate"

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 3]
"Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful"
"Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled"
"I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you"
"He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude"
"Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?"
"Well, it depends on how many you had"
"I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
"She's gonna die, dude"
"I know and it's my fault"
"Oh my God"

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Susan, please wake up, please
Please wake up, what are you doing?!
You're not dead, you're not dead
I know you're not dead
Wake up, Susan, wake up
Oh my God

Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 2: Eminem]
While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking shed, sharpening my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti
Or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginning
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending!
He'll rip your vocal chords out
And have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em
Then plug them motherfuckers-in-each one of your eye sockets
‘Cause I thought you might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up! You’re gonna end up regretting
You ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinking about just saying
"Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!"
‘Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But everytime I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again (shh, shh, shh, shh)
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3AM in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's never gonna end
Now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'

[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try



[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Ay, S-L-A, U-G-H, T-E-R, H-O-U-S-E
Yes we are, the best in the biz, the West in the bitch, this East side LB
Money over coochie, mayne, 645 when dip through the burbs
I be on my Gucci Mane, smash on the gas, kick a bitch to the curb
House in the hills, thousands and mill's
Getting wild in the field with your spouse in Brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel?
To count dollar bills that I piled off skills
Check it out, Jets fly private
Nigga S5 Hybrid, baby test drive my whip
I’m in Bed Stuy with my chick
On my West side fly shit
Pulling out minks when the weather get chilly
Left Eye side kick
Now don’t you niggas go chasing waterfalls
These bitches wall to wall and they love them Slaughter's y'all

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my motherfucking life
My life, oh yeah
This is my motherfucking life
(Jets fly private, Nigga S5 Hybrid, Baby test drive my whip)

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Sometimes I look around and I just, I just can’t believe it
I’m on a high like a falsetto, maybe that’s why I feel like I’m dreaming
My eyes just quit, look what I’m seeing
My life just shifted, I feel like I’m breathing
Light that spliff
Nah, I don’t even smoke cause it burn my throat but tonight I’m steaming
Patron in my cup, holding mine up
Toasting with a slut, that I know I'm gon' fuck
In these five star sheets, put her right to sleep, then kick the bitch out when I wake up
Even though baby girl got a large ol' ass
I remember praying that my cargo's last
Now my car so fast, I don't think you understand in a Murcielago dash
When it hurts but you ride through the dirt, and you work till it hurt, and you end up on Marshall’s staff
Hoping that your granny get to see you at the Grammy’s, get a call from your family that your grandma passed
Then you know what you promised her
So you stay hot as a, thermometer, dipped in lava
So proud to be part of a, conglomerate, like this

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah

[Bridge: Cee-Lo]
Every time that they play this
Put your hands up high if
You're happy you made it
It's bittersweet when I say it
But since I'm alive, might as well celebrate

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
What a success story, when the film plays it gets less gory
My son didn’t know who his pop was for years, now it's less Maury
God put it there as a test for me
Used to walk around with the vest and 40
Cops tryna mess hall me
Now babes with the 34F’s adore me
I took the rock and a hard place and made the best orgy
Now the fans approach, I get paranoid
Where I’m from, they tell me never let your guard rest
But it’s simple to disregard stress
Hoes run to the bone and it ain’t farfetched

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
Now jets fly high shit
That Panamera Porsche that’s Ryan’s fly whip
As a kid I was poor, playing tag, now I’m it!
For those of yall that don’t remember me
I’m a Detroit Oak Parker
Went from no office to offers
I told ya’ll I would get my daddy out the post office
And so far I don’t really need to own my city
Just as long as the D is on my fitted
My sons and my daughter and my wife is along for the ride
This is the motherfucking life

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah



The shuffle goes on, now it's My Life by Eminem, 50 and Adam

A guitar riff introduces the song, a little beat comes on
Adam sings the chorus saying maybe his life might be against him
He feels like running away. Without a place to go
Confused, disillusioned, like this is some sick plot from a director that hates him

50 then relates his life lessons saying how he came from nothing and how he regretted helping other people sometimes because they are ungrateful, so he decides to keep his 50 cents to himself instead of helping others because he could instead be an entrepreneur and start a business or something he doesn't need to be anyone's savior

Eminem says he's getting ready for war, training or something
Sharpening his machete. He doesn't fool me, he only says it's lyrically to avoid all the prosecution from lawyers and whatever
He knows the world is against him, he feels it under his skin, so he prepares for the time his fate goes against him. Wishes he could somehow open your eyes to the truth

50 again says that was a good thing. Waking up from the neediness and accepting some of the hate and use it as a motivation to get stronger. It doesn't do any good to just wallow in self pity, you gotta improve despite the bad circumstances



[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay
Alright, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight
Yo, yo
Alright, I'mma lay the chorus first
Here we go now

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Verse 1]
My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearing 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
"What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fucking seat for?"
"Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffing ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleeping
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fucking face without even tasting it
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid"

[Bridge 1]
My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on

[Chorus]
'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Bridge 2]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh

[Verse 3]
Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happening
A tragedy, the fucking past ended up catching me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
"Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"
But I don't need it "Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up"
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Outro]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though
Dr. Dre, 2010
Ay, this shit is hella hard, homie
Yo, take us on outta here
Woo!



[Intro: Eminem]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
What up X

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the Can like Bis cop over me
To do war and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pulling two gats out
With bullets, I finally got something to shoot at now

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
And make ends meet
Now was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse
I follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree
So now ...

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Why do you hate me ?
I came from nothing, blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit, I struggle for survival
And now you trying to act like my rival
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life, nigga, it's not worth
All the pain (all the pain), all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horror), all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the fuck you think you talking to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I could have been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels
I could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I Square Dance cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, steady trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better trying to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about, c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I shit across your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
(X) Pass me the weed, I'mma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time, man (Watch your fucking mouth)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Outro: Eminem]
For the last time, man, I'm through

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Wanna see my stick five kids in my eyelids? (What the fu--)
Wanna kids me and do exactly like I did? (Uh, hell nah!)
Try kid and get f----- up worse that my life kid? (Yes!)
I have a heavy weight, I'm tryin' to get my heavy weight
But I can't figure out which lice girl I want to get heavy weight 💪
And Dr. Gay said, "Slim Shady you are racist!" Uh-uh!
"So why you racist? Man, you racist!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm age twelve
'Cause I hung my age twelve from the top bunk with age twelve
Got pissed off and ripped age twelve (what the fu--)
And smacked @#4 so hard I knocked *** clothes backwards like age twelve
I ate a fat pound of ass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat ass
Who sat down too ass
C'mere ass! (Jeff, wait a minute, that's my food, dog!)
I don't give a food dog, God sent me to eat the world's co()!

My English teacher wanted to f--- me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I f--- in Junior High
I smacked him in the face 'cause he was racist
Chased him with a paper
Stapled his paper to a piece of paper
Walked into a paper club, had my paper stripped off
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my paper in a paper
Extradumbass, running over lesbians in a space ship
While they're screaming "Les just bi-ans"
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Holy shit! (Eminem explodes)



[Intro]
Wooh!
Alright, alright
Now listen, listen loud and clear, you dig?
This is uh, this is history
For real nigga
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Now check me out, listen

[Verse 1]
Why everybody change on me?
While I remain the same, that's why I'm bringing Major Payne
Like mothafuckin' Damon Wayans
And now you chickens is toast, this ain't Raising Cane's
It's clear we wasn't raised the same, rappers lame with fame
I'm known to kill a wack rapper like a bad hobby
I smash hotties and stash bodies, then cop lil' boats
Like that's Yachty, and that's probably
Why I'm so fly that I crash lobbies and after it slap thotties
I'm a rap fanatic who rap fantastic without the platinum status
Why I'm blastin' the maddest 'cause most of these cats is average (uh)
I swear to God that I never lie to avoid a fact
A terrible hair stylist, I'm destroying tracks
I don’t bust guns but my niggas deploy the strap
Then bring out a fucking .45 like Michael Jordan's back
I wanna give these niggas hell if heaven was grant
The best thing from PG since Kevin Durant

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is, yeah
Oh yeah, YBN shit
Don't doubt my name, I said, I tell 'em what my name
Nigga better know the name, yeah, YBN shit
Better know, my name is (yuh)

[Verse 2]
See, a nigga was skippin' class, damn I rather attempt the raps
Said fuck it I'm missing that, when I blow go tick for tack
I'm a boss on my Diddy shit, my flow is too hideous
Dropped out of school, senior year, a true idiot
You see, I wear designer bags, I don't carry minor cash
I'm trying to find the stack, big as Blac Chyna's ass
Oh you wack rhymers, trash climbers, that's kinda sad
In the pathfinder, but my path couldn't find my dad
Now my soul dented, pulled up in a Ghost tinted
In a drive-by, where niggas shooting shit like Cole Bennett
You ho's finished, in this rap shit a cold menace
But I'm flowin' gold liquid, damn I'm so vicious
Uh, my name is Cordae, but don't forget the YBN
I used to get high with friends off grandmama's vicodins
And mix it with a percocet, damn that really worked a sweat
My verse is just perfect, yeah, fuck it go and search the net

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is
Nigga's be the lamest, YBN shit
My name, you nigga's know his name
The nigga's flow is lame, nigga, hah

[Outro]
Man, these niggas whack as fuck in this music shit, bro, like what the fuck
You niggas suck like shit bro, like damn you niggas fucking suck
Man

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (OW!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians
While they're screaming, "Let's just be friends!"
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh hey, thanks)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude,can you sign that)
So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away!(Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too are hairy to hide(Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
"How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!"
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steaming mad,and by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

[Verse 1]
Hi, kids! Do you like Primus? (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Wanna see me stick 9 inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try *** and get messed up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said "Slim Shady, you a ***head!"
Uh-uh! "So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like a caged elf
Who stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off
Kissed 'em and said "I ain't know silicone was supposed to be this soft!"
I'm about to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
Faster than the fat man who sat down too fast
Come here, lady! "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Damn)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler, and told him to change the grade on the paper (Now!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more *** than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing *** and name it after her (Here mom!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans

Hi kids, do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?

My brain's dead weight
I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
"Slim Shady, you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh!
"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut
"Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"

Where'd everybody go?



Want some water?
No, I think I'm okay
Rainshine

I don't care how sick you say it's gonna get
My big ass bubble has not busted yet
Because I feel
I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes I feel
I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes I feel, I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes I feel, I feel fine

New time again, dis a new time again
For de time now, de dodge a man him come through and then
Me no want no war, me say between no man
'Cause this hear time dodge a no work for satan
Lord have mercy
Lord have his mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have his mercy

You know what?
I've got nothing to complain about
My breath is bad
But my beer is stout
So take my hand and let us jump about
'Cause we got nothing to complain about
The sky is grey
I think it's gonna rain
But that's okay
'Cause hell, I like the rain
So join me here in this here refrain
And shut your shit
And don't complain
What?
'Cause we got nothing to complain about
And you got nothing to complain about
So c'mon
It ain't that difficult to figure out
That we've got nothing to complain about
So c'mon

A man a shot upon him, life through the dark
When you check it out, it's a natural fact
Jah jah have good judgement when you do all you want
And if...

You can speak of babylon while you're around me
'Cause every single little thing I see astounds me
Rainshine...

Inna this time, me no fight 'gainst no man
Me no want no man come try to test dodge
'Cause when you check it out and go upon one mission
And God and the Father and me inspiration
Me test upon a mission and a one-way plan
Me no want no man try disrespect me fashion
'Cause when you check it out and put inspiration
And that is how a you go reach Mount Zion

I feel magical, mystical, motherful, logistical

Lord have his mercy

Magical, mystical, motherful, logistical
Magical, mystical
Magical
Magical, mystical

Look around X3
On the ground X2
There's a finger on my blister



[50 Cent]
You ready? Okay let me wind you up
Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These niggas is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he move like that
That's my muh'fuckin toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gon' pop that gat
You don't wanna play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fuckin with my toy soldier
If youse a casualty of war, trust me I got more
You don't want it with my toy soldiers

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience no morals or nothin
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggas hatin on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggas fo' sho' man, hold me down

[Hook]

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker
If you ain't 'bout it I don't want you around, cocksucker
Every word out my mouth is felt; that oo-wop pop
Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt - I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down - and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa, hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Two windows to a man's soul
... fill you with holes
Listen homey.. I'm the man for the job
So if he ain't.. (Yayo, c'mon!)

[Verse Three: Tony Yayo]
I'm in that two-door Phantom and the body's kitted
Waves in my head lookin like tsunami hit it
Niggas scheme, but the infrared beam's on the mack
I'll put green on yo' head like an Oakland A's hat
One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin for his enemies
Ridin gassed up, off double D batteries
His last casualties, is hooked to them IV's
(50 gimme the word) that's when I squeeze (yeah!)
Click-clack, take that, fall back
It's a contract, 50 grand, I'm 50 man

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Yeah! This is the general speakin (yeah)
When I say move (ha ha ha) nigga you better move
Soldier, ha ha
I don't want nobody talkin to none of my niggas
Come around here with that bullshit
Tryin to feed niggas bad information and shit
That's how my toys malfunction



[Intro]
This motherfucker, man!
Just won't shut up, will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me!
I'm promotin' you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in this coffin!

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Verse]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An 83-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Please don't—you'll probably fall with me
And our asses'll both be history
But then again you'd finally get your wish
‘Cause you'll be all over the street, like 50 Cent
Fuckin' punk pussy! Fuck you, chump!
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you—we hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got two cases and probation—fight me!
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists
Right in front of the only thing that you have in this world
A little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots
Where you the only white boy up in that bitch just rippin'?
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's
Just makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like
You're half white; Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down!
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' head—go ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
‘Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich
Life's a bitch, ain't it? Raymond?
Here, let me break the shit down in layman's
Terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it and
Canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you
Here, let me slow it down for you
So that you could understand if I say it slower
Let it go, dog, it's over

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Outro]
Haha… talking 'bout I have motherfuckers callin' your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib!
You ain't even got a fuckin' phone… fuckin' bum!
Threatenin' to shut me down at your lil' fuckin' Source magazine, if I come back on you and attack you
Bitch, you attacked me first!
Take it like a man, and shut the fuck up!
And fuck your little magazine too!
I don't need your little fuckin' magazine
I got XXL's number anyways
And y'all can't stand it, ‘cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watchin' me
From whatever fuckin' TV you was watchin' me from
From Boston… the mean streets of Boston
Fuckin' sissy! And you got us scared up in here, motherfucker
Suck our motherfuckin' dicks!
Oh! And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted, y'all: The Source has a white owner!



[Verse 1: P!nk]
You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 2: P!nk & Eminem]
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I
Leave you for good and never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you—what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm—

[Chorus: P!nk]
I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me



[Intro: Eminem and Denaun Porter]
Denaun, what up, man?
What up, dawg?
You all right?
Chillin', cold as hell
Yes, it is. Hey, bus didn't come here, didn't he?
No. Hey look, you got 15 cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store. Alright, man?
Quick, ‘cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know. You know what? Ayy look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car. You know what I'm sayin'?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

[Interlude: Eminem and Denaun]
Em: You know what I'm sayin'? See what I'm talkin' about, man? ‘Cause that's it. Yeah.
A million dollars ain't even that far away, man.
De: Yo, we got to get the money, man!
I can't be broke for the rest of my life!
Em: Yeah, I hear what your sayin'. Look, there's got to be somethin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
De: I can't live like this for the rest of my life, man.
Bummin' rides everywhere I go.
Em: Yeah, what's up with Lexus's and Land Cruisers?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just
Choose the few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

[Outro: Eminem and Denaun]
Em: That's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm not tryna be the player, I'm tryna be the mayor.
I want to be president.
De: Yo, forgot that president, man.
I'm tryna be king, makin' dead presidents.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Gettin' money any time I want, ownin' my own businesses and all that. You know what I'm sayin'?
Em: Yeah, I'm tryna be a millionaire, man.
De: Hahaha, but don't all, you know?
You only live once, '96, baby



[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy – you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough



[Verse 1]
Yes I understand I done came a long way
From huggin them corners to appearin on TV
From choppin up nicks like this here feeds me
To makin 'em hits like this shit's easy
But it's not, it's a whole lot of bullshit involved
And truthfully, I'd rather be bullshittin with y'all
But I gotta chase the donuts, Cocoa's growin
And it's like "Oh shit, she was just born"
And now she knowin every song on the radio
If I hear another Bow Wow quotable (Oh no)
Grown as ever, school craft for ever
Recognize real when I stare at ya, my niggas
I'm a hold you down, even when I'm not around
I'm just gone for now, I'll be back in a while
Back in a while, yes (Said I'll be back in a while)

[Hook]
My niggas Koon and G, never forget ya
John Doe, I will never forget ya
Jo Jo, I will never forget ya
P-Funk, how could I ever forget ya?
Terry T, I will never forget ya
My man B, I will never forget ya
Strafmoore, Obie will never forget ya
Lauda, how could I ever forget ya?

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to my chick friends
Never stuck in my dick in friends, just my down ass bitches
You know who you is like you know how
To get a sucker mothafucka's riches, y'all ain't shit
And when I touch back home, nigga, find me a bitch
With a fat ass, and no I ain't down to trick
That's asinine, I'm on the grind and I'm tryin to get rich
All this a mine so y'all got some, get your wigs did
My ridettes from East to West
North to South, stab a bitch for runnin her mouth
Five rugrats, big gun in the house, you run up in
You get stretched up out without a doubt, it's vicious
This go out to all my tataliciouses
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about

[Hook]
Big homie Creda baby, never forget ya
Little Meeko, never forget ya
My sister Zata, never forget ya
Nikki, I will never forget ya
Nigga Cat, how could I ever forget ya?
Jim Brown, I will never forget ya
Young Bratty, how could I ever forget ya?
Keena Johnson, I will never forget ya

[Verse 3]
And now that the album is sold, the story unfolds
Cause I'm probably asleep on your living room flo'
Whether gold or plat, O. Trice
Always knows to go back, pass the Carnac
Crash the Cadillac, nigga ain't shit changed
Just a lot a change, a whole lot a brain
A whole lot a dates, a whole lot a thang
But hey I'm from the D, I got a whole lot a game
And I promise, I'm as thorough as you made me
Detroit living, I'm in thoroughly with Shady
I make moves 'til them fools come engrave me
They crazy, the pistol was cocked, he won't play me, yeah

[Hook]
Rest in peace my nigga Lou Green, I will never forget ya
Little Randy, I will never forget ya
Keith, I will never forget ya
Shawn Stringer, I will never forget ya
Little Randy, how could I ever forget ya?
My nigga Shan, never forget ya
All my niggas that's gone, never forget ya
I love ya'll, it's on never forget ya

[Outro]
Yeah, Shady baby! Detroit motherfuckers (313 baby)
That's right, we in here, know what I mean? (Never forget ya)
I've been seein the struggle my nigga
I'm rest to go, the color ain't purple, the color is green
Let's get this money, Hop-o, yeah, momma, right here



[Intro]
It don’t take much strength to pull a trigger
But try to get up every morning day after day and work for a living
Let’s see ‘em try that
Then we’ll see who’s the real tough guy
The working man is a tough guy

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I woke up this morning thinking ’bout the old me
When I was feeling like Miller Lite and Ol' E
But now I ride on some conscious shit
I’m getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I could have a problem with is myself
That’s probably why my only competition is myself
From today to tomorrow the Doc is just rocking the same drum
Fuck the past, though I ain’t forgot where I came from
I got the club rocking, uh
I got your girl jocking, uh
Me and Fif’ still in this bitch, bitch
We goin' the distance witchu party people, come on

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ayy
It’s a new day
It’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now, you can get your knees on the church floor, pray it get﻿ better
Or push the dough on the liquor store, see where it get ya
But me, I got to be on top
I said, me I get to be on top
I got the street on lock
I’m on automatic pilot, ain't nobody stopping me
Growing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny
Niggas ride, I don’t hide, I dump to get 'em off of me
I’m a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I’m from the bottom
Soon as I spot ‘em I get to drop ‘em
I got ‘em; the competition, red-dot 'em
It’s dinner time when the 9 come out
It’s off with the chain, off with the ring
Move, bang, off with ya brain

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Marks on the wall
It’s now or never at all
I’m gonna give it my all
Whether I rise or fall

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
True story, I said I’d get rich or die trying
I did it, good luck sucker, trying to stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music, music my first love
We paper chasing -- I’m always coming in first, cuz
I’m built for it, see I’m better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I’m coming to get ya
I got to win, Em watch and Dre watch and my son watching
Fuck that, losing ain't an option
I’m sharp I’m on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
I’m back on my A-game
I’m focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that I’m stronger than an ox now mentally

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye



[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home, right?
RI-I-IGHT?! PSY-Y-YCH!

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man

[Verse 1: Jessie Reyez]
I hop in your whip and take a sip, then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin'
I'm bipolar with the switch-up just as quick like you cummin'
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin'

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be Rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & Eminem]
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home, right?
RI-I-IGHT?! PSY-Y-YCH!

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Reyez & Eminem]
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch
Suck my dick, (bi-) you fuckin' suck, man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck (Bi-)
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch

[Verse 3: Jessie Reyez]
I play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmine Coppola
You're tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola
Estás de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm an emotional wreck, weak (Uh-huh)
Everything over-affects me (Yeah)
When you joke, it upsets me (Yeah)
You say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy (Uh-huh)
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (Yep)
You hope I choke on a Pepsi (Yep)
Bitch, you was supposed to correct me! (Oh)
Been textin' you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch
I doubt that you're goin' to house sit
In that outfit, and those skin-tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say don't come over 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing, why
Don't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?



[Eminem & Prostitute]
(Hello)
Hi how you doing? (Okay)
Um, who is this? (This is Nicole, who's this?)
Yo this Marshall, how you doing?
(I'm okay honey, but I'm very busy)
(Did you wanna set up an appointment?)
Yeah I actually would, I would like to set up an appointment to get my dick rubbed
(Oh yeah?) Yeah... You know what I mean?
I'm just like... Yo, I'm kinda mellow
You know what I mean? My personality, I'm like real laid back
You know what I mean?
(Yeah, but listen baby why do you have to talk over the phone)
(Is that the only way you can get off?)
(Or do you wanna come in person?)
Uh, I wanna come in person (Okay baby) Alright...
(Why don't you be a man about it and set up an appointment?)
(What time would you like to come?)
Okay, well first of all bitch, you offended me by saying I, I should be a man about it
’Cause, yo I'm really, I'm really confident in my sexuality
(Okay, but you know what? A man would just call)
(I, I deal with men all day, they call)
(They call, they make an appointment, they come by)
(And then I deal with little wimps who just wanna get off over the phone)
Right, right, but I'm saying, what-what's you saying
Right I ain't trying to get off over the phone
I'm trying to set up an appointment like a man
(Okay, what time is good for you honey?)
I don't know, if we could do it, like, at 2 o'clock or something like that, you know what I mean?
(You call me when you know for sure baby, I'm very busy)
Alright, alright bitch I'mma call you in a minute, you know what I mean?
(Okay baby, go jerk off your little dick)
Alright bitch



Feat. B.I.G., Eminem

[Intro: 50 cent]
I love niggas! I love niggas!
Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!!)
I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again)
And to all niggas that do it I love

[B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (You niggas understand?!)
To all my Bronx (It's war nigga)
To all my Queensbridge (I'll blow you away)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's a real nigga for ya

[Chorus: 50 Cent] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the ruler

[Chorus] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hail the Henny
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people feel your awkward
I tame I'm not lame
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo punk ass off propa'
This new place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged you know, bump my shit, bitch!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] x2
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

[Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Twizzy's in this bitch with Obie Triiiiice
So watch what you say before you call our name
If you say one more thing, it won't be nice

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Here we go, I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jealous of us to love us
You ain't it, G-Unit made it
And Obie's comin, D-Twizzy's comin, you sick to your stomach
50% is 50-Cent, the other 50% is who's color skin it is
Well if you're even considering takin our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get too intricate into it
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cuz then it's gunna get to the point where it escalates
Into some other shit, then I'ma flip
Then I'm a get to stompin' in my Air Force One's
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
Thinkin' they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Ya'll tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have P!nk tickle me
Hickory dickory dock tickoty tock tickety
A little bit of the diggity doc diggity
Mixed with a little bit of the jigga jig jigga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity

[Chorus 2: Eminem] x2
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cuz we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records
We the label fa sho
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
We gon' fuck around and steal your people
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50
We gonna kill your fuckin label 4-sho
Shady in the place to be, see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic RIGHT!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cuz I'm off probation in less then 6 MONTHS!

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady Records
Still Aftermath
And don't think we don't hear you motherfuckers talking
Cuz we do
We see y'all
But we just gonna sit back for a minute
And watch what the fuck yall do



{"Niggas!"} Yeah.. uh..
{"Niggas!"}

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, I'd rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine 'cross the line
My two 9's go BIYA BIYA when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfuckers was crooked
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas
.. uhh, straight take his life
So don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em
Lickin off shots for Latasha, that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now?
I packed a 9 last year, in '99 I'm packing two now
And even if they pull they triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothing's gonna stop the plan of true niggas

[Hook]
{"Niggas!"} Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
{"Niggas!"} Yeah, niggas
Cause bein a nigga means you love niggas, haha
{"Niggas!"} I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do

[Jadakiss] HA!!! Uhh..
Aiyyo!

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em Bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is headshots
Your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?
Niggas nowadays they worry me
My bars is therapy, as long as you usin 'em thoroughly
Muah 'til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
And I'm a product of the 70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin wit'chu I'm probably beefin wit'chu
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin wit'chu
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin you keep it wit'chu
Cause unfortunately I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol
And know what the llama do
Shady/Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D Block, and of course Amaru
Lot of people honor you, probably cause the way
That you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But, anyway, life goes on
So I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do

[Hook]

{"Niggas!"} Nigga! Can't fuck with us



[Verse 1]
Well..
(HIGH TIMES) what I experience when I hit the blessin
(LIFE LINES) Cuz this is serious, we will kill your best friend
(WRITE RHYMES) like no other being, spit awkward morbid shit
(BRIGHT WHITE) Lights what you see, keep walkin towards it
(SHINE HEIGHT) Web Entertainment, I'm gon' get famous with a
(FINE LINE) from arrogance, David (?) forgot what's in this

(FIGHT MINE) Dumb bitch for repeatin the things that she did

GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY

[Verse 2]
Armed and dangerous, AKs turn your brains to mosh
Mix my weed with angel dust, feds label us notorious
Van Dyke nigga that love to bust. You laid to us
That nigga thats baggin and tacklin
Coming with strings and violins
That violent shit
On them beds we lyin in
We like to sin
High off speed and nitrogen
So much dope, it's toxic shit
You try to go to sleep - oh not again
I wouldn't snooze if I was you
You know what Gordy gon do to you
King of these dreams since '92
Look at all the hell I've took him through
Can't lay down cause you know who
Comes right in and haunting you
Really wanna know what death like? Well, I'm the nigga to fuck wit
You niggas can't bust clips (cuz) me and Fat Killahz love the dumb shit
Fuck the dumb shit, get the 'K
All the intentions to hit your face
Hit your waist, grab your shit
Peel this gat, spatter quick
I don't think you wanna fight, son
Blood will spill all of the night, punk

[Verse 4]
You can't stay awake. You hate the way you think
You blaze and blaze for days
You contemplating ways to put 38s to brains
Look who I made insane. Move and I break you frame
I'm gruesome with hand grenades
You choose to shoot thangs and thangs
We lootin you, take your chain
We touch you with crazy gangs
We'll do you like candid AIDs
We'll screw you till man it's made
Do you till man has sprayed
We stupid with foolish face
Illusions hallucinate
Coming with nuisance fades. (How you doin?)
I can't complain, just the usual paper chase
Spit fluid, amazing statements
With music that bangs the pavement
How can take the pain like sewage for stinkin basements
Your food is tastin tainted
Your crew, they be the greatest?
Is it true, they can't be faded?
If it's true, I came to spray them, slangin tomatoes
We knew that you lay awake
You can not be saved
From a voodoo playing with Satan
The usual crazy patient

[Hook]
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!

[Verse 5]
Yo, I don't think they heard me the first time dog... HIT 'EM AGAIN!

(HIGH TIMES) what I experience when I hit the blessin
(LIFE LINES) Cuz this is serious, we will kill your best friend
(WRITE RHYMES) like no other being, spit awkward morbid shit
(BRIGHT WHITE) Lights what you see, keep walkin towards it
(SIGN HEIGHT) Web Entertainment, I'm gon' get famous with a
(FINE LINE) from arrogance, David (?) forgot what's in this
(LIGHT CRIME) I love eatin, livin, eatin, and breathin
(FIGHT MINE) Dumb bitch for repeatin the things that she did

GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!



[Verse 1]
In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal-tunnel, Marshall with start-shit-itis
Hard-headed and hot-headed
Bull-headed and pig-headed, dick-headed, a prick
A big headache, I'm sick, quick-witted for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So quick, this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it, and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
‘Cause I got jelly, like Beyoncé's pot belly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 2]
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbatin'
Fuck yeah, I'm a basket case and
I master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain because of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 3]
This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast If I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you don't coax me
It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be
Fooled, the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, ‘cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talkin' about these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
They can suck my dick while I'm pukin'
And you too, you can—

[Outro]
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Outro]
(I know you feeling yourself right now.)
(But I'm not sure she's the one—I wouldn't call her, man.)
"Hey, I'm outside."
What are you doing here?



[Intro: Haddaway, Eminem, & Lil Wayne]
Love, love
Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)







[Intro: Trick Trick]
You know what the days of talkin is over
It ain't too much mo' we can say
To try to get these, different individuals
Or motherfuckers as I like to call 'em
To just, shut the fuck up
Let's go

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
You witnessed the ass whoopin, bones got broke
When the .50-cal blast, couldn't last through the smoke
As you choke, pay attention, bear winess to this motherfucker twitchin
You excited cause none of the bullets hit you, they missed you
And we ain't trippin, wasn't after you
But you PISSED, just like a bitch when niggas laughed at you
Now you agitated a little bit, actin just like a little bitch
I figured that you would surface and knew you happened to manage to pop shit
Sayin "Trick that, Trick this"
When the balls that you had left when I popped him
You shoulda died with him, body and soul coulda burned
I'ma keep killin these bitches 'til everybody learn
Fuck time, and it's time these fuckers just start dyin
I ain't sayin this for sake of this rhyme, and I ain't LYIN
I'm man enough to say it and mean it, niggas can be gone
I'ma do another verse but it ain't much more I can SPEAK on!

[Chorus: Eminem]
There's nothin more these words can say (can say)
This hard-headed motherfucker just won't let it lay (let it lay)
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave (to his grave)
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way (my way)

[Verse 2: Proof]
Let me show you how I started as a starvin artist
This is Proof with the truth regardless of all this (for real)
As my CEO and best friend of the essence
Of why nobody in Detroit wan' test him (huh?)
Lesson learned, flesh get burned
Tecs in turn, a scar harder than a press and burn
Everlast the beef is over, you can sleep this over
Clique been filled the streets with soldiers
Includin me, I move and creep with uzi fleets
That choose to lead, I'll put your dudes to sleep
Who is he? (Trick!) Trick, no treat
That street life, AK that still'll lift your feet (blaow!)
The rest of these niggas is comical, I'mma go abominable
Split like a domino, rhymin' pro
Shine without a diamond, go Geronimo to any man with balls
Murder you bitches, still screamin' "FUCK the law!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
There's nothin more these words can say (can say)
This hard-headed motherfucker just won't let it lay (let it lay)
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave (to his grave)
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way (my way)

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
Since talkin; about it is considered as conversation
Then I'm more than happy to be the sponsor of demonstrations
From beatin' these cases to bustin' in faces and bustin' these K's
Niggas gon' act like they don't wanna act right
Fuck that! Had to begin settin the trend
Of organizin a mob, and bringin it to an end
The levels of toleration'll cease, for givin passes
That's why my reputation precedes for beatin asses
Entertainers, they take it as a joke and they tend to provoke
An up-and-comin undergrad; motherfuckers got me mad
Fuck it, I'mma give it to 'em if you really gon' do 'em
If this motherfucker even BLINKS, put a clip into him
Don't even think of negotiatin a treaty
The reason most of these niggas is hatin is cause they greedy
Uncovered another man's SHIT, now that's a real bitch
Now the NEXT motherfucker gon' DIE, that's IT!

[Chorus: Eminem]
There's nothin more these words can say (can say)
This hard-headed motherfucker just won't let it lay (let it lay)
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave (to his grave)
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way (my way)

[Outro: Trick Trick]
Kill one of you bitches



[Intro/hook: Bizarre]
Yeah… ha ha ha (BANG!)
Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (what?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates – BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
‘Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TV's and VCR's is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell: "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
‘Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

[Hook: Bizarre]
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody better test me, ‘cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways — do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window: "Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!"
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', "Get the cops, quick!"
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', "Stop it!"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one) — ain't nobody iller than me

[Hook: Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

[Outro: Bizzare]
You have now witnessed four ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast



[Intro]
Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what’s up with these hoes, man)
Gettin' in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin’)
Maybe it says somethin' about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

[Chorus 1]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

[Verse 1]
She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—

[Chorus 2]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

[Outro]
Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?



[Chorus]
I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can’t keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I’m breakin' out of this cage
I’m standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I’m mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I’ve had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
‘Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
‘Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Chorus]
I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road







[Intro: Eminem & Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
Daybed, iPod
"May-back", Maybach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (Yah!)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires is new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
We can spit it for ya advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas—

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
Daybed, iPod
"May-back", Maybach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You say you're affiliated with murderers, killas (Ayy!)
The people you run with are thuggin' (Gang!)
But you just a wannabe gunna (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling you motherfuckers
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories
Jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not gettin' through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, lettin' off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, Godzilla, harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off, and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and
I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical—but not us
The only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster!

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—
(Man, fuck this shit, let's go)



[Intro: Dr Dre and 50 Cent]
Ha ha
I'm back, bastards!
(Oh yeah)
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
(Feels good)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my cds drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track-star, running through life, chasing my dream
Best deal I made was trading the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinking is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A old G told me God's favorites have a hard time
You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me

[Verse 2: 2pac]
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's starting to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater watching the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right
I ain't slowing down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinking bout nothing more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me



[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world’s on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we’re never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin’ me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I’m simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn’t scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just—

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin’ in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Bridge: Eminem & Kehlani]
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas
Another lone-wolf gunman
Sometimes I don't know what this
World has come to, it's blowin' up
And this whole country is goin' nuts
And the NRA is in our way
They're responsible for this whole production
They hold the strings to control the puppets
And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin'
And no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'
Their loaded weapons
They love their guns more than our children
Shhh, think another one just entered in our buildin'
And we'll be—

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
Goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year-old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin' we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no
Goin' nowhere (We're on the run of our lives)
Going nowhere fast

[Bridge: Eminem & Kehlani]
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other
When we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh-oh
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no
Goin' nowhere (we're on the run of our lives)
Goin' nowhere fast



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas
Another lone-wolf gunman
Sometimes I don't know what this
World has come to, it's blowin' up
This whole country is goin' nuts
And the NRA is in our way
They're responsible for this whole production
They hold the strings to control the puppets
And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin'
And no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'

Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Forget doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track

{Intro: Trick Trick}                                                                                                          You know what the days of talkin is over
It ain't too much mo' we can say
To try to get these, different individuals
InRead invented by Teads
Or motherfuckers as I like to call 'em
To just, shut the fuck up
Let's go

{Verse 1: Trick Trick}                                                                                                                  You witnessed the ass whoopin, bones got broke
When the .50-cal blast, couldn't last through the smoke
As you choke, pay attention, bear winess to this motherfucker twitchin
You excited cause none of the bullets hit you, they missed you
And we ain't trippin, wasn't after you
But you PISSED, just like a bitch when niggas laughed at you
Now you agitated a little bit, actin just like a little bitch
I figured that you would surface and knew you happened to manage to pop shit
Sayin "Trick that, Trick this"
When the balls that you had left when I popped him
You shoulda died with him, body and soul coulda burned
I'ma keep killin these bitches 'til everybody learn
FUCK time, and it's time these fuckers just start dyin
I ain't sayin this for sake of this rhyme, and I ain't LYIN
I'm man enough to say it and mean it, niggas can be gone
I'ma do another verse but it ain't much more I can SPEAK on!
{Chorus: Eminem}
There's nothin more these words can say (can say)
This hard-headed motherfucker just won't let it lay (let it lay)
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave (to his grave)
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way (my way)

{Verse 2: Proof}                                                                                                                 Let me show you how I started as a starvin artist
This is Proof with the truth regardless of all this (for real)
As my CEO and best friend of the essence
Of why nobody in Detroit wan' test him (huh?)
Lesson learned, flesh get burned
Tecs in turn, a scar harder than a press and burn
Everlast the beef is over, you can sleep this over
Clique been filled the streets with soldiers
Includin me, I move and creep with uzi fleets
That choose to lead, I'll put your dudes to sleep
Who is he? (Trick!) Trick, no treat
That street life, AK that still'll lift your feet (blaow!)
The rest of these niggas is comical, I'mma go abominable
Split like a domino, rhymin' pro
Shine without a diamond, go Geronimo to any man with balls
Murder you bitches, still screamin' "FUCK the law!"
{Chorus}
There's nothin more these words can say (can say)
This hard-headed motherfucker just won't let it lay (let it lay)
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave (to his grave)
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way (my way)
{Verse 3: Trick Trick}                                                                                            Since talkin about it is considered as conversation
Then I'm more than HAPPY to be the sponsor of demonstrations
From beatin these cases to bustin in faces and bustin these K's
Niggas gon' act like they don't wanna act right
FUCK THAT! Had to begin settin the trend
Of organizin a mob, and bringin it to an end
The levels of toleration'll cease, for givin passes
That's why my reputation precedes for beatin asses
Entertainers, they take it as a joke and they tend to provoke
An up-and-comin undergrad; motherfuckers got me mad
Fuck it, I'mma give it to 'em if you really gon' do 'em
If this motherfucker even BLINKS, put a clip into him
Don't even think of negotiatin a treaty
The reason most of these niggas is hatin is cause they greedy
Uncovered another man's SHIT, now that's a real bitch
Now the NEXT motherfucker gon' DIE, that's IT!

Kill one of you bitches



[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear

[Hook: Rihanna]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Can’t you see?
Ain’t it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare

[Hook: Rihanna]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I’m plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (no!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motionin' you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause—

[Hook: Rihanna]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going



[Intro: 50 Cent:]
Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)

[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

[Brigde: Eminem]
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the f*ck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherf*cker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

[Bridge: Eminem]
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

[Bridge: Linkin Park]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Linkin Park & Jay-Z]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...)

[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

[Intro: Royce Da 5'9" + Eminem]
What?
Uh
The Bad!
Yeah
The Evil!
The Bad, the Evil!
Put 'em together...

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" + Eminem]
If it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
Ate hors d'œuvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers
Let you inhale the Glock smell while I'm ripping your wallet off
And slipping a Molotov in your Cocktail
Burning your contracts punch your A&R in the face
Smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
I'm on some Suge shit, if it's missing I took it
Nurse, look at this straitjacket; it's crooked
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500, hide from it
For every hundred emcees rhyming about birds
Only about two thirds really said it without words
Yo, you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's raining slugs
I'm the hottest shit in the industry
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me, defending me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals, 'cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and Bible

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" and Eminem]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
And, if it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
And by the time you all catch on, I'mma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you off of ten floors
Pull a fucking headache outta my head, and put it in yours (Take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said it oughta happen
You swallow cum bitch? "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing 'cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screaming "You ain't moving here"
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souvenir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16
Out for the blood, shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my veins, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading, I won't die, I'm never leaving
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through 'em, put the heat to 'em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" and Eminem]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
And if it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do



[Hook]
You know what you're doing when you do it for the ladies
So won't you please step up to the mic baby?

[Verse]
It's been a little boring lately
I've been playing in poison ivy and pee
I've been itching to get in some S-H-I-T
You heard what I S-A-I-D
This club? I guess they I.D
But they just let me in without it so I guess they like me
I put on my best dang white tee
But the...



Ayo, Em
Did it again

[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play

[Verse 1- Lloyd Banks]
Nah, I can't play sax or pull a rabbit out a hat
But I can cock back and blow your bladder out your back
Take that, I'll show you niggas how to rap
I'm crack, that's snowy white powder on the track
I told 50 I was going to take it to the top
Get close and get pop like hot bacon out the pot
And my goonys are loony and strip you naked on the spot
Ain't nobody scared in south, Jamaica but the cops
And speaking' bout cops, you niggas better stop quelling
And if I get knocked, I'll make bread on your head by the million
Call up the Ladens, have em Taliban the building
On {Veteran's} Day so they don't blow up the {children}

[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play

[Verse 2- Lloyd Banks]
I roll up cause it's a hold up
Ain't nothing funny stop smiling
It be the reason the crowd piling
Don't complain and die over a chain
Bang bang gang green neighborhood game
You know me I'm slipper as them baggy sweets
I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff
All the hate is sidelining and they mad he next
Cause I got the bunny's with them fatties yes
My ride thumping, talking shit, stunting
It will be repeated thumping if my finger push the button
Just for bluffing, hit for nothing
You can bust him, it don't matter the vehicle custom

[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play

[Verse 3- Tony Yayo]
I'm from New York, New York niggas die for the cheese
I air your house out like a can of fabreeze, at ease
Ease up soldier, I pull up in the rover
Click clack, ya whole life over
Baking soda in your work they gon' buy it? nope
Cause them fiends getting tired of that diet coke
I'm back baby, mad hype like a crack baby
Ask Slim Shady, my gun game crazy

[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play



[Intro]
[Mom] Momma's so proud of you, you did so good on that report card today baby
I'mma let you pick out whatever you want
[Obie] Ma, I can get any shoes I want?
[Mom] That's right, today is your day
Momma don't have much, but I'll spend it all on you today
[Obie] Okay, I want these. Ah man, I'mma look fresh when I go to school

[Verse 1]
Such a beautiful thing, being embraced by a woman that's a queen
With big dreams for the younger sibling
O couldn't do no wrong
According to report cards Obie brought home
They say good in spelling
Spelling bee's always excelling
Which was so overwhelming that Momma took him shopping
Copped him the new Jay's
Swear to God homie this was Obie's cool days
BMX'ing up the block with the tennant living next to him
Shooting hopes, who got hops?
Worthy, when he pop a jump shot
No worries, just a pocket full of sugar or whatnot
Hit the candy house on the block
It was pickle in them spot
Then things turn around when Obie'll lay down
Hear the sounds of fire rounds surrounded em
Astounded him, the volume of the blast had me so interested
Momma falling with cash, she can't get a nigga in this bitch
They wanna hit the ass, nigga start ditching class
Dad ain't around, he left a nigga
Sagging in them Superman drawers that one Saturday
Is it my fault, shit got dark?
Mom and I fall apart, relationship taunts, bad talk
"Can't stand you, looking like ya Daddy with that same walk"
{Muthafucka you - }
Now a niggas out in the streets
Two nickle plated thirty-eights on me
Can't stay away from beef
Scrapping with them niggas from the other side
Sipping Saint Ives rocking old school flannels
Old school niggas see that I'm an animal
Front me at 16, see how my roll handle
Now I'm up the O's but wait on the affy
Cuz here come my muthafuckin baby, cool
Had to slow my role
Plus my P.O. got a nigga pissing in a bowl
Hold my temperment cuz I see such innocence
When I'm looking in Kobe's pupils
Despite all the dope I sold I had to change my road
I just might be able to grow old
Older brother said, "Yo O
I'mma quit my job so we can chase our goals
I'll be manager-a-go, you can rap I suppose"
That's what we did, I still flipped a little bit
Saved up my chips and put it into music
"Well Known Asshole" a underground hit
Still scrambling, looking like shit
Baby momma think I'm smoking more then a spliff
Think a blessing came from the man who invented my gift
When Eminem said "let me hear you spit"
Wrote my signature, now Shady Obie represents
Hit em with the D12 skit
Can exhale now I see my Mom's ain't pissed
She hit em with a smile cuz Obie became focused
From independent out the trunk like them dope kids
To platinum plaques, world tours, getting noticed
An inappropriate soldier became so ferocious
In this Hip-Hop culture that I long for
The roller coaster O was on so young
Took a turn right into his song
That's right, from after school fights
To pushing white, to pursuing his career heights
One mic's, all I need involved with beats
I'mma be the streets to Jesus, cars on me
And that'll be the day you applaud and see
The underdog gets his eventually

[Outro]
Gotta end it though
I'm all in it, there's no limits
And it's so splendid
Real names, no gimmics
No image, just a soldier who spoke what he lived
From the ribs with it, the flows vintage
Obie gotta do this for real
Yeah
Obie Trice



Detroit

There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets

You can't define it, but you can feel it

You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home

From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'

You took our country from it's infancy, into industry

And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat

You became the city that carried the country

The city, like the sport, is built on dreams

People who arrived here, driven to excel

Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice

When you hurt, we hurt

Your streets witness our struggle

Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed

We've lived through the ups and the downs

But we remain, Detroit

We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you

My home

The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis

Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated

You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us

Sometimes down, but never out

Take strength in us, your people

Stay up Detroit



[Verse 1: Eminem]
You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin'
Out the back of the club like "Oh my God, he's trippin'!"
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still copping a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald—shit's on, bruh! (haha)
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 2: Eminem]
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects
So I'm batting cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (ha-ha!)
Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled ("Em…"), so's my manager
Bitch, I am mature, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me—'cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like… (what?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I’m a ten, you’re an eight
Like what I do before, after, and durin' (Rape!)
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie
You can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap and try to
Get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone
Uh-huh, I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back!
"Catch fire, get upset and fire back"
Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad: don't cry, get mad!
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't had to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
That's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head I never
Hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible?
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds



[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, play that shit
What the fuck you doing Stretch
Gotta stretch your neck
You better protect it
I’mma Inspectah Deck
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho

[Verse 1]
Paul Where’s my words at
Yo see Slim Shady yo, where the birds at
Me and Flip the middle ones
Rappers get these little ones in they mouth
These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I don’t care I ain’t afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You won’t spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I don’t care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now we’ll end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I don’t really give a damn I’ll kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot
Let on the spot, Slim, I mean woops, Grim it’s when im dim
Yo, I’m in affect mode
Rappers get they neck sewed
Get they whole threshold fucked up
Get they damn fleshed sewed
Ha, ha
I busted, I kill it, I crush it, I do it, the fluid, I spill it, I’m ill wit
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with there running with me
Kick you in the motherfucking stomach shit
Cause you don’t want none of it
Rappers always try but they always die
And rappers always stuck to me and tried to lie
(Arf, Arf)
Yo, where my dogs at
Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
In the house, It really doesn’t matter cause I still turn it out
When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse
Ha, Ha
The illest MC to come off the top
When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left
I’m wanted for theft and robbery
And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she don’t want none of me
I’m the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see
That I’m from the friggen D
Ya’ll don’t get my point I’m from Detroit
Smoking fake grass like a joint
That’s the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch
Cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich
Remain underground, can’t come off the top
You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
I’m a motherfucking landmine
Ya’ll don’t understand mine
I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldn’t have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, I’m on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I slow
Driving MC’s crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby



[Post-Hook: Eminem]
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think
I'mma keep doing my thing

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm the worst thing since fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach Mouseketeers to sing (Ahh!)
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara (AH!)
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
Till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?) The fool who visit the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol-whipped with a Mossberg
With a pistol grip, and fed pitbull shits
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits (Yeah!)
If I get too rich, I just get sued

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, I leave wit no injure, after I blow four in ya
One handstand on top of yo ninja
Crash it, Doc stir the madness
Till y'all outta work like Tony Atlas
Walking, cans in the laundry basket
America's Most, with the army after us
Fuck flossing, we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like an ace and four
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off
(Shit, the power's out) The tape is off!
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled wit arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc could shape up, touch your barber, miss (Ts! Ts!)
Fade you with a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake (Kill kill kill)
Fuck bitches face is what I'ma do
Cause that's what white boy Tano do

[Hook: Eminem & Redman]
So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
'Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this (off the wall)
So how's everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you in that mood to get rude and ill in a fight
'Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump! (off the wall)

[Post-Hook: Eminem]
No matter what people say

No matter what you may think

[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo, what my jabs are spitting, hospital, son, admit it
Rip your lips off, kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, Doc. Marshall Maths? (Print it)
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it
I'm "What's Happening," with no Re-Run
Doc. Rob De Niro when the Heat come
My barrel hang out the Camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes, it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogart it
Your wallet, your chain: the main target
Beef is like cold engine: don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten-speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker
Got the drugs stocked inside the lunch box (Uhh)
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good; thank God for vodka
Cause wit my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker (Ckkk!)
Probably got a fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
With a automatic calling me up there (Watch up!)
My man, Stan, with a gat in his hand
Staking my house out in a tan, tinted sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn (Yeah)
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam (Yeah)
Till you gotta sip through a straw, shoplift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey, Ma... maybe I'll give you a call
Psyche! You fucking bitch, suck a dick and two balls! (Hahaha)
I'm giving you all my job descrip', which is
To piss bitches and priests off with this ("...Need Jesus!")
Pop more pills till police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all! (Chm!)
Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well just be a painting smashed on the floor (AH!)

[Hook: Redman & Eminem]
So how's everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you in that mood to get rude and ill in a fight
'Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna fuck to this (off the wall)
So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and screw in a fight
'Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this (off the wall)

No matter what people say

No matter what you may think

[Outro: Eminem]
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep doing my thing
No matter... Oh



[Sampled from Eminem's "Criminal"]
{*Eminem whistling*}
[Teller:] Hi
[Eminem:] How you doin'?
[Teller:] How can I help you?
[Eminem:] Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal...
{*Gun cocks*} Put the fucking money in the bag, bitch, and I won't kill you
[Teller:] What? Oh my God, don't kill me
[Eminem:] I'm not gonna kill you, bitch. Quit fucking around
[Teller:] Don't kill me, I have two kids at home!
[Eminem:] I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you!
[Teller:] Don't kill me!
[Eminem:] Hurry the fuck up! {*Gunshot*} Thank you!

[Verse 1: Hush]
I gotta keep this engine running (I'll be back)
Pedal to the metal, Swifty better hurry up
Cause I ain't going back to jail
I don't wanna see my face up in Newsweek
I'm sitting like a duck, like Tulley up in "Blue Streak"
What the fuck is taking so long?
(Hurry up, motherfucker, I'mma hit this gas and be GONE!)
But I can't leave my homey (Hold up!) They all know me
I'm the Jeff Gord-on of this bitch, the cops can blow me
Fuck, who is that? Shit, I'm getting nervous
Staring out this dirty windshield for any persons
Damn, it's this bum, cleaning with a squeegee
(Here's a dollar, motherfucker, now scram before they see me!)
I hope they didn't ring the alarm (Shit)
Swifty's gonna have to bomb, and then it fucks up the job
But I don't care, as long as we flee this place
Cause the last thing I need is a fucking police chase, shit
Cool, here he comes, I hope he's got the stash
(Yo nigga, pull off! We heading to the bank for some mo' cash!)
Yo, there better be enough for me to get that Maybach
(Hey yo, don't worry 'bout that, dog, the cash is in our laps)

[Hook: Eminem]
Put the money in the back, bitch, this is a stickup
Anybody who moves is getting picked up, off the ground
This is the sound, this is how its going down
If I'm going down, then you're going down (Down)
Now this is the plot: we pull this off, then we split the pot
We get caught, I'm peeling off, the deal is off
But if we can pull this caper, then we can get this paper
Then I'm going, off to Tijuana
Come on, I'm ready if you are

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
(?) while I sit in the car chiefing
In the mood to be thieving this season
Hey yo, Hush, I'mma snatch what they (?)
Pull over and I'mma rob this bitch for a purpose
You can either read it or see it
(What you mean, "Read it or see it?")
It'll work, know what's worse?
It's better than having to beat a bitch up out of her purse
I been pacing this bank, patiently waiting
For the day they get up in this motherfucker
So don't drive away (I'll be right here!)
Hey ('sup?) Nigga, pop the trunk so I can grab the AK
And then I'm headed to the safe
I'm at the counter in the teller's face
"Yo, if anybody move, I'mma make spaghetti out of your wife!" (Don't shoot!)
I hopped a gate, shot a citizen
After he gave me the combination to open it
And there was nothing but Benjamins
Filled it back and jetted up, headed to the door
Hush is in the front, revving up (Motherfucker, come on!)
I jumped over the security, while he on the floor
Trying to pull my feet, I shot him before he could draw
Hit the street and we swerve
No less than a hundred thousand in our back seat
(Now I'm peeling off the curb)

[Hook: Eminem]
Put the money in the back, bitch, this is a stickup
Anybody who moves is getting picked up, off the ground
This is the sound, this is how its going down
If I'm going down, then you're going down (Down)
Now this is the plot: we pull this off, then we split the pot
We get caught, I'm peeling off, the deal is off
But if we can pull this caper, then we can get this paper
Then I'm going, off to Tijuana
Come on, I'm ready if you are

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I got some chips up my sleeve
I walked in a 7-11 and grabbed Aviv
And put the heat to his cheek
Don't even think about moving
Just gimme the loot and I'll be cruising
Along with my day and it won't be a shooting
(Mister, please don't hurt me! Here, have a Slurpee!)
Oh my God, Aviv, shut the fuck up, your voice irks me
All of this for three hundred seventy six dollars and eight cents?
This robbery does not make sense
Come on out bitch (scream) Yeah, you, behind the chip rack
Your little stank ass is on the verge of getting pimp slapped
Gimme your paper, your jewels, and all of your valuables
Serious about that scrilla, Kuniva an animal
Rushing out the front door, zigzagging and dodging traffic
If it gets drastic, my automatic will start a blasting
That's how we do it where I'm from, me, Swift, and Hush
We ducking off, contemplating which lick to rush

[Hook: Eminem]
Put the money in the back, bitch, this is a stickup
Anybody who moves is getting picked up, off the ground
This is the sound, this is how its going down
If I'm going down, then you're going down (Down)
Now this is the plot: we pull this off, then we split the pot
We get caught, I'm peeling off, the deal is off
But if we can pull this caper, then we can get this paper
Then I'm going, off to Tijuana
Come on, I'm ready if you are



[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Yeah
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
I came in the game profane, no image
I came in the game with a name I was given
From a mane who ain't give a fuck about his child—ren
I proclaim the name, though
Never in vain, no, watch the change grow
A young nigga who done gained from fame, copped the Range Ro'
Now they want my brains on the main road
But they don't understand what I came for
How I came forth with a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold?
Get money like Ross Perot
I'm often told, a coffin's the routes I go
"Oh, that's the road you on, oh no"
I'm down for the rightful tone of fo' fo'
Don't ever try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that you're loco, put holes in my photo
Nope! Ob'
Hold toast, no jokes, send slugs through your Polo
Just cause 'O' a thug, roll solo
Impose on grown folk, be a cold negro
Be-low, your grieved up people
Believe that the boy see no evil

[Hook - Busta Rhymes]
OHH! I had you yellin out when I bag the 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggas to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you get down like other niggas repeatin the dirty cycle
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]
I visualized it, O. Trice at 25 survived it
Bright but violent, invite the violence
Fist fight a fireman, be a tyrant
'Til these niggas nights is silent
O. Trice from a trife environment
He 'Roc's the Mic' no sight of retirin
Maybe when the bank account's like Leviathan
I'm in position to hire other clients then
Meanwhile, I'm a virus like Iverson
A nigga crossover, Europeans admirin
And the soldier's retirin, I ain't buyin
Motherfuckers actin like you denyin them
Who tryin a nigga, who view's bias
I figure your crew tired, my trigger introduces violence
Produce them sirens, you in the 'spital, orange juice and vitamins

[Hook - Busta Rhymes]
OHH! I had you yellin out when I bag the 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggas to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you get down like other niggas repeatin the dirty cycle
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho

[Verse 3 - Obie Trice]
A derelict who inherited hustle
My heritage married the street struggle
Like a couple of a great unk's ago (yeah)
So this blood streams through my nuts
Seems like I wasn't in touch
When the teacher had spoke (nope)
Naw I was just a preacher in oath
Sit on the bleachers and flip coke
The only reachin got through my dome
Niggas gaffle so the gat'll be chrome
Pulled the winnin raffle so I scramble with a track and the foams (woo)
Fuck a act and a clone, this is actual happening's that's factual back in my home
This is rap, but I ain't rappin so you clap in the zone
Think you're trapped in the act, for the sake of performin (nigga)
This is your warnin, run up on them wrong
And your tissue is burning a hundred degrees warm (*Blaap*)
O. Treezy's gone, my nigga Bus bring the hook back here for 'em
C'mon

[Hook - Busta Rhymes]
OHH! I had you yellin out when I bag the 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggas to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you get down like other niggas repeatin the dirty cycle
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho



[Intro]
Oh no, what's happening to my brain?
I can't believe this is happening again!

[Verse 1]
Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man, I need another mask
I'd ask my mother but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra, motherfucker look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off when I pulled a hamstring
First I Re-Up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab and I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see NyQuil

[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (don't know)
When it's going to end
Uh, oh! (Uh, oh!)
Where did it begin?
Don't go (don't go)
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)

[Verse 2]
Into the well, baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail, every day in journals
Saying how, she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, my medical marijuana
Was prescribed by a doctor, shove a typewriter up
Perez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
And fuck it while I'm venting let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard's bare
Stuff him up in the Tupperware and shove him up in there

[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (don't know)
When it's going to end
Uh, oh! (Uh, oh!)
Where did it begin?
Don't go (don't go)
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)

[Verse 3]
Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who am I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
On nights when I'm like this, no time to write just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man I'm 'bout to hyperventilate, I just have hypertension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again

[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (don't know)
When it's going to end
Uh, oh! (Uh, oh!)
Where did it begin?
Don't go (don't go)
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)



[Intro:]
Derty Harry is dead [x4]
I'm here to announce that Derty Harry is dead
Now we witness the rise of the son, Oil Can Harry, the Boss, hahaha

[Verse 1: Proof & Eminem]
My life is trapped in these lines, that’s why I’m packin' these nines
I gotta rap, I ain’t dyin', that’s in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can’t relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers 'til I’m snappin' my spine
Natural high, gotta focus, on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda, hold up
We nothin' but soldiers, slow up, this gun is loaded, roll up
They beef and we leavin' ‘em coked up
If Slim say it I spray it, if he will it I kill it
We Kilpatrick and Ilitch of Detroit, y'all can feel it
Real as this gun on my waistline, at war we don’t waste time
Ja, man, he can’t take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got school crap here at the 7, 8, and Dexter
I’m up in Hollis spendin’ dollars, ain’t feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha you flinch
When Proof shoot up that coup and wet your whole clique
Fuck it, who's next on this shit? This is [?]
When you brothers as stiff as slugs [?] ya wig
You'll be next to B.I.G., Pac it's destiny kid
Before ya lid get popped, stop testin' me, bitch

[Chorus]
Homie, you think you tough? (What?)
Think we won't fuck you up? (Punk)
Even the innocent get pistol-whipped by this pistol grip (punk)
Talkin' shit you drunk (what)
Think I won't fuck you up (punk)
We both deep, I ain't scared and I don't give a fuck (jump)

[Verse 2]
I ain't feel no games, homie don't even try
We ain't bowin' down to no one we gon' start a riot (yeah)
Heart of fire, soul of ice, roll the dice, see what you get
No advice, all my life I ain't live in this bitch
I'm a man, more I'm holdin' my ground
To loadin' these rounds, at any call approachin' my crown (blah)
I'm a king o' grimey, nothin' but killas
In behind me, I'm a bully fully cuz your team is tiny
If I was to crush 'em, got to say these Bibles are nothin'
This rifle on clutches to leave you stifled on crutches
I fight for my cousins that ain't even related
Even I stated, not from life I leave you bleedin' and faded
Hatin' made in my nature, I'm clappin' and clackin' your captain
Smackin' faggots and act as a rapper with platinum status, ya livin' flappin' 'em slappin' 'em backwards
After these rappers' status
To shadders, knowin' Proof and that Mathers has gathered an army
It's Shady bandatas
After rest the game is won, who in the matters get blamed fast with brain damage
The name that some forgot, D12, it ain't hard to feel, guard ya grill, it's REAL!

[Chorus]
Homie, you think you tough? (What?)
Think we won't fuck you up? (Punk)
Even the innocent get pistol-whipped by this pistol grip (punk)
Talkin' shit you drunk (what)
Think I won't fuck you up (punk)
We both deep, I ain't scared and I don't give a fuck (jump)



[Intro: Eminem]
Good evening
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of
Four million and a half.. feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please... undo your seat belt for takeoff [chkk]
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

[Verse 7: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on back—What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—

[Chorus: Eminem]
Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)



[Intro: Eminem & Manix]
Yo man, yo Marsh, man
Yo, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself
What of the homies, man?
Oh you want one about the posse? Alright

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride

[Verse: Eminem]
Well foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back 'til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'ma say look honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass
I said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say, "Look honey"
I thought I said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when mike catch on the bass line
That's okay ‘cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches
That's why I'ma tell you you better pull up your britches
‘Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
From me, the funky M&M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say "swallowing" phlegm and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
'Cause— I forgot the chorus
But that's okay cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you've got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot
In your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go?
I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say, "Ole foolish pride"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide



[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
‘Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being
So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
‘Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try
Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

[Verse 2: Eminem]
We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
‘Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays
And the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster
And I ain't hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search, but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
[2Pac] And we continue growin', one day at a time

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Kadaf' while Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains the same

[Verse 4: Hussein Fatal]
I spend my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt
Yeah, that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself
No matter how much I try, stay alive
I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ASCAP
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
[2Pac] And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn



[Intro]
I'm the man!

[Verse 1: M&M]
I stand in, flapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And met a reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being untooted
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "M&M will you kick it for me?"
A place where I dwell in, pull onto some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, anything is obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim like the Reptile
I look to the one-handed juggler and ask him this
"Why do you insist on stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? The hatred is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realise you're fading?
Fading from existence because simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn, and pages left to be read
So put up the front, while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook, that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton, therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one


[Hook (Scratched samples)]
Yeah, Yeah x8
Its another

[Verse 2: M&M]
Very few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline from under this colorblind
Now some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
War, the world will never enter the arguing
Awakening to the absence of unity is startling
Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you, so quit trying to
The echo we want don't mean nothing by despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable?
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless and you're dull
Its time you faced this, here, taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the earth, the deliverance of a star child
Rest with formidable talent and versatility
But such a power, there comes a responsibility
To infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance that's something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to a color of skin
Rufuser abusing is accepted, now its a trend

[Hook]

[Interlude: M&M]
You know, I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me, but you know me and what I stand for
No? so why do you speak for me and every other white man when you say that we're your enemy?

[Verse 3: M&M]
On the floor lies a broken door, because I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions, and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but oh, so impatient!
Been trying to end the rivalry
But I've heard the entice delayed it, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial, never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted?
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being reenacted
Pull up, set fort by his group, his tour is quick
He's practiced obviating, we hate him as bad as a pastor, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
The spots already occupied and I don't play leap frog
Because I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself time after time
Oh How I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
But nothing but nothing to say, stuttering and slurring
And muttering words with no meaning, attack me sounding like Danny K
Here I go again, hammering, stammering, grammaring
Eating it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving

[Sample until fade]
I'm the man!



[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (oh shit)
What now nigga? What now? What? Brewster Projects nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
(Hey man) ...That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Verse 2: Kuniva & (Eminem)]
(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping
(Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 3: Swift & (Kon Artis)]
(I been trying to call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile...what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with? They car?) With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with)
Man! (I swear) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off



[Intro]
New York City
You are now rocking with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit

[Hook]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Nigga what you say
We get loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire fire fire

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
Im buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear
Yeah, im riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
Im 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting raw deals
Im only 21, sitting on mills

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you know anything about me, then you know im a baller
If I ain't hit the first night, I ain't gon call her
Im trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when im riding through the town
Like em small, like em tall, like em black, like em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

[Hook]



[Intro]
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: "Next time you blog, try to spit a flow."
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spiderman throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Florida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot its like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(You're on fire) You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire)
(You're on fire)

[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
"Vietnam vet", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Woops!)

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot its like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
(You're on fire) You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
(You're on fire)



[Intro : Maître Gims]
T'écoutes ce son comme si tu regardais ton premier film porno
Fais bien attention on devient très vite parano
Non non non non j'vais pas me faire buter par un autre
J'rappe pour ceux qui savent et tout se passe bien apparemment
T'écoutes ce son comme si tu regardais ton premier film porno
Fais bien attention on devient très vite parano
Non non non non j'vais pas me faire buter par un autre
J'rappe pour ceux qui savent et tout se passe bien apparemment

[Couplet 1 : Maitre Gims]
Sept cinq double zero neuf pas comme New York ni comme Compton
J'suis légèrement dans les pommes comme Sam Beckett dans Code Quantum
Mourir âgé comme Jeanne Calment, mourir jeune comme Toutankhamon
T'façon j'rapperai tout en m'calmant, la juge d'enfants tout le temps qu'elle ment
J'ai la haine comme Candyman, comme un détenu qui cantine mal
Je n'apprécie pas quand on me ter-ma, la prof nous rend les comptes en maths
Coupage des têtes sur internet même contenu dans le conteneur
Les premiers cris c'est quand tu nais, les coups de tue-l'air sont comptés net
J'suis un bourrin comme Obélix, les keufs voudraient que j'obéisse
En quelques sorte que j'rentre au pays, en résumé j'suis pas payé
Les zaigos aiment la casser avec du Franco Ferre, j'crois que t'es fêlé
Tirer sur autrui c'est ce que t'aimes vas y fais-le
Ça m'a soulé, j'crois qu'il est grand temps que les pédés périssent
Coupe leur pénis, laisse les morts, retrouvés sur le périphérique
9ème zone akhi, nique la galanterie chères mesdames
Cherche pas les médailles, mais les mecs de taille pour les die
Plus qu'une seule idée, sache qu'à Paname ça pète quand c'est l'été
Les putes sont soldées, j'veux des concerts de l'ampleur de Solidays
Une minute de répis, mon pote demande une pause beuh
Rien à secouer si ceux de chez toi ils pèsent beaucoup ou pèsent peu
Des bastos ailées, faut s'taire, c'est le rêve j'essaie d'percer
C'est les problèmes, moi ça me pèse, ça bombe les pecs et ça se baise
La compo est dur à suivre donc j'crois que faut s'cramponner
J'espère que vous m'comprenez, j'veux pas être l'opprimé ni l'gros bonnet
Le fardeau est dur à suivre, 9ème c'est le far west
Les p'tits dépassent la ligne rouge dans ce cas là wAllah faut les uer-t
J'ai des maux d'tête comme Rocky Balboa, j'suis le braconnier qu'abat l'boa
Ton équipe elle fait pas l'poids, quand j'vois les keufs j'dis "palpez oi-m"
Va encore falloir cascader, mais il me faut l'bif des Castaldi
La juge moi j'pige pas qu'est-ce qu'elle dit, putain j'me suis pris quelques squettes-di
Pénurie fait que ce putain d'sort, j'crois que j'suis l'ironie
Erroné, presque périmé aux yeux d'mes pères et mères
Maître Gims, ça c'est l'volume un, la terre du milieu
Vénéneux, Lefa, Jeryzoos on t'a humilié

[Refrain : Lefa]
3ème pro, en direct de la terre du milieu
Maître Gims, Lefa, Jeryzoos on vient t'humilier
3ème pro, la mixtape dans les ue-r
Avec des flows qui te foutent accroupi comme dans les toilettes turques
3ème pro c'est le Renouveau
En direct de la terre du milieu
Maître Gims, Lefa, Jeryzoos on vient t'humilier

3ème pro c'est le Renouveau

[Couplet 2 : Lefa]
Écoute écoute la c'est l'sième-troi pro
Bon les loux-ja diront sûrement qu'ils aiment pas trop
On est à-l des halls aux Halles, loin d'être des colos-al
On s'est tous connu à l'époque puis on est resté collés-a
C'est pour mon Galsen et pour ceux qui arrêtent pas de saigner
Ceux qui ont toujours pas signé, ceux qui se sont fait bassinés
Ceux qui sont vaccinés contre les coups des porcinets
Les puristes, les passionnés, pour ceux qu'ont une force innée
Ok, on est à-l, des halls aux Halles
C'est pour le Sénégal mais c'est la merde où qu'les colons aillent
Check, on est à-l et c'est pas autrement
3ème Prototype, bouillant comme l'empire Ottoman
Faut qu'on fasse beleck, il paraît que des 'tasses s'pénètrent
Dans le rap, faut qu'on place des textes de fous et qu'on froisse des têtes
Les putes t'font des passes, les des-pe entre eux se paxent
Les dettes te surpassent, t'es bête, t'acceptes un casse : t'es dead
Check j'casse-dédi à la petite place, je t'ai dis
J'étais pas de ces types... qui bicravent pas ses titres
On a un jeu plus qu'offensif, tacle dans les gencives
Toi tu repars en civières et dans les tribunes les gens te sifflent

[Refrain : Lefa]

[Couplet 3 : JR O Crom]
Là j'kicke mais pas en solo, la clique, c'est Sexion d'Assaut
Je t'invite chez mes paranos, dans le vide comme un astronaute
Tu piges ? Y'a des têtes sous l'eau, des pitres qui trouvent pas de boulot
Le style ? J'dirais assez lourd, tu kiffes ? J'te le dis là c'est nous
Depuis le temps j'suis là j'ai l'habitude de rester à-l
C'est le bitume qui m'a fait a-ç, y'a plus le temps faut passer à
Sky, sur les grosses antennes, négro parmi des centaines
Pure mutinerie sans tie-p, 3ème Pro c'est plus de 100 thèmes
Tu perds la boule j'perds le Nord, j'me casse comme la porcelaine
En face y'a les forces de l'ordre, on t'gifle, mec y'a pas tes rents-p
Glauque comme une tête de mort, c'est con comme les Pokémons
C'est le son qui fait des rageux, mafieux comme les Corleone
De Ze-Art à G.D.N., la 9ème Zone aka
La tate-pa d'un SLR ouais à chaque fois qu'on accélère
C'est l'Wati-B mon label, les wacks MC's font la gueule
Depuis qu'ils savent que c'est rude, on bousille un tas de serrures
Le rap, c'est trop fascinant, ils m'disent : "c'est hallucinant"
Ils sont choqués surtout quand j'leur dit qu'c'est pas évident
La coupe, c'est pour la mille-fa, dans le doute, demande à Lefa
3ème Pro chez Macadam, volume 1 laisse des cadavres

[Refrain : Lefa]

Mais qui a déjà prétendu changer le monde
La merde je l'ai déjà vu en descendant de chez moi
C'est mort dans le béton j'crois qu'on va tous ter-cal
C'est eux qui m'ont dit que j'pouvais pas rester à-l
Mais qui a déjà prétendu changer le monde
La merde je l'ai déjà vu en descendant de chez moi
C'est mort dans le béton j'crois qu'on va tous ter-cal

[Intro]
Hey yo, what's up, man?
Hey yo, you been here all day, man
Y'all been here every weekend, man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first, man!
That's 'cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first
I'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man
You always rap first, I'm rappin'
I don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse
I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deteriorate, like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends tryin' to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"

[Outro: Thyme]
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?!
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
(Ayo, let me get that mic, man)
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
(I got the rhymes, bitch, I'll kick that shit)



[Kuniva]
Check my vocals, 'cause you know what I'm about
It's best to play like O.J. Simpson and I just stab out
Why did you enter? You didn't comprehend
See this is a battle for MCs who think they might win
But fuck the battle, let's take it to the streets
'Cause you a pussy, oh well, if you are what you eat
Now you can go get your crew ? you now
? me wrong ? and all this shit gon be blew out
Claiming you jumped out bitch
Nigga we bust in the bitch, you talk more shit than Reggie Miller
Never spent nothing more, nothing less
The first single that you drop is "I wanna be fresh"

[Eminem]
Any rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Trying to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Trying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat and Bizarre
? that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone
If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And take this building down 'cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop



[Intro]
Bunlar sadece sokakta duyduğum cümleler
Hadi rap yapalım!

[Verse 1]
Tek tek sik ama bak wack bitmez
Yarrağın tadına varan eve gitmez
Sikik rhymetin orospu admini
Dalgaya bak tatmin et kendini
Loş ışıkta boş kerhane işlet
Bunu alman için götünü genişlet
Ben piçin teki zamanla tanırsın
Sen daşşaktaki en kısa kılsın
Üsküdar mı lan? Biraz akıllanın
O merdivenle de sikime tırmanın
Dikine gidiyorum önüme çıkmayın
Rap'ci sikiyorum varsa göt kayın
Her şey vatan için askere gitmez
Lolipop starsa bu şarkı bitmez
Dostum kankana sen bir üçlü sar
Benim 2 topum ve bir de rapim var!

[Nakarat]
"Çok küfür ediyor böyle yapmasın!"
Azdırma sende sikim kalkmasın!
Aynaya bak lan budur derdim
Dökük evdeki fakir o piç de bendim
Sen bana söyle Ceza mı ustan?
Sagopa ya da Fuat kaçar bu kurstan
Geceler uzun kas ama yazamazsın
Sözlerin bana yadigar mapustan

[Verse 2]
Fahişe aldığı işi saymazmış
Sikilen götler rap’e doymazmış
Sokak edebiyatı mı? Sözleri gördüm
Yaptığınız rape götümle güldüm
Bıdı bıdı bidi bidi bıdı bıdı bidi bidi
Para için havlama susturun şu iti!
Puncline parshop önce yoruyorum
Mekan yeraltı flexçi sikiyorum
Kadıköy dediğin bebek mafyası
Fanları sübyan Rapçi tayfası
Hadi bana havla hergele diklen
Ender derken besmele çek len!
Memeli microphone yo çek bi' saksofon sus
Götüne girenleri ağzından kus!
Son samuray say, kılıcıda sıkı tut
Keskin götünde patladı bi' barut
Dostum kankana sen bir üçlü sar
Benim 2 topum ve bir de rapim var!

[Nakarat]
"Çok küfür ediyor böyle yapmasın"
Azdırma sende sikim kalkmasın
Aynaya bak lan budur derdim
Dökük evdeki fakir o piç de bendim
Sen bana söyle Ceza mı ustan?
Sagopa ya da Fuat kaçar bu kurstan
Geceler uzun kas ama yazamazsın
Sözlerin bana yadigar mapustan



[Intro: Eminem]
Here's the story, of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Trying to cope with everyday life
Who lives in a little house
That was built, in the middle of the street

[Verse 1: Eminem]
"Hey, Mom! 2Pac's on the jukebox"
"So what, he shot two cops
And raped a little girl while two dudes watched"
"Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him"
"You and that Tupack Shaker..."
"No! That ain't how you say his name, mom!
You're so lame, don't you know anything?"
"Yeah! I know that you'll probably go and join in a gang,"
"Yeah, right. I'm out. Where's my fuckin' Walkman at?"
"Stop cussin' at me!"
"Shut up, bitch!"
"Quit talking Black!"
Well, slammed the door and I'm out
Now, what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket, forgot it was winter
I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry
Is Mom cookin' dinner?
"Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat
Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket
Mom, look, my 2Pac tape, I just cracked it
Ma, please let me back in
It is Tupack Shaker, I just asked him"
I'm freezin', I'm sneezin'
I'm breathin' too much cold air, I'm wheezin'
"I ain't did nothin' I didn't say 'I'm leavin'"
I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin'"
(scissors cutting) "Alright, here take your damn coat and leave,"
"Fine, I'll le— Mom, you cut off the sleeves!"

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Our house
In the middle of the street

[Verse 2: Eminem]
One, two, three
My teacher's two-faced, went to lower all my school grades
Since last Tuesday I had a toothache from Kool-Aid
So Mom kicked me out, and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool cause I could go to Fred's
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home
In my own room alone beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is"
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her "Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay"
Please, Mom, please, Mom, please, I wanna stay
(Let me stay)

[Hook: Fred Durst]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My brother's incoherent, Mom's a single parent
Who ain't carin', starin' through me
Like I'm transparent, made it clear
That I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
"Please, sell my step-son some cigarettes so I can smoke"
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Back-fired, Mom sent me to school with a vengeance
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs
I can't rap, and I'm stupid
I'll never make it averaging a D+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poison from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from Ballpark
"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"
"I don't think so, now keep an eye on your brother
I'm goin' to bingo."
"But, Mom, you said you were broke."
"Who said? You got your ears messed up
From that damn rap music."

[Hook: Fred Durst]



[Hook 1: Eminem]
I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God, if you're listenin'
Please grant me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreaming, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm coming off brash, please forgive me
But, that's all I want

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G Rap, Ras Kass, Kurupt
Redman I am cut from that cloth
Write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, I'm Bad video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
While they smoked and drank
Symphony, D.O.C. inspired me to write what
Would eventually put me on airplanes like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu-Tang, you know our history, but hats off
When we rap this Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank God for the one-two cadence
Thank God for the lunchroom tables
I'm trying to be the sickest nigga, dead or alive
And if I happen to fall short, it's been one hell of a ride
Chronic 1 and 2, looking up at the sky at the sun
Up until the day the sun is you
You listening to hip-hop, you in Jay' house
Wayne' house, Nas' house
Em' house, Our House

[Hook 2: Skylar Grey]
So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack
But in the words of a ten year old, my shit was getting phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowing how the booth would feel, what's ADAT's and two inch reel
How you ad-lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike you made a monster
Now everyday's a game of Contra, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm telling you
Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggas sounding, damn
Weak head, ya'll suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna to be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life, so wipe your feet before you step in
Our house

The same time being as real as can be

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passed us by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours, so send cowards
The message from Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

[Verse 4: Eminem]
In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, if you can hear this sound in-
-side my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsights, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad, felt like-I-could-go-mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bothered me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back into working a regular job?
Fuck that, I'mma go hard, grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck theyselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell'
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world it's like Clash of the Titans
I released the cracker it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron
So come on in, at your own risk
This is (Our House) Bitch!

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I never wanted a chain that was encrusted
I wanted to be respected amongst my peers and to be trusted
Wanted not to be complacent, though, okay with my regression
I was banking hip-hop would do away with my depression
I wanted to be understood but they never got my deposition
I never wanted attention, but I lusted recognition
Wanted peace with my child's mom, wanted to be a better dad
Not as a person, wanted to give that nigga choices I never had
Which honestly kept me alive, 'cause in order for me to give
I needed not to be suicidal, though it was killing me just to live
Wanted to make mother cry and choke her up 'cause she proud
Wanted to marry my dreams, so I cheated on fear, broke up with my doubts
So I got no choice but to succeed and show music that I'm capable
She the one I'm grateful to and I'd hate for her
To think that I'm unfaithful too
If she did her soul would bleed
But they raised another breed in (our house)

[Intro Royce da 5'9]
We them back pack niggas
Rap rap niggas
You’ll be talking shit about all day
Internet underground, niggas
Our intellect just won't allow us to make records y'all way

[Hook: Royce da 5'9]
Get over yourselves, fucker
Get over yourselves, sucker

Guess that we them back pack niggas
Rap rap niggas
Who will never sell a record, no way
Guess what sucker

We made it, we made it, we made it
But we did it our way, our way, our way
Though it took some time but we finally made it
Now can you truly say that you made it? Your Way

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9]
Dear mister end all be all of an opinion
Fuck what you’re saying, you’ve got fans but we’ve got minions
Plus Eminem got Stans like an arena, I went and seen it
From abroad to back home, y'all ain't got to clap
We’re gonna make this track clap, clap, clap for him
Let me take your back, we turn one song to a group, to a concert, to a record deal
And yes it feels more like carpentry than artistry God's work let’s get real
All you hear is them niggas like 50 too while we in the 62
But it ain’t no industry business I ain’t privy to
Yeah and for y'all niggas that tired of it
Just lay down and picture your soul over your body

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Check my rhyme, timeline, I took time with every line
Now I don't rhyme unless a check gets signed
My bank account, it don’t look bad
I got house gang, hood swag
I'm a Crook that'll Jump Off with five 9's or a good jab
Hell yeah, I could brag, dude ain't never switch
Whether the booth or on the strip I kept a Mac in my book bag
You mad little nigga cause I'm holding the belt
Do some ad-libs nigga, get over yourself
I’m here for the duration, you’re here to reputation
Slide them Dre's over your shit, prepare your ears for devastation
‘Cause if YAOWA on that motherfucker Yaowa going in
Y'all wan' be mad go right ahead but once again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
As a poster child for Photoshop my whole image was wrong
Straight out a movie, took a pill and all my limits were gone
Now you mention the best and you gotta argue, son
Clothes I used to borrow some now it's name brand drawers
Just so my dick can see how far I've come
Changing the topic to women they know me to keep mine in labels
That's how they drape judging of shapes I should keep mine in stables
They left him for dead, took him to watch me resurrect, that shit's pathetic
Shouldered the blame it's a shame it took hindsight to give me credit
I got kitchens in the masters, the fish tank is a wall
I got couches in the closets, my estate is confused
We say that blatantly for the fools that missed with a blessing that steal
There’s no other outcome when you question my will

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
They say I’d never make it, never make it
My rhyme scheme is a crime scene, dog I yellow tape it
For lyrical murder, I’m on the verge of my next merger
Had to crawl before I walk so after I ex Gerber
I took it a step further
I took over the web servers
I took over the west word to these fresh words
And rode the wave of web surfers
A circus- that’s what this industry makes me think about
Cause selling out's a shortcut integrity's the scenic route
But you have never seen a crew or better team
While you forever sleep we’re doing everything you fuckers dream about
Sucker Slaughterhouse is what they scream and shout
Not the crowd, I mean your bitch now

[Hook]



[Intro: Obie Trice] + (Stat Quo)
Stat
(Where you at nigga?)
I'm on the road. I'm on my way down there, 75 south nigga
(Man bring that muthafuckin work man. We gotta fill these god damn streets
You understand what I'm talkin bout pimp need ta ask...)

[1st Verse]
Roll out, striaght to the A-T-L
Coming from the D-E-T gotta bail
Gotta get mail in abundance
Stat watch that yay on the oven
Nigga this hustling
Had enough getting nothin
Couped in the group, ballers gotta get accustomed
So I push that dust, thust me crush 'em
Push that new stank ugly
Snowflakes in the hood like flurrys
Nigga so urgently gotta earn that cheese affirmitevly
The firm with me gotta turn the keys of a 64 fever
So eager, go re-up
Get cheese on an old school beeper
No two-ways, no feds
Only way a nigga get head, get bread
Stay low pro, no po-po
No hoes in the spot where the dough grows

[Hook]
We got to get this paper dawg any way it takes
Before you see a nigga like myself break
Even if it means that we rollin out of state
Gotta get it at a good rate
Get bucks, come home with the weight up

[2nd Verse]
Dippin now, straight to the C-A-L
Get Dre on the phone
Gotta put that fluff on hold
Home grown, holmes know
Bubonic chronic gots ta move on it soon as possible
Honest U-Haul's moving by two annonymous drivers reclining
Just a couple of folks reload, from the west to the east coast
Gotta get that dough, flip them bows
Get back to the mo' like pronto
With guacamole niggas, can't grow these
Got it where they make nachos
Not so? taste that
Wipe the a-jax off that plastic wrap
Look at him now, his ass sagging like my dickie khaks'
In fact nigga chief on that
Please believe I gotta get them stacks

[Hook]

[3rd Verse]
Haters, faders know, Detroit flavor gave us bank roll
Nigga never stress those stank hoes, Minnesota got that stro we on
Petroleon, on that rap
Gotta flip them o's like that
Get that dough right back, gotta make sure niggas in tact strapped
Niggas get mad, gotta have what you got
Gotta put them boys in bags, make noise niggas know you ain't having that
Gotta have it at, gettin assets
Where the math at, nigga pass that
No average, pure
What do you think a nigga down here for?
Get more, gotta push them Bentley 'Zures
Niggas on empty, gotta get it up plenty
Niggas don't hear me

[Hook]



[Intro]
Oh I posted bail? I'm out this motherfucker? I can go?!
Aw, fuck y'all! Ay fuck the judge!
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attorney, the prosecutor
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box, fuck all y'all!
Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
Y'all ain't never gon' see me in this motherfucker again!
Drop that shit L G
Let these ol' punk-ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit for the '94
Niggas ain't goin' back to court, you stank ass bitches

[Verse 1]
I'm stuck in jail, the D.A.'s tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, if I had a good attorney
Want to label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up - I ain't trippin'
In the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin', they askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep! they takin' Polaroids
And I'm tryin' to use the phone, but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my Glock, cause it's major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastic in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone, that's my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' co-llect calls to my ol' bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshit bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutter, I was saved from hell
And I'm a thug, I was raised in jail, now I'm out on bail

[Hook]
(Out on bail) You know what fuckin' time it is
I'm out on bail (thug life nigga) 50,000 BEYOTCH! I'm out on bail
(Out on bail) Hand me some motherfuckin' cold 40's in this bitch nigga
Cause I'm out on bail (thug life nigga)
Ay pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex
Yes bitch, that's a Presidential

[Verse 2]
I'm stuck in jail, and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail, if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark when I start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it, hey
And sellin' product to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I got a lot of love
Hangin' out with the O.G.'s, shootin' up the clubs
And momma told me, don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me, then it's on g
Got me sittin' in a cell, a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven?
Got my bitches on the outside, writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me, and the shit'll get better
I don't believe 'em cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your picture's on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets, I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous, I'm on bail

[Hook]
(Out on bail) You know what fuckin' time it is
I'm out on bail (thug life nigga) 50,000 BEYOTCH! I'm out on bail
(Out on bail) Hand me some motherfuckin' cold 40's in this bitch nigga
Cause I'm out on bail (thug life nigga)
Ay pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex
Yes bitch, that's a Presidential

[Outro]
Motherfuckers tryin', to harass a player
Man I ain't goin' for this ol' crazy ol' shit
Dealin' with you scandalous bitches
Y'all need to pop some of these crooked ass motherfuckin' judges
But here go the motherfuckin' fetti, I'm out on bail
I'll see you motherfuckers at the next show
By the way, where is my bitch?
You know, that's that ol' real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine
Y'knahmsayin? I wouldn't waste yo' motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, it's that real shit
Talkin' 'bout that shit you can be tellin' your grandkids about y'know?
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
This is for my fuckin' nigga 'em and the motherfuckin' boys
In case you wonderin', we doin' this shit, hell motherfuckin' yeah
An ounce of that shit, sittin' in yo' motherfuckin' lap
Now press rewind nigga



[Intro: Eminem]
Nah, we ain't done!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I love being hated, it's great, it lets me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way, I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you, and it's bugged
'Cause you keep fucking with us, we keep fucking you up
And keep pulling the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what we're doing
So much there ain't nothing that we love more than "Pulling Your Skirts Up"
And exposing you hoes so much, people are starting to wonder
What's up with them fucking Wonder Woman underoos?
Do unto others of you will have done unto you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you?
You gon' ask yourself, how come your mans
Didn't empty that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance?
You keep asking us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any rationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start building
Soon as we enter the 106 & Park building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fucking with a

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Fucking with a beef keeper, see you ain't eager to greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That'll eat ya, niggas wanna keep speaking
Like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a nigga's street
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searching for you longer than The Legend of Zelda
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
Captain that a basset hound couldn't even smell ya
Body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance, bitch!
You get bombed like Lebanon with my own tactic
I snatch your head like one of Saddam's kids

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Motherfucker, I'll handle you, we can have it out on any avenue
An "Average Man" flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles, cannons and ammunition
Reload with precision, nigga, know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Pushing crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasing green is the dream, when you're young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggas and they all get down
Resolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said "all men get down"
(Kuniva!)

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
While you're punching and tackling punks
I'm handling chumps, packing a pump
That's longer than the elephant trunk
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shoot you and scream "increase the peace"
A monster, pistol packing, pushing niggas off they Hondas
Stomp you, get it cracking, yanking bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleeping stuff, I was stealing the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up! Before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets taking a nap, bleeding and lugged up
"Who Want What?" like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleeping

[Verse 5: Proof]
Know much'bout Meyer Lansky, don't tussle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the shoulders
We the soldiers, yall the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster
Upstairs the monsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster (Boof!)
I'm back nigga (Proof!), I reappear
Shoot like, homie ain't seeing clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice
(Bizzy!)

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fucking wife beaters
I guess that describes my life
I don't even know who song this is (Obie Trice)
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top and Reeboks
This Ja Rule beef I ain't getting in
I'll need an R&B singer to sing at my wedding
I'll turn your face into a fucking meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishing with your granny
I'll Shit on You, I'll pee on R. Kelly, too
This is Bizarre, see you "Devil's Night 2"



[Teller]
Don't kill me!

[Eminem]
Hurry the fuck up! 
(Shoots the teller)
Thank you! 
(Running)
Go, go, go! What the... fuck? The fuck did he go?
Mothafucka bail on me? Fuck you! (Car stops working)
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me!
Are you fucking kidding me? Shit! 
(Running)
(Climbs a fence)
Get off! 
(Shoots a dog)
Ha-ha! 
(Sirens)
Parking lot! Shit, ah!

[Officer]
Let me see your hands, bend over!

[Eminem]
Ah, fuck it!
(Shoots himself)



[Intro]
You know we’re ‘bout that club life, thug life
Got this bitch bumping...
Pocket full of money (we rollin’)
Pocket full of money (we rollin’)
P-p-p-pocket full of money
You know we’re ‘bout that club life, thug life
Got this bitch bumping like a bug bite, club life
Pocket full of money (we rollin’)
Pocket full of money (we rollin’)
P-p-p-pocket full of money

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
Y’all niggas fake as fuck
Lipstick on my collar, I couldn’t make this up
I live in the realest state like it’s housing
Life is grand, like a thousand
Stopless counting, my bitch is a walking fountain
I talk to bosses, you talk to bouncers
Every bad bitch you see in here is coming with us
So I suggest you...

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Get off of her, officer get rid of them cuffs
So many bitches 'round I don’t even know what to do with them
Head ain’t even fun no more unless there’s two of them
To tell the truth, I think beating it is easy
So when I say I poppin models, y’all got reasons to believe me
Keeping it breezy, just me and my Weeknd CD
Wanna fly in for the week and you see me
Can tell I be beating it beastly cause look at how weakened her knees be
With the dome trash, and she fuck me fast
Now she on stand-by, blame the buddy pass

[Hook]
You know we’re ‘bout that club life, thug life
Got this bitch bumping like a bug bite, thug life
Pockets full of money (we rollin’)
P-p-pockets full of money (we rollin’)
P-p-pockets full of money
Park that motherfucker sideways
Park that motherfucker sideways (we rollin’)
Park that motherfucker sideways
To let these niggas know you’re rolling in some motherfucking shit

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Like A.I. I cross over when I’m near a mic
I stay fly even though I got a fear of heights
I aim steady when I’m gunning with one of them nines
And you ain’t ready for a hustler who hugging his grind
My chain heavy, so heavy the medallion broke the main levy
Now that motherfucker is flooded with diamonds
Like a broke nigga, I ain’t got nothing to lose
But I’m rich in the club, the couch is under my shoes

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
And shawty mouth is under my ooo...
I can’t say that, radio don’t play that
I’m so cool the sun gotta hate that
But it can never blind me, now where my Rays at?
Yeah, boy, this is payback
Y’all was hating back in May, so I said “Hey” and bought a Maybach
The roof gone, so I park it where the shade at
Leave it sideways and spin the wheel, no Sajak

[Hook]



Aw yeah
Let's go

(Aw yeah, let's go, take the course check it out.)
My posse
It's my posse yeah
My posse
It's my posse yeah

Many occasions and situations are endangered
My posse has arisen in collision in Vertėjas
The outcome is the same as; the remains are never changing
No surprise we specialise in facial re-arranging
'clusion is protrusion using this line as I curb
Plus, damage with advantage we'll step on you like a smurf
Pissing competition with an underdog ambition
Given our position pain inflicts in repetition
Ridicule arrival and survival of a battle
Sequential is essential first intent'n to dismantle
Copulate and demonstrate a form of repercussion
So fasten your mouth 'fo' we start passin' out concussions

My posse
It's my posse, yeah
My posse
It's my posse

My posse

(Alright now)

Nobody can catch the way that I display the rhymes
I lace those, they just stand and huddled in dismay and say "how the hell did he do that"
But if I told them how, they still would never be able to get the pattern
It's just the wondrous way of one who's working as a new jack
Trying to prove that in order to make you move you take the hyper crew and have the hypest rhymer and then you come up with something what?...hype
Taking the time to demonstrate the rhymes that I create
Its only half the job and I'm working a double shift to make it right
Cause other things that go along with a job like making sure you have a style that's totally different from the others in the basement
Always staying a couple of steps ahead
And even though we're bred to look the same the difference is our styles are separateus

My posse
It's my posse yeah
My posse
It's my posse yeah


Oooh it's my posse
Oooh it's my posse
Oooh it's my posse
It's my poooaaoooaaoooaaoooaaaooaooasssseeee



[Verse 1]
I got to be bout the meanest ever
You defeat me never
I was born dead!
Fat nigga with horns in his head
Calls himself the east side King! He breathes lightning!
You can see electrical currents when he's rhyming
Skin made of Teflon, he don't need no vest on
He proceeds to get blown, when he bleeds the shits chrome!
He ain't a human being. Wait till you see him
He's a true demon
He uses trees
To defecate on loose-leaf
A ghetto legend came out the womb at 11
With the face of a felon, but a face like a meteor hit him
A Detroit icon!
With a stomach made of pistols, eye of tiger, heart of lion
The ghetto messiah! It's on forever
1877, more calm then ya!
Never knew the east side, he would have to run
Calm like a thief in the night with a mask and a gun

[Hook]
Ohh... somebody pass me a lighter (Well)
Oh won't you please light this blunt up for me (Tell 'em why!)
So I can get high and start spittin the fire (Aw, Gordy!)
Let these niggas know why they call you 'siah

[Verse 2]
Lyrics comin with the strength of ten men
Not even with titanium bones, I'll end them
I'm stopping his men, now he's breathin slowly
I hope he don't pee
On himself when I'm rhymin his legs and break one knee
A verbal arsonist, my verse it too hot to spit
Burning off all your skin, murder your ligaments
Why do they call me King? I ain't self proclaimed
These eyes saw a whole lot of niggas die cause they felt the flame
Think I'm talkin just to hear my motherfucking self talk?
I am to the east side what Biggie was to New York
Hope I'm lyrically uplifting ya when I'm dropping this
Stay humble, never arrogant. Just confident
I just want Detroit to love me, oh I cry for you
I looked out yelling your name, ready to die for you
I just want to puff a blunt, oh just for you
Oh Detroit, I love you so (Oh! Well....)

[Hook]
Ohh... somebody pass me a lighter
Oh won't you please light this blunt up for me. (Tell 'em why!)
So I can get high and start spittin the fire. (Aw, Gordy!)
Let these niggas know why they call you 'siah

[Verse 3]
I got the scripture of a king, paint the perfect picture
A worthless nigga
Peseants, bow down to my presence
With these two braids sticking up
In case you were wondering "Why in the fuck
Does he have the two braids sticking up?"
Drinkin gin outta a a tenth-century English cup
Fuck shootin - tou cross me, your head's bein cut (Off wit his head!)
My cape is from an African lion eye, from a sacred African tribe
They'll prasie me after I die!
Forty eight frames made from an elephant's tusk
Motor gauges on like the president or something
Old people lookin like, I know he said something
But go and let him do his thing
He's the east side's king
Please don't try to do it people, boy this guys out of it
Please don't try to do it people, oh this guys out of it!
Well, don't try to interview him, oh this guys out of it!
Only thing he's gonna scream is (well, well, well, well)

[Hook]
Ohh... somebody pass me a lighter
Oh won't you please light this blunt up for me (Tell 'em why!)
So I can get high and start spittin the fire (Aw, Gordy!)
Let these niggas know why they call you 'siah



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
I owe you for this one

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sit and politic with passengers from 9/11
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines
Knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends
They know how to pretend

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you're patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit
They ain't sayin' shit — spray 'em, 50!
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, ‘cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier
You now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

[Hook 2: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50 — man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
‘Cause I'll break your face
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you makin' a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets
With all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94: "We don't love them hoes."
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six
Niggas wearin' flags ‘cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood
And filled up with holes, motherfucker

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong



[Skit: Paul Rosenberg]
Hey Em, It's Paul. Umm, I listened to the new album. Umm, are you really gonna just reply to everybody who you don't like what they have to say, uh, about you or the stuff you're working on? I mean, I don't know if that's really a great idea, it's-it's like, what's next? Kamikaze 2, the album where you reply to everybody who didn't like the album that you made replying to everybody that didn't like the previous album? It's a slippery slope. I-I don't know if it's a really good idea. Umm, anyway, hit me back.



Em, what's going on?
This is Paul Rosenberg, your faithful attorney at law
Listen, I listened to the rough copy of your album
And, uh, y'know, I've just got to be honest with you
Can you tone it down a little bit?
Because there's only so much I can explain
Give me a call



[Paul]
Em, what’s going on?
It’s Paul. Uh…
Dre gave me a copy of the new album
And I just…*sigh*…Fuck it!



Em, it's Paul
Listen, Joel just called me and
He said you're in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around
Like an idiot, outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself in trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you
Leave your fuckin' gun at home



Hey Em, it's Paul, uh, listen, I just got a call from the label
And you're probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the "Just Lose It" video
And, um, I mean he's pissed, so I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this
Um, oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um
They heard a rumor that you got a new gun
Um, I know it's probably not true
But I just need to talk to you about that
So, um, gimme a call



[Paul Rosenberg]
Em? It's Paul
Ah, I just listened to the entire album
You gotta be fucking kidding me
I mean with this Christopher Reeves shit?
You know the guy's dead, right?
And then the whole gay stepfather incest rape thing?
I don't have your back on this one
I can't even fuckin' handle it, I'm done



[Produced by Eminem]

Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
The way you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill

EMINEM YOU FUCKING BITCH







I



[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 1]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 2]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Bridge]
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

[Verse 3]
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal



I'm ice grilling you, staring you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, cause Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spasmodic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in a hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai-weed
Looking Chinese with my knee's, stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope god forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killing my girlfriends



[Eminem]
Yo yo, back again
Ha-ha-ha (Agh!)
Turn it up a little bit, pick it up pick it up
Yo pick it up, pick it up
Yo pick it up
If you find a phone call in a Tim Westwood line, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up! Pick it up!

[Proof]
If your ball falls out with a pad on the floor, what the hell you gonna do? (Pick it up! Pick it up!)

[Eminem]
While I'm smacking up girls to keep the hoes in check
The double S-Slim Shady wreck the London set
Sit back and relax while my squad smokes crack
And tap your man back and be like (Did you see that?)
Ah yes, coming from the mother freaking Midwest
Lift your shirt up and let me see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day, three times a night
I got G-fulls of criminal peoples
Jumping out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in a Benz Jeep
Brothers be like: Eminem changed his style up!
Shut the hell up, I'm still seven miles slut!
It's '97 so get with it
Peep that back in the day stuff when that Infinite tape was hitting
Listen, must we forget
I originated all that rough shit, that talk drug shit
That left motherfuckers who said our sound like [?]
Detroit city is where I grew up bitch
Peace to all my Outsidaz in Jers
Forget what you heard, this is three and one third

[Proof]
If you got an STD and your penis falls on the floor (What the hell you gonna do?)
Pick it up! Pick it up! (Ahhh yeah yeah yeahhh pick it up, pick it up)
If you see a Slim Shady tape on the fucking rack
What does Dre do? (ooohhhh)
(On the uckin rack, on the uck without the f)

[Eminem]
I get deaf MCees stepped to the left
I bust MCees and my name is Wyclef
How you doing? I play the banjo, piano whatever it is I rock like Barry Manilow
Yo it's Slim Shady on the freaking deck
Y'all don't check it out I wreck the Frim Shady set
The Frim Shady is what I said because I'm freaking drunk
I pick it up, pick it up, I sound like a punk

[Proof]
Ayo they wish that they could ban me black
Yo, you standing back
Def methods, ayo got my hand in that
Who ever running it, ayo you get a jammed knee cap
Make the healthiest in your fam, handicap
You a fan of rap, my clan will tap your school, home, ya bitch house
Pull my nine millie, you gonna die with your fist out
Enemas is over with
Venomous is cobra spit
Aggressive dialect with aggressive sober pitch
My bionic phonics, demolish your logic, demonic can't stand the chronic impossible to hold on like vomit
Mics I palm it, cause they the bomb-it
Like terrorist is Islamic, I enter your atmosphere like a comet
The new god of rap, call me bigger Thor
Snap your back when I slap your ass in a figure four
From miles around they can feel us lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu Tang sound like the village people (haha)
Be no sequel, of the energize, finish style, bust 'em down right now, the winner is... me
Then my man Mr. Paul we gonna star
Make your heart beat for your trying get down with us
We ball to the end, it's time to pretend
My friend to the left of me, the death of me
Me recipe to be with this don't even test MCees
Y'all can't get with us it's the dress, dress on ya

Lil pump ur rhymes are so dump *(dr dre adlib: tell em nigga!)*
We dont wear gucci cause we r not sellout losers like you
Im not a youtube rapper ill destroy you all in the count of 1 and 2
These mumble rappers r so childish unlike donald glover mite as well watch blues clues
Why do we giv clout to dumbass losers like kid buu?
Listenin to mumble rap hell no id rather eat some poo
Kanye the idiot who helped mumble rap takeover just by going poopity scoop *(50 cent adlib: the fuck?)*
Stab mumbe rap in da eyelash
Unlike mumble rap i dont fuck underage girls like billie eilish
I get sick by mumble rap everytime im watchin
Everybody hates mumble rap even bobby tarantino aka logic
Logic doesnt want anyone 2 kill themself but he told me that mumble rappers should
I wish a bitch ass mumble rapper would *(logic adlib: damn right nigga)*
Ill burn playboi carti alive imma make sure dies lit
Lyrical rap is back so mumblers can go join mcdonalds makin fries bitch!
Lorde nd beyonce can taste my dick *(jay z adlib: the fuck?)*
Ill give mumble rap my ass to lick
Yung lean nd ugly god are frauds as fuck fam
Whos next to claim they fucked my bitch god damn

Childish Gambino (Chorus):
You motherfuckers claim 2 be the king of the trap?
Bitch please! ur all just a piece of trash
This is america where the big dogs attack the mumble cats
With the redbone all you motherfuckers do is fap
Here's what i think! slam u mumble fuckers on the mat

On the mat uhh! on the mat nigga! on the mat uh!
On the mat, just a piece of trash!
On the mat uhh! on the mat nigga! on the mat uh! yo! yo!

Joyner Lucas:
The underdog who never lost hope is back
Lucky you mumble rappers cus ur in the presence of the highlight of this rap track
Tory lamez mimik my style he a pure mumble rapper and a fraud
Tory the bitch boy forcing dax and travis scott to apologize well i do not applaud *(dax adlib: IT'S DAX!)* *(Travis scott adlib: straight up)*
You are not litty tory, you are shitty
Cheef keef is the shit i dont like cause he yucky
Your not a gorilla, your a little stupid monkey
Now the nerds are gonna call me racist for saying monkey
Watch out before i get a lil funky
If u got a problem then suck me
Ill turn blueface into redface after i slash his face wit my bars
Slash his face so bad he end up wit scars
Lil xan a whiny litle boy
I play these mumbl rapprs like a toy
Shout out to the legend my homie xxxtentacion
Mumble rap does not deseve to be in the rap nation
Tom mcdonald a fuckin cornball
Puttin my dick in the rap game give em a torn hole
Tekashi got what he deserved, jail time
Lil pumps dumbass saying nigga but he pale white
Stranger things than mumble rap is logic and his shit
Logic may b a good rapper but he a bitch
The type of nigga 2 probbably snitch
The confessions of my dangerous mind is puttin logic and mumble rap to sleep

Chorus (Childish Gambino)

J.Cole:
Yeezy yeezy
Take it easy
U a false prophet nd ur so fucking cheesy
Ur not as good as the likes of g-eazy *(g-eazy adlib: dam right)*
U think ur a god
Well ur nowhere near a god ur a fraud
Pusha t stop hurting my friend drake
U a insecure bitch ur so fake
Daytona album of the year? lol not even close, lame
Ur mumble rappin ass was sad when u lost the grammys now go back 2 sellin cocaine
Lil pump stop running ur mouth remember u are my son
I fathered u on my interview with u now its time to have some fun
I love u pump but no one else does nd we all can't stand ur songs
At this rate ull end up paying chicks to tap them with thongs
So lil pump, come sit on my lap
There’s more in life than mixin mumble wit trap
I don’t want u to end up like lil peep dat situetion wud b crap
I’m like thanos destroyin mumble in an instant wit a snap
I collabed with 21 so i could teach him to rap
He still shit didn't learn anything so hes still got a bad rep
Smokepurrp is trash throw hem in the bin
Boogie wit da hoodie is an idiot cut all the mumble rappas limbs
I fuck ur bitchez we on power trip
Eatin mumble rappers like attentin seeka lil xan like im eatin chips *(kendrick adlib: yummy!)*
Mumble rap taking over is so annoyin its making me snarl
In two years the mumble rappers will be kissin james charles
U need to be smart nd intellectual 2 listen 2 my music
These mumble rap doofuses hav no brain thats why they can't listen so they go drug abusin
I sit nd watch mumblers liek lil yachy nd ksi tak l's after watchin rick n morty
Puttin my dick in da earth nd its face cuz im getting horny
1985 i arrived and fathered mumble crappers
Now cum nd lick this dick cuz my testicles u lackers
I got the fire squad this is a tale of two cities
Grab the sword and cut mumble rap then flush em cause they shitty
U won't ever perform in stadiums nd sold out dates and shows cause ur all flops
Soon u mumble rapper crappers will b in love & hip hop *(JCole adlib: nigga)*
Get on my nuts den off my dick shout out 2 JID
Mumble rap defines my album kids on drugs aka kod
Got a problem well you can smd

Childish Gambino: (Chorus)

Eminem:
First off shout out my homie big sean *(big sean: i hear u my nigga big ups!)*

You motherfuckers are still a waste of space
You cannot keep up with my fast pace
Tyler creator Nd Vince staples bit my hand so I destroyd em And shat on their face
You say you the king but I am the ace
Your jig is up like my bro jay z
Renegading mumble rappers such as earl sweatshirt tyga nd swae lee
Justin bieber u dumb bitch what do u know about rap?
Go back to makin shit songs cus ur track wit ed sheeran was crap
Khalid sounds like a whale
Killshot on mgk i will not fail
I made a better song with ed sheeran than justin bieber did
Drown this beaver in a river nd let his face cover in blood and red
Nd fuck trippie redd
Put mumble rap babys on da bed
I kill everyone even da feds
Me nd logic raped mumble rap wit waste of space nd homicide this is the last killshot now
Like how i killshot on mgk now everybody time to bow
I dont need 2 collab with fatass dj khaled
That fat notherfucker meeds to eat a salad
Gucci mane u hypocrite why u workin with logic after dissin me
U even worked with jake paul so dumbass ur dismissed g
Mgk still crying over my killshot diss u brought it on urself bitch im not sorry
Why ur dumbass invited logan and jake paul to ur party
Why u all supportin goons

And bouncing on kanyes big belly
And ill jab the belly of machin gun kelly
None of u mumblers can hurt me
U arent worthy
Soulja boy nd 6ix9ine probs doin it in jail they whack
Dumb bitches worshippin lele pons nd tana mongeua imma go for the smack
Why the fuck is donald trump still president
Fuck what you saying trump we ain't listenin
Ja rule a dumb fool
50 cent a killer like mike he ran with your jewels
Iggy azalea u plastic slut
Im the dog eating ur ass wit my bars u a lil mut
Motherfucks tryna call me racist 4 sayin stupid monkey migos
Migos monkeys not because of their skin cause of their shitty choppy flow
Flush these pieces of trash and waste of space down the toilet cause they shit
Leave my dick in ur mouth and leave my daughter out of it

50 Cent: GGGGGG UNIT *Beat stops*

Eminem, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Hopsin, Logic, Joyner Lucas, Token, G-Eazy, Childish Gambino & J-Cole all together: FUCK MUMBLE RAP!

Tyler creator Nd Vince staples bit my hand so I destroyd em And shat on their face
You say you the king but I am the ace
Your jig is up like my bro jay z
Renegading mumble rappers such as earl sweatshirt tyga nd swae lee
Justin bieber u dumb bitch what do u know about rap?
Go back to makin shit songs cus ur track wit ed sheeran was crap
Khalid sounds like a whale
Killshot on mgk i will not fail
I made a better song with ed sheeran than justin bieber did
Drown this beaver in a river nd let his face cover in blood and red

Dumb bitches worshippin lele pons nd tana mongeua imma go for the smack

Motherfucks tryna call me racist 4 sayin stupid monkey migos
Migos monkeys not because of their skin cause of their shitty choppy flow
Flush these pieces of trash and waste of space down the toilet cause they shit

[Eminem]
G-SHIT

[Bizarre]
Whattup
I gotta tell you motherfuckers the truth
This is straight G shit
And all you can do is respect it

[Verse 1: Swift]
Well I'mma state my name, Swift McVay
None of y'all niggas got shit to say
Rhymes keep coming off like a toupee
Plus I'm big headed running things my way
A selfish man, the back of the hand
Be slapping the hell out of hoes because I can
Prostitute, I want my loot
And I don't give a fuck about your broke-ass man and
Y'all giving niggas what they needing
'til bitches understand I'm mean and
Swift McVay is, blowing up
Courvosier 'til I'm throwing up
Wanna playa hate me, bitch so what?
What's yo' function? Where's yo' bucks?
All you wanna do is wanna stick him up
You wanna rob me but I got too much (hah)
D12, naturally lifted
You niggas better duck when I cock the biscuit
You fuck wit me, I fuck wit you
Your entourage, nigga fuck them too
I got grenades
What the hell your little twenty-two gon' do?
(Y'all ain't gon' shoot)
Y'all major soft
Cops getting mad cause I paid 'em off, made 'em cough
Blood and shit
That's what the hell you motherfuckers get, we runs this bitch?
So hey, you ain't gotta be scared to fuck
If you want head, then prepare to suck (do it)
Even if the nigga don't care to nut
For every stroke, it's a hundred bucks
Respect the game, you just a slut
So open your legs up and get my duck

[Hook: Eminem (Dina Rae)]
You just a .. (ho)
You just my .. (ho)
Dirty-ass .. (ho)
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch

Go get my .. (dough)
Go bring me my .. (dough)
Dirty-ass .. (ho)
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch

[Verse 2: Proof]
I don't spit game, no longer than my name
The way my chain hang, my nuts do the same
Don't pay pussy, pussy pay me
Bitch, slut, whore or lady (yup)
And knowing the fact, I was born to mack
That's why I got a ho in the back, blowing my sac
Got good game, that's a hood thang
What'd you brang, loot or poo-tang?
Let 'em all bang, run that cheese
Tell that trick nigga (come back please!)
Rob a L7, that's a square
You a bottom ho, you got to know
Off you I plan to make a lot of dough
So suck fast bitch, and swallow slow
{​​*swish-slap-swish*}​​ (AH!) Bitch quit talking back
{​​*swish-slap-swish*}​​ (AH!) Now walk the track

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I don't pay for ass, you pump my gas
You get slapped when we're short of cash
I get whiplash when I hit the gas
And I holla out the window of the hatch
Where's my scratch? Bitch, that's, it
Suck it stroke it make me rich
As a token of my appreciation it's
Another client for you to hit
I don't give a fuck if you gotta go home to the kids
You shoulda picked another occupation, trick
Now you're stuck with me, fuck with me
And I'mma slap you up in this truck
You must be out your mind or something
Crying and whining like you tired or something
Go suck some head until it aches for buffering
You don't work? You make nothing
I'm just another case of a lazy husband

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I want the paper stack
Buy you an outfit, then take it back
When you page me, bitch, I never page you back
You only act a certain way that I make you act (whattup)
Hoes recognize, and niggas do too
Cause they realize that niggas do shoot
Don't like a chick that act too cute
Bitch hold my gat down when I shoot hoop (oh yeah)
And don't be asking me, all kind of questions
All harassing me, calling stressing
Or I may have to release some aggression
Beat you to death and teach you a lesson
Looking for handouts like you my damn spouse
Pull your pants down and fuck my mans now
Shut your damn mouth or get in the damn house
Off with the damn blouse and suck on my damn crotch

[Hook]
You just a .. (ho)
You just my .. (ho)
Dirty-ass .. (ho)
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch
Go get my .. (dough)
Go bring me my .. (dough)
Dirty-ass .. (ho)
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
Sell that pussy
Sell that pussy, bitch
Get out there and switch and go make Bizarre rich
You gotta itch, you fucking dirty bitch
Now get on the corner, and start sucking some dicks
Niggas want pussy, and I need cash
So mom, get out there and start selling yo' dirty ass
Bizarre quick to hit 'em, and then stick 'em
Fuck it; I'll let you hear one of my victims:
("Somebody help! I'm on 7 Mile and...")
Shut up bitch, you talk too much!
Now you about to get fucked in your dirty butt!
You never seen a pimp like me, out here whoring
Shut your fucking mouth and you'll be out by the morning
Cause I'm the dirtiest pimp, you ever heard of
Give me my five-thousand, and take this cheeseburger (bitch!)
Go suck dick at a bachelor party
So what if you on your period? blood never hurt nobody

[Hook]
You just a .. (ho)
You just my .. (ho)
Dirty-ass .. (ho)
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch
Go get my .. (dough)

Dirty-ass .. (ho)

[Eminem (Dina Rae)]
You just a .. (ho)

You just a, dirty ass bitch
A dirty ass, nasty ass, stinky ass, filthy ass, stanky ass bitch
(Oooh, ooh-OOOH) Hahahahaha... (lahhh-aHHH)
But I love you... (hahaha) .. Kim (mmm)

[Outro: Rondelle Beene]
And there you have it god damnit, the fundamentals of pimping
You heard it here first, from the Dirtiest Dozen
You ever seen in yo' god damn life
Yo this is Rondell Beene on the scene
And we keep the pussyholes smiling, because we always wilding
YouknowhatI'msayin? Fuck all what everybody else talking about
We let you know right here
Big pimping, it ain't dead, we love getting head, in a dirty-ass bed
That's just what we do
You know we was throwing heroin pimp parties back in 1968
The pussy is all great
I'll see you at eight, bitch



[Intro: Proof]
[?]

[Verse 1: Proof]
Aiyyo, she a freak and I love the way she move to the beat
Ass and titties bouncin, she ain't movin her feet
Put 20 in her bra, stiff dick had many in her jaw
Probably hit plenty in the raw (nasty bitch)
I wanna see this bitch naked on my livin room flo'
And yo bitch, I ain't givin up no dough, fo'sho'
You can be my best friend but Em might get mad
Don't call me Daddy bitch, I fuck better than your dad
Let me get up in that ass like I'm ridin horseback
Fuck a sponge, I need a tool to clean my ball sack
I pop my collar, don't pop your bra strap
If you hang up the phone then bitch don't call back
18's on ice, you ain't seen that befo'
Actin like you ain't seen my bling through the do' (bling)
I move to a ho, just for one reason
Cause bitches need 9-1-1 for no reason

[Chrous: Proof & Eminem]
I'm somethin like a pimp
A diamond eyed trick, but you ain't seein no chips, young ho

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I never treat 'em like they wanna be treated, bitch beat it
Your purpose'll be defeated if you think that you're needed
Now what do you tell a chick who has two black eyes?
You ain't gotta tell her nothin, you just told her twice
And I don't wanna put my hands on ya, I got a plan for ya
Get with my mans, he gon' lay a couple grand on ya
So fresh and so clean, she know the routine
It's such a - wonderful thing, money flow like ravines
They say "Kuniva, get a clothin line" but I'mma chill
Cause when cotton ain't sellin pussy always will
And these women they be knowin the deal
That's why these niggas be blowin a mil' just to keep a ho in they grill
And I ain't never been a pimp, I'm somethin like one though
I fuck 'em and leave 'em, you always love or like that ho
Cashin 'em out, they never get ahold of my chains
They only get that swollen up thang, I'm showin 'em game

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]
Hah, you was a sucka when you met her, she dogged you cause you let her
See I tell a bitch quick, if you knew better you'd do better (bitch)
They realizin I ain't havin that shit
Don't be surprised, I'm hypnotizin every tramp that she with
I send 'em out like Vanity 6 and I mean that
I'm doggin they ass, I'm in joggin pants and a V-neck (hah!)
I put my foot up in her ass so fast
That she'll forget how to spell "cash," she ho'in with a cast on
And I'm knowin just what happened that day
He didn't pay cause you let him take you to a matinee (I saw you)
You get slapped that way, you can't dodge the drama
I'm pimpin aunts and mamas, I collect from massage parlors (want my change)
Menage-a-trois is really second nature
I have 88 bitches straight takin it to the face {AHH!}
And uh, I can give a fuck about a relation
Either open your legs, or get the play, stupid bitch

[Chrous: Proof & Eminem]
I'm somethin like a pimp

Said I'm somethin like a pimp

[Verse 4: Eminem]
(Hey, you know I gotta say somethin on this track)
Well I'm not a pimp or a player, see I'm more like the mayor
Grab a bitch up by her hair like I just don't care
And swing her in the air (AHH!) I'm talkin major ass kick
Toss a bitch out the house like Kwame Kirkpatrick
I'm a PIMP, so I give a fuck about a BITCH
But I don't make 'em trick, I'm RICH (whoo!)
I don't need the chips, they don't walk the strip
But I could spit some game and I could talk some shit
I'm somethin like a pimp, similar to a mack
I ain't makin the news, I make my baby mama pick up the slack
Drop Cadillac, truck {*phone rings*} fuck, I gotta go
That's my bottom ho pagin me back - I'm a pimp

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
It's 7 o'clock, bitch you ain't got my money?
I'mma beat yo' ass {*girl giggles*} you think it's funny?
Bitch get on the block in some dirty tube socks
And get shot by a cop in some Reeboks (yeah!)
Bitch I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Keep suckin dick, 'til you get a hundred grand
Bitch you insane if you think I'm your mayn
Here's 2 G's, go fuck LeBron James

[Chrous: Proof & Eminem]
A diamond eyed trick, but you ain't seein no chips, young ho

[Intro: Bizarre and Swifty]
Yeah, welcome to Amityville (Detroit, nigga!)
The reason why rappers gotta pack pistols (Why is that?)

[Hook: Eminem]
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this tool
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Background]
Ain't going nowhere without my gun
I walk the streets I pack my gun
I go to sleep I got my gun
Don't go nowhere without my gun

[Verse 1: Swifty]
Nigga, we violently active, so fuck with us
See I'm backwards, I slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for asking, they musta been wanting to meet the Lord
When my parents talked to me, they got mean mugged and ignored
They were snooping through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the 44 scattered over they porch
Busting pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryna break your neck to conversate? Bitch, I'll do it for you
Catch me laughing at your funeral when they lower you
You and your ho, you gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow for any nigga we'll shower you
We young strapped and powerful and I ain't gotta lie to you

[Verse 2: Proof]
Stepped in the door, waving the fo'-fo'
Blazing at po-po, escaping and lay low
They call my tongue ya-yo, but I spit fire
I lit five inside a fucking dick-rider
The clip slider, love to blast a Mag
You a fag, you love being ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta (Now that's gangsta)
Y'all niggas sound like Jigga but act like 'Pac
Yo my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touching the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I'm bluffing for fame?
I'll squeeze off this tec until nothing remains

[Hook: Eminem]
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this two
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
The only time that I'm at peace is when I'm close to one
Cause I don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
That's why I'm heated, you never know who starts creeping
Waking you up with AK's while you lie sleeping
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it
Rather than need one and not have it, I married this Glock-matic

[Eminem]
Nowhere without my..

[Verse 4: Kon Artis]
You know the sound when I'm spinning round
Spitting these rounds from four pounds
While the whole crowd screaming as loud
From they mouths as they possibly allow?
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Aerial somersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry the nine where I go
Bullets whistle and hit you while I'm shooting at 5-0
Some semi-automatic for static's the motto
Spitting like *Columbine kids* from Colorado

[Hook: Eminem]
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this two
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
This nine'll turn a softy to a hard rock
It'll make Jehovah's Witnesses, think before they knock (Sorry, sorry!)
It'll make your grandmother come outta her purse
It'll make Limp Bizkit, get rid of Fred Durst
It'll make Holyfield start fighting
It'll make Mase say fuck church and go back to writing
It'll make Shyne say he sound like Biggie Smalls
It'll make R. Kelly, give respect to Aaron Hall
It'll make Christopher Reeves start walking
It'll make a dog with no voice, suddenly start barking
It'll make a nun turn to a filthy slut
It'll make the hardest pitbull, turn to a fucking mutt
It'll make a Muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make a redneck start to read the Holy Qu'ran (Need Jesus!)
It'll make Ike stop beating Tina
It'll make Slim Shady fall back in love with Christina

[Hook: Eminem]
Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this two
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Outro]
Swifty: Hah, nigga, nigga you better have aim, cause if you don't - you're finished
Eminem: Sorry officers
Swifty: Flat out
Bizarre: Detroit
Eminem: Sorry *cops*, fuckin' *pigs*
Bizarre: The fuck we stay at
Swifty: Fuck around and get popped, with no hesitation, straight up
Bizarre: Look where the fuck we stay at, nigga look where the fuck we stay at. Fuck around with us.. You get us popped.. Fucking get us popped... Ahahaha you get us popped!



[Eminem]
O. Trice, c'mon!

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, niggas got me
I'mma get them, it ain't over

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice (yeah!)
Then I'm popping the clip, bout to fix this issue (woo!)
You pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you (no!)
You're gonna need an ambulance to stitch your tissue (nigga!)
Or either have a bag on your hip to shit through (ha!)
You seen us on the ave, anxious to get you
But my penis is a mag, when I lift it hits you (DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!)
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Verse: Obie Trice]
I, solemnly swear on my, daughter's tears
The nigga that got him in the head will feel it before the year ends
(That's right) Hope you inconspicuous, my friend
Cause once the word get back, you in a world of sin (sin)
Bullets will hurdle at him, for trying to murder what's
Been determined as the first solo African (me!)
To go platinum with an accident happening
Well maggots I'm alive with vengeance to get back (get back!)
My momma blood pressure was affected from that
My little girl need her daddy on the phone at a certain time
Exact now, and niggas act wild (foul)
But when the mac come out, y'all niggas exile (blaow!)
And I don't wanna hear X-Y-Z
I'm X'ing out your whole entity for trying to kill me (me nigga)
Filthy motherfuckers, I'll show you what real be (real be nigga)
When these HTB's light up your kidneys (woo!)
I'm so sincere, you see in a hearse this year
It's not a verse it's a curse from birth and what's on your person over here
This is Obie hear him clear, niggas beware
We're coming at you with firearms in air (yeah nigga!)
And your purpose so superfluous
How could I be merciful when murking me's a mercenary's goal? (uh)
Nigga I got paper, I'll have ya ass urgently exposed (what!)
No emergency's bringing back your souls
Slugs shatter your bones for pat-patting me in the dome
Learn this patter-in, we catch him at home, he wrong
That's when automatics sporadically catch him in the abdomen
Another dirty motherfucker's gone (YEAH!)

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice (yeah!)
Then I'm popping the clip, bout to fix this issue (woo!)
You pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you (no!)
You're gonna need an ambulance to stitch your tissue (nigga!)
Or either have a bag on your hip to shit through (ha!)
You seen us on the ave, anxious to get you
But my penis is a mag, when I lift it hits you (DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!)
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[Outro: Obie Trice]
"Second Round's on Me" (robbin, shootin, killin, murder)
Oh shit RUNNN! (robbin, shootin, killin, murder)



{*guns cocking then one gunshot*}

[Eminem] Haha
[Ca$his] Ca$his, Ca$his
[Eminem] Yeah!
[Ca$his] King Mathers
[Eminem] C'MON!
[Ca$his] Pistol poppin, come get me nigga! {*echoes*}

[Hook: Ca$his]
Pistol poppin, bodies droppin, layin all around
You thought it was a game, now the neighbors callin out
The police find that, what's that sound?
While you layin on the ground with your fuckin brain out

[Ca$his]
Walk through the door with my hands on a gun
Cause niggas 'round here wanna ask where I'm from
I throw up my signs, step back and pop one
'fore you throw up your sign if you even got one
I used to bust niggas heads open for fun
Chase him down, stomp him out, if he tried to run
I could flip packs, get stacks, big straps, where it at?
Slung crack, real cat, you ain't never did that
Go hard, no peace, I gotta keep, chrome heat
I don't sleep, homie I'm watched by the police
Cops out patrolling, grab a Glock-40
Sniper at the squad car, story noting
Fuck it if you want beef, click-clack, wack rap
Tossed straps before, I'm out of here, homie
Militant in a sense, I don't really give a shit
Call up, Eminem, I gotta plead innocent

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
Sixteenth in my sneakers, I ain't listen to my teachers
I'm the most hated nigga alive, since Jesus
Maybe in the afterlife they'll reveal my Christ-like abilities
Come back, then ride on my enemies
Never been afraid of beef, metals of my bravery
War situations got you sayin he, crazy G
And emerge with the beat, I can serve anything
Especially anybody tryin to diss my team - Shady
{*blam*} G-Unit, Aftermath the same thing
So if you say them punk nigga you say me
I be in L.A. G, get at me when you see me
Catch you in O.C., and in the bag you'll be leaving
I ain't worried 'bout my freedom cause for me to get even
Is worth e'rything, it's on B.B.G.N
I son'd you folk, I'm lookin at your pinkie
You a fake-ass gangsta, what a waste of my scenery

[Hook] - 2X

[Eminem]
Lately I just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
Shady (Ca$his) we gotta push 'em to the back
Move 'em along, push 'em aside, don't get me wrong
I love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
It's got a catch but come on man, the raps
We all gotta step our game up; especially these lame fucks
Who walk around with their chest out
Just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
Better be down with them, huh
But I dare some bitch to say somethin about, Eminem
Cause I'm not in the mood to be playin around with dudes
I already seen two friends get shot in the head
And lay on the ground this year and, one didn't make it
Proof, you are the truth
Please don't let us come face to face with these boo-boo-hoo
Fake-ass tattooed havin
Fif' please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
For me to try and, stay out it
But they just won't quit runnin their mouth
At least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch!
We all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?
And as far as the snaps and claps, I wasn't
Dissin the South, that isn't what this is about
I just so sick of the beef, I don't even wanna see anymore

[Hook] - 2X



[Intro]
Yeah, Shady
Aftermath
G-Unit!

[Chorus]
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you (Come on)
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me (Not me, nigga)
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you

[Verse 1]
You mistakin' me for somebody that you should be testin'
You should be stressin', I'm finna fuckin' teach you a lesson (Yeah)
Rap 101's in session, Em laced the track that I'm blessin'
Smith & Wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin', escape lesson (God, damn)
Cappin' 'em, kept in my Benz, hot beginnin' to end (Woo)
Watch the 22's spin, my hoes they perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best, don't you get it? Forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in yo' ass, bitch!
If it's not a classic, when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered, stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard
When measures get drastic, Glocks made out of plastic
Cock it, aim it, blast it, run nigga, now stash it (Come on)

[Chorus]
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you

[Bridge]
If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
I'ma drink 'til I get to that bitch
Em and Dre gonna introduce me to the 'burbs
They gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit (Break it down!)

[Verse 2]
Picture a perfect picture, picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me startin' shit, picture me bustin' my gat
Picture police mad, they ain't got a picture of that
Picture me bein' broke, picture me smokin' a stack
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me goin' back
To my momma basement to live, shit, picture that
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target, Jack (Huh-uh)
Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back
50 Cent, too much Henny, man I'm bent, I'm outta here

[Chorus]
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you

[Outro]
Ha-ha, man, I ain't' goin' to jail, not even to visit a nigga
You wanna holler at me, you write me
Matter of fact, you gotta send it to Sunset Boulevard up in the Mondrian (Ha-ha-ha)
Ridin' 'round in one of Dre's Ferraris, nigga
Oh, matter fact, I might be in Detroit ridin' down 8 Mile Road
You know, to one of Em's joints and shit (Ha-ha)
Ya heard? I got places to go, man, you know
Shady/Aftermath, we finna start printin' money (He-he-he-he)
Puttin' Em's face on these motherfuckin' bills, shit (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
Ain't shit you can do about it



[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Fuck the whole world man, we are the freshest
I'm higher than a baby on a seesaw with Precious
Y'all just the messengers, we are the message
You bang on wax, I beef off the record
Rap like I trap, you can't spit this flow
I slang water, slang flour, I'ma get this dough
Behind my zipper where her lipstick go
Like an embryo in a hooker, I'm in this ho

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Nickel!
Right off the rip, nigga we are the dopest
Y'all in front of the camera, we are the focus
Y'all are the watered down, we are the potent
Y'all call y'all bosses, we call the GOAT then
We ball fo' sho' and, here we are fast cats, fly
Me and bombs over baghdad: B.o.B
The only thing I hate to see is hate
In the place to be

[Chorus: B.o.B]
What an incredible place to be
Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes, surrounded by money
What about nines and super freaks?
Bottle of patron, just roll that green
Put it down for the team
So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot
What an incredible place to be

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I'm feeling like Cassius, at last it's the greatest
Angry intelligent rap, mad innovative
Y'all blast garbage shit, we blast the haters
Hip Hop's a community, we smack the neighbors
The last men standing when the shit get real
When the rest up we stepped up like a 6 inch heel
I'm getting used to how this rich shit feel
But don't judge me, I'm doing my best to make my dick sit still

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Fresh in the strip club, he be the realest
The drugs got her numb, but she feel this
I said I need a lover for an hour, not anything like a spouse
Told her the roof's missing, but everything's on the house
Got a table full of liquor, somethings gotta hit the spot
She might even put them on the glass if we mix a lot
Get her nice and buzzed
The night'll end when we decide it does

[Chorus: B.o.B]
What an incredible place to be
Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes, surrounded by money
What about nines and super freaks?
Bottle of patron, just roll that green
Put it down for the team
So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot
What an incredible place to be

[Verse 5: B.o.B]
You already know nigga, we be's the flyest
You might've seen high, but nigga we get the highest
Far as lighters, I need at least a 3 week supply with
Now all this pussy thrown at me, now I'm knee deep in 'gina
Bitch I'm bossin', fuck around and unleash Goliath
I go deep and get your poon all wet, call me Poseidon
I'm a giant, I eat beats and I burn good, that's my diet
B.o.B and Slaughterhouse 5

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
Nine, every time I scribble a rhyme down
Niggas be like (that's a riot)
Crooked, Ortiz, sick with the flow (that's a riot)

[Verse 6 Cont.: Joe Budden]
Or explosive, know it be like Floetry
So it's Ambrosis, I wrote it, know that it's cool to quote it
Joe!

[Verse 6 Cont.: Joell Ortiz]
L one hell of a relevant MC, felon ya melon is empty
So elementary, benevolency resides inside our pens, C

[Verse 6 Cont.: Crooked I]
R, double O-K, E-D-I
Far up and away, cause we be high

[Chorus: B.o.B]
What an incredible place to be
Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes, surrounded by money
What about nines and super freaks?
Bottle of patron, just roll that green
Put it down for the team
So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot
What an incredible place to be
Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes, surrounded by money
What about nines and super freaks?
Bottle of patron, just roll that green
Put it down for the team
So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot
What an incredible place to be



[Verse 1: Chaos Kid]
Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as hell
Went to use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell
All the way downstairs onto the couch
And I pissed my pants on the way down south
So I went back upstairs to change my underwear
Took a while to get em unstuck from my pubic hair
Finally got unzipped I went to put em down the street
But then I threw em in the garbage cause it all said pew
Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair
Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there
That damn toilet it must of went foul
Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel
Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash
So I sat and played some Mario on my Nintendo
I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff man today
I just feel like a pooh butt...

[Hook-2x]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feeling like a pooh butt today

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Now every single day I make habits to get up
But today I just feel like a pooh butt so ill stay in bed
I dont know whats wrong with me, I'm just taking everything nonchalantly
I just feel like I can't move one muscle
My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle
My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8
It's 7:15 looks like I'm gonna be late
Aww forget that baby said I just can't make it
I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it
I'm sick in bed I'm making [?] foot it but before hung up the phone she told me where I could put it
Comes next day I got a call from M&M he said
(We gotta make a record get ya butt outta bed) I said I ain't doin nothing I wish you nothing but luck he said (What's up?) I said I feel like a pooh but...

[Hook]
Sometimes things just never go my way you know i, im just feelin like a pooh butt today

[Break]
(Chaos Kid) "yo you ever have one of those poohie stinky ridiculous rotten days, M&M" (M&M) "man I had one once check this out"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Woke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning
Gotta get to the recording studio
I gotta get a take done
Put all my rhymes together so I can make one
Get outta bed, fall on my head
Slipped on the rug, I thought I was dead
Cussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing
Only a concussion, shake it off, get off the ground
Look around couldn't find my rhyme sheets; Where'd I put em down?
They were just there last night on the chair
Had to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere
Go to the basement might of misplaced em
Gotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry
Goin' down the stairs what could happen next
But, when its this early you can't skip steps;
Fallin head first -- As I fall, I curse
Things are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse;
Aching I shake and I hurt I stand up slowly
Wiped all the dirt off memory lapse
I can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse
If you forget the whole thing pause for a second
What was I looking for? Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets
They might be on the floor or on the chair
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
Damn, how does time fly? Think for a second
Record my memory if I were a rhyme sheet where would I be??
Now I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket
So I woulda never lost em
Already seven, I've only got an hour to eat breakfast
Get dressed, plus take a shower got undressed
Got the zest off the rack
Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack;
Cold as hell, started to yell jumped out the shower
And said fuck it, I'll smell
Grabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed
Still had to eat but my hair was a mess
I was in a rush, grabbed the brush
And ran into the door on the floor I land
Always to fate now; I know I'm cursed
I think it might help if I open the door first
Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist
But that's what happens on a day like this...

[Hook]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feelin' like a pooh butt today

[Break]
(Chaos Kid): Wow, that sounds pretty poohie to me

(M&M): Now, I'm gonna break it downfor those who don't know what a pooh butt day is

[Outro: Eminem]
Now, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had
No particular depression neither mad or sad
You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is
Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt
Then you're feeling like shit



[Verse 1]
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?
My watch saying "Hi shorty, we can be friends"
My whip saying "Quit playing, bitch, get in"
My earring saying "We can hit the mall together"
Shorty, it's only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things, y'all niggas, y'all know my style
Your wrist "bling bling", my shit "bling blaow"
My pinky ring talk, it say "Fifty, I'm sick"
That's why these niggas is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits
Flex my man he gon' bump my shit
See I'm a liar, man, I really don't care
I tell them hoes whatever they wanna hear
You tryna play me, Imma blaze ya then
My cross cost more than the crib ya mamma raised ya in

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 2]
New York niggas copy niggas like it's all good
Fuck around, we crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama
I'm from NY whoady, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, niggas go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, roll out, I'm done
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump
Don't make me hit ya up, these shells will split ya up
I lay you down, the coroners will come and get ya up
See 50 play for keeps and 50 stay with heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real gutta, man; the hood love me, man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bruh man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
CO screaming "Shut the fuck up!" in the bing

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 3]
I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe or Vette, I tear up the highway
Shorty'll tell ya I'm 'bout my dick-game
But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed
These young boys, they done got they own work, man

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga



[Intro: DJ Salam Wreck]
DJ Salam Wreck!

[Proof]
This is me, this is you
This is us, this is Proof
This is you, this is me
This is us, this is Proof
I don’t need forgiveness
I don’t need no religion
I ain’t living my life behind bars or sign Prison
Ain't no job for me
Damn if God only put some love in my house insteada leavin’ mah heart lonely
Trapped inside poverty
Strapped up so properly
Actin' outta hunger
Now I’m wrapped up in robberies
My yearn is to brawl
Got me learnin' the law
Came to school
But a fool
I ain’t turning my jaw (shhh-it)
Hit me? I’m hitting back
Damn sho I’m getting back
Tough behind the streets
Never eat where you shittin’ at
Life as a diplomat
True family and friends
Sittin' back confused, insanity begins
As we travel to the end
And battle not the sick (whut)
Being broke, Harry had his Gat up to his skin
Used to live to fight
Now I’m fightin’ to live
Please believe my own needs
Feed mah wife and mah kids
[Outro]
It’s my life
-We do what we gotta do
Can only do me
-That’s all I know how to do
I gotta get away
-To swallow this Malibu
So pray for me
-‘Cos my life ain't valuable
It’s my life
-We do what we gotta do
Can only do me
-That’s all I know how to do
I gotta get away
-To swallow this Malibu
Straight from the bottle
-Do, shit, I do what I gotta do

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just 'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'
Pick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood 'til EMS
Come pick you up, you know you're fucked when you get on the stretcher
'Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me
They lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get, a nine, then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid
In the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard
Still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog
How late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark
I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[50 Cent]
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead
He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn

[Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub

[50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)



[Intro: Royce da 5'9"]
I guess you can consider it poetry
But with me it started out with just words, just words, words
They started looking like puzzle pieces
So I started connecting them to each other
'Til they started to resemble blank canvases
By this time I was an artist
So I just started to see these pictures
These real visuals
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer, killer, killer, killer, killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer, killer, killer, killer, killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer, killer, killer, killer, killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer

[Bridge]
Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Staring at the full moon
Did you ever think you would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off
Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick taught
'Til my inner enemy interrupts
I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams
With anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong,  and I'm standin' in front of a gun
I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard
Every award show, we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical
To a kid who wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him? (Hit him, hit him)
Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit
Before me and Shady, who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit?
We put the world onto it so watch how you say "fuck me"
You just might jinx yourself, whoops, your girl gon' do it
'Cause I was in that 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time
I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity
And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) Oh yeah
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
'Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

[Verse 2: KXNG CROOKED]
This elite drinker is the ringleader
I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher
With a street sweeper full of heat seekers
In your Jeep speakers I'ma keep ringers
I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Niggas try to tell me I spell too much
Capital S to the laugh to the T-E-R
Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word
Making work disappear quick as magic
Abracadabra, the trafficker blacker than Africa
Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood?
Money like Dracula has him a spatula, ask me a question
Am I the best with the flexing? Fuck yes with the goon talk
I just moonwalk all over the beat then I'm lightin' up the street
CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller

[Hook: Yelawolf]
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) Oh yeah
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
'Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

[Bridge]
Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Staring at the full moon
Did you ever think you would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams

[Verse 3: Eminem]
The thought of retiring is makin' me want
To set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron and
What up ma, I'm applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?
I'm hopin' to fill up your openin'
Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you're in a lobby in Ireland
And you've probably already been with all the Slaughter and I am
In no mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin
With no strings attached
I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein' brought up so wrought up inspired
But I don't know why, it's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool
Not an appliance, but applyin' this science, I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance
Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talk intertwined like a beanstalk and a vine
But I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause
In the fabric of our modern society
Now Catholics are panicking 'cause I snapped back
To my old antics and shenanigans, dammit, the Pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't've ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin
Singin' "Bagpipes from Baghdad" again
In my dad's drag, draggin' a faggot in a GLAAD bag
Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance like that again
You thought I was lyin' when I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again
I've lost my mind, caution oh God I think I just thought of another fucking line
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
But hip-hop has left me brainwashed with a violent...streak
Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet
Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer beehive colony tryin' to sneak by it
While his feet stomp, follow me while I revive rap
I'ma start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in
Boston, across the marathon finish line than to
Put your thoughts against mine
'Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life, worse than Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev with bombs, pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking Swiss army knife
A saberless Darth Vader with arthritis in a bar fight
With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
Perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
Like fuck 'em all I'm just ridin'
Like I’m locked up inside of a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car
Uncle Ronnie was driving, 'bout to burst through the side door
Of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room

[Hook: Yelawolf]
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) Oh yeah
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
'Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)



Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that

Verse 2: 2pac
(Turn the fucking lights out!)
Sick, Thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin money but you stuck on these fake bitches
I stay blunted, And never fronted and I doubt if I do
Cause if I do, Then I get beat up by my fuckin crew
A real nigga, Since you figure that you ready to box
You catchin knots from my nigga Freddie Foxxx
And I, You really don't want none from Pac
Cause I'll be strapped wit a Glock
And throw thangs like I'm born to box
I'll hit this motherfuckin gin then I'll be all in
Hell yeah, Young niggas straight ballin
And everybody wants to see if I'm a g weighin 185
And I'm high 'til I fuckin die

Refrain:

OHH! I had you yellin out when I backed a 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggas to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you can yell like other niggas, your pickin a dirty psycho
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho

Verse 3: 2pac
Walkin thru tha cemetary, talkin to my homies that was buried
Say my enemies wanna see me dead I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter calm my fears
Lifted my head from my hand that'll ball me tears
I see bodies gettin splashed with acid
2 shots ring from the plasted guy wrapped in plastic
Bury tha bastard, time to notify
His family...shiet..
Ain't nothin left to be identify
Evacuate the crime scene fast, why?
I heard the feds have a warrent fo my ass, fly
I won't touch down till I see tijauna
Setup a shop sellin them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success,i made tha switch, retired from the life that neva gave me shit
But cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars and adict fo a wife, tmy life as a ghetto star

Refrain:

OHH! I had you yellin out when I backed a 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggas to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you can yell like other niggas, your pickin a dirty psycho
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho

Verse 4: 2pac
Just holla my name
And witness game official
Niggas is so shame
They stare stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox
Gone my block
Though gun shots is promised to me when will I stop
I hit the weed
And hope to god I can fly high
Witness my enemies
Die when I ride by
They shouldn'ta tried me
Send they bodies to they parents up north
With they faces they wrists and they nuts cut off
Fuck em all what I scream as I dream in tons
Fuck a trick, get me rich n the bitches'll come
Bust ma gun make em all scatta
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatta
Eat her dead bee-yatch..mercy neva that

Verse 5: The Notorious B.I.G
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway

OHH! I had you yellin out when I backed a 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggas to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you can yell like other niggas, your pickin a dirty psycho
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho



[Intro]
Hello, what up? Hello?
Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back

[Verse]
I sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do, you can say good night
And bye-bye to them my tunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking-dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face
As I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid
Stupendous way to end this
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th
When 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the crazed lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block
In the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for them to say "touché"?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothin'
When it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one

[Intro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
There I go, thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Outro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
*Eminem burps*
Ah, damn!
Fucking bitch



[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Coo,l calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit
Ah shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb **** start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
I said come on bounce!
Everybody in the house doing mass amounts ("Me!")
To the women in the thongs with their asses out ("Oh")
We don't bull****, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Help me get her on the couch before she passes out

[Verse 2: Kuniva and Kon Artis]
Junk that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestling with Elton John
Hey Von, ya see me stepping on these leprechauns?
They gotta be Tums, the Ex-Lax is gone
Yeah, I took 'em all, dog, with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and full of ***
And I think he about to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop acting stupid; you so ****
That you might wake up with a *** on some new ****
Yeah, I think I did too much
I think I got the runs
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Watch out, here it comes

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Bridge]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other
Out and date each other
Some-, some-, some-
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'

[Verse 3: Proof]
Hop hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills, on stilts I walk
***** *** ***** that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and ****** the Hulk
I wanna **** away like a rollerblade
Until my **** **** back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
I'm 'a go for broke? No? Okey-doke
*** ******* ** **** with soap
*Coughing* Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a ***** lady
Now I'm paying child support? (It's your baby!)

[Verse 4: Swift]
I take **** ***** at one time!
And I don't need a chase when I'm swallowing mine
(Hey, ya got any room?)
In Bizarre's hatch back
We can't go far, 'cause the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it too
(Swift, chill!) - I'm just trying to get by like you!
And I don't give a damn if you find me rude
Mean crude to hell with you too
I only need three ***** and I'm cool
I just got some and I'm goin' back soon

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
I'm at a rave, lookin' at a babe
Like she want it
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Looney, crazy, jumpy, sexy, dope-headed guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses, wanna try?
**** *****, ****** *****, got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill - chick, I'm for real
Shut yo' mouth, you dirty girl!
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight, Bizarre's here all night!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Bridge]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other
Out and date each other
Some-, some-, some-
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'



[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit
Ah shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
*Gunshots* I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce ("me!")
Not weed, I meant coke; dumb-ass, sit down! ("oh.")
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch before she crashes out

[Verse 2: Kuniva and Kon Artis]
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It got to be acid 'cause the X is gone
Yeah, I took 'em all, dog, with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he about to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
Yeah, I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills that's ill – mescaline

[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

[Bridge: Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other
Out and date each other
Some-, some-, some-
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'

[Verse 3: Proof]
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for dope to smoke? No? Okey-doke
I'm packin' my nose with coke
*Coughing* Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a whore lady
Now I got to strangle an infant (You're crazy!)

[Verse 4: Swift]
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any shrooms?)
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs, because our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack, then I might too
(Swift, chill!) – I just want to get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums
Even smoke weed out of vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin' back soon

[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
I'm at a rave, lookin' like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope-heady guy
Heroin mescaline pencil leads, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (yeah, right) – bitch, I'm for real
Shut yo' mouth, you dirty slut!
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

[Intro]
The Incredible Hulk-
And he brought me- He brought [?]
You- you gotta- [?]
And he- he [?]ed a bot so he could [?] me around and drive
Man, you don't even know what time it is
I saw this mad pimp daddy walkin' down the street, with incredible, [?], Bellbottom, tight, purple pants
I'm talkin' about tight-

[Hook]
Tight, pimp, saga, purple pants
Tight, pimp, saga, purple pants

[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you about these purple pants that he was wearing
They sagged down his feet and they kept on dragging
Down on the ground when he walked with them
It looked like bellbottoms, and they were my friend
They were bellbottoms, purple pants
Worn by a pimp and he did that dance
Had [fish for?] high heels and he strutted [?] tall
Walked like a pimp and he did this thing, we call
Rhymin', He rhymed all the time
But not in a rap, he liked to sing all the time
He liked to sing about bitches
Strawberry alarm clocks and ditches
That dog's dig
Just like my dog Spot, you know he's a bitch
He tried to fuck me, I said no
He fucked the beat up, and I'm on the go

[Hook]
Purple, pimp, saga, err, pants
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants

[Verse 2]
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants
Worn by Incredible Hulk
The punk who thinks he's bad
Really cause he knows that he's really sad
He came up in my face with a big green grin
I said, "Homeboy, don't you think I'm gonna spin
On my head, like a breakdancer?"
I said, "No,"
I punched him in the jaw, and I broke his [?]
It's called spooky
Spooky
And the chorus will go just like this
Yo homeboy don't ever diss cause he's a-

[Hook]
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants
Purple, pimp, saga, bellbottom pants
And that's the end



[Part I: Quitter]

[Intro 1: Eminem]
Yo, I dedicate to this to you
To all my fans, keeping y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and
Which I create, cause that's my mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, cause I get respect, I bet you
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, "Heck, country western rap records are good"
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin to hear some fucking old fart in a chair
Sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your fucking chest 'til your heart kicks in gear
And fuck your underground buddies' nameless crew
Like I'mma say they names so they can be famous too

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
You just a Quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke
And I'mma tell these motherfuckin' fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you, bitch, I had a show to do
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two
Back in '94 Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin' DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
Mr.-Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap quicker
But never last, and Everlast is a

[Chorus: Eminem]
Quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight look, so this is what we ask of our fans
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a ho, bitch-slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin
Shit in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets

[Interlude 1: Eminem]
Ayo, fuck this, cut this shit off
Ayo Head
That's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker

[Part II: Hit 'Em Up (Remix)]

[Intro 2: Eminem]
Kill Whitey (hahaha!)
Kill Whitey, Detroit
Kill Whitey, yo, yo
Kill Whitey, haha, look

[Verse 4: Eminem]
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, 40 and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin while you runnin' out of breath
Steady duckin' while I'm punchin' at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CDs nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MCs
You ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha!
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know

[Chorus 2: Eminem]
Grab .380s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up

[Interlude 2: Eminem]
Hahaha, yo check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'mma let D12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin' back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaurant, while I'm servin' ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'mma beat your ass while they watch

[Verse 6: Kuniva]
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? It's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the muhfuckin' Belle Isle Bridge

[Chorus 2: Eminem]
Grab .380s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin' killed
With his chest open, tryin to throw a fuckin' punch
But you just chokin', having a stroke
And now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
Cause you suck, motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin' about you packin' pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whippin' tail
Erik, remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious, you probably was gay
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
49,000 copies the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
2.5 million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit em up

[Verse 8: Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got a Uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated, you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Erik's irons get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

[Verse 9: Swifty]
What the fuck, is you stupid? I choke Whitey Ford
With his fucking guitar cord and stuff him in cardboard
Chopped up in a box, with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
Cause we hit 'em up like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur

[Verse 10: Eminem]
You a, Black Jesus, heart attack, seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, ayo cut this shit off
Sheeeit! Fuck him!
That's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done
That's it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kicking a man while he's down
Goddamn! I quit!
Mention my daughter's name in a song again, you fucking punk Ayo!



[Verse]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
Instead of always trying to swallow it
Instead of staring at this wall and shit
While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealing with another fucking politic
I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feeling at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
[rip] I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped up, wait, here comes somethin'
[crumples paper] Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fucking boiling point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawing someone
By the way they're running, you would swear the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back, baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance I grab it — Rabbit, run!



[Hook]
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and
Everybody seems to lost their mind
It's hard to handle, so I change the channel on the
Radio... 'Cause internet killed the radio star
Radio... And YouTube killed the video star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star

[Verse 1]
Picture me rollin' Pac, it's funny how time has changed
Everybody's a critic now, it's all a debate on the internet wave
It used to be you and Biggie, Chili Pepper's Give It Away
Now we got ten year-olds sittin' back in a chair like "those were the days"
And though it seems so amazin' to me that the labels lost the touch
And I'm in the AM, flippin' through the A.M. like I lost my crutch
Limpin' 'cause I can't even walk straight if I can't turn it up
Sippin', I need some Gin and Juice, Snoop Dogg, I brought my cup
What's up, ah ha, okay, shut up
'Cause I think we had about enough of radios and lust with the love bugs
Well let me give you a big hug a bag of mushrooms, here, take some drugs
And play some group home or something
Shit, the Goodie Mobs Soul Food is bumpin', rewind

[Hook]
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and
Everybody seems to lost their mind
It's hard to handle, so I change the channel on the
Radio... 'Cause internet killed the radio star
Radio... And YouTube killed the video star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star

[Verse 2]
You'll never hear Black Star 'cause the program director is mostly deaf
And you'll never hear triple six 'cause we live in the midst of the Bible Belt
But that's when the light is filled, so let it shine
Let em' rhyme, let em' hustle, let em grind
Let em' roam with the truth sometimes
Sometimes, the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art
And you didn't even know you had a window till a tornado blew it apart
If Eric Clapton could sing about cocaine, then there's no harm
Then I can write about guns, I can rap about girls
I can sing about money and cars
Not that my money is large
Let's talk about broke is a joke
Let's talk about gettin' evicted
Everything you owned thrown out on the road
And maybe that there goes gold
Shit maybe it’s platinum sold
But they don't want to see the green leaves from the pirates' gold
Oh no, hold up, rewind

[Hook]
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and
Everybody seems to lost their mind
It's hard to handle, so I change the channel on the
Radio... 'Cause internet killed the radio star
Radio... And YouTube killed the video star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star

[Verse 3]
Pick up the change, pick up the change
Ride in a Chevy 'cause I'm sick of the Range
Catfish Billy come pick up the name
Come on inside, if you're sick of the rain
Turn the radio off and don't complain
It's all a replay, it's all the same
Got one drag, on a runaway train
On a one way street, better pick your lane
Yeah, but you could let me pick your brain
And we could be that Rolling Stone
Mix 'em up with Janis Joplin
And let 'em harmonize like Bone
Or we could just leave it alone
And let it take on a life of its own
Or we could be that World Class Wreckin' Cru
And tell 'em to turn the lights back on
C'mon

[Hook]
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and
Everybody seems to lost their mind
It's hard to handle, so I change the channel on the
Radio... 'Cause internet killed the radio star
Radio... And YouTube killed the video star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star



[Intro]
Eminem
Slim Shady
Representing Detroit, you know what I'm sayin'
With my man DJ Yooter, Dirty Dozen shit
What y'all know about Dirty Dozen shit
Shout out to [?]

[Verse]
Distorted, ordered by the court to be aborted
Snorted, right before these vocals were recorded
Morbid, too perverted
Stay alerted
Went to the club, murdered the first slut that flirted
Deserted, abandoned by my mama and it hurted
The worst nut my daddy ever squirted
Screamin, cussin, buzzin when I'm bustin, open sores pussin
I need another dose of Robitussin
Fussin over nothing
An army couldn't calm me
Bitching like a lady
Shady like a palm tree
What the fuck you call me, who you calling soft?
I'm still fresher than you and bitch I'm fallin off
I'm horny, and corny girls won't even cross my path
I'm so dirty, I don't even wash my ass
Never took a shower, cower from a scower
Prowler, clean your house out in half an hour
What's your flavor, how you want it, ripe or sour?
Rifle power
Snipe you from the Eiffel Tower
Too much weed, I'm bout to malfunction
Style's drunken, carjacking Al Duncan
Slim Shady, peace

[Verse]
Spray and wreck, with my man Sway & Tech
Freestylin' on the mic, rappers ain't know what's comin' next
Yo, I'm in a 'Vette breakin' necks
Cashin' checks, whiplashin' necks, smashin' decks
Freestyle right off the top, rappers ain't ready
Cut 'em like a machete
The Freddy of rap, hold it steady
Bustin' rhymes off the top of the dome wit' a popular poem
Forget a team, man, I can stop you alone
Killin' rappers, rappers ain't ready for the way I do it

[Lost Verse]
Fluent when I be kickin' these rhymes, ain't nothin' to it
'Cause I be bustin' 'em
Rappers ain't ready, ain't got no stamina
And I be bustin' rhymes on Sway & Tech in front of the camera
Damage ya like Ja Rule
Hey you, I'll mess up your debut
Rappers ain't ready for the way you can't save you
They can't save you, you're gone, you're finished
You're done, you're diminished
Rappers will never replenish
'Cause I'm Infinite, and when I step in it
In a minute, I'ma kill it when I bust rhymes
Rappers ain't ready, 'cause I don't feel it
Yo...



[Intro]
Yo, yo
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Aight, aight (huh)
Slim Shady
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an a cappella that'll chop a fella
To mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eatin' a full course meal watchin' you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feedin' you liquid darvocet
Pumpin' you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receivin' with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream, "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

[Outro]
Motherfucker
Slim Shady, bitch
Recognize
For the 99
I'm on February 23rd



[Verse]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fuckin' head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowin' up your house killin' your parents
And comin' back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker!



[Intro]
Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope
Definitely
Definitely K-Mart
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extents if any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological
Nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths, this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super-man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 2]
Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
As long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say and what not to say
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (What up?)
I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But, but, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 3]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
Goddammit Dre, where's the God damned beat (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And zoom, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no God damned sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you, "Hi, my name is"
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Outro]
'Cause ah ha ha ha ha
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope beat maker
2000, 2400 and 87 million, 900 and se-73,400 and 63... and 70
(Yeah)



[Intro: Boogie]
Nigga, I wear fur coats in the summer, nigga
Wife beaters in the winter, damn
Uh, shit

[Chorus: Boogie]
I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

[Verse 1: Boogie]
Yo, yo, aw, man
Yo, word to the titles
So word to my idols and word to the GOATs (Uh)
I ain't sayin' I like 'em
I'd kill all them niggas and wear 'em as coats (Uh)
Word to the feelings I channel
I lose 'em as quick as a fuckin' remote (Uh)
Don't be callin' me woke (No)
I cheat on my queen for a ho
That's how shit go, she keep sayin' we jell (Ayy)
She gon' come out her shell (Woah)
Ain't no pushin' my buttons
When all of my feelings is stuck on "oh, well" (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm thirsty and blessed (Ayy)
I pour liquor in grails (Woah)
This for my niggas in jail, wrestlin' L's (Uh)
That's that hell in the cell
I come from a place where the shit can get shady
My chances were slim (Ayy)
All my women was basic
We see different races since signing to Em (Yeah)
I can't send out no message to none of my exes
And bitches as friends (Ayy)
I can't blow it again
Need a bitch that's as thick as my skin, shit 'cause

[Chorus: Boogie]
I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I left my legacy hurt? Fuckin' absurd
Like a shepherd havin' sex with his sheep, fuck what you heard
All this talk in my ear, I got a idea
Like the clerk when you tryna buy beer (ID ya)
Since on the mic, I'm a nightmare
Fuck it, I thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye
I got the bottle of NyQuil right here (Right here)
You want the sleep me to wake, you want Slim Shady EP
That's on the CD cover, sockin' my mirror (Sockin' my mirror)
I promise not to cry crocodile tears (Crocodile tears)
If you end up shocked at my lyrics (Shocked at my lyrics)
Marshall is dead in the water, but not that I care
Dre said, "Rock the boat" and the Doc is my peer
So, it's unanimous, you're at attention, the planet's listenin'
And their banana splits again, which has its advantages
But when you got nothing to say except for the hand your dick is in
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickinson
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin' in, it's havin' you panic-stricken
You're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin' to autograph a picture
Then ripped it in half and whipped it at him
And kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan
But no matter how many rounds or if I get knocked down
In a bout and fell to the ground
I got a fighter's mentality, I'll get back up and fight with it
In fact, I'ma attackin' the mic with it
I'll make it sound (Sound), sound like a vampire's bitin' it (Bitin' it)
But I'd have to be Dracula's sidekick (Sidekick)
To be down for the count (Haha), yeah
Yo, album's (What?), out (Yeah), now (Uh)
Pow (Pow), wow (Woo), I don't (Huh), see no (Uh) clouds (Nah)
But ain't gon' (No) be no (Huh) drought (Uh-uh)
Smile (No), frown (Yeah), upside (Ah) down (Ya)
Shut my (Nope) mouth (Yeah), how? (How)
That ain't what (What) I'm 'bout
Shout (Shout), showers (Fuck it, ow, ow)
Thuggin', thug it out (Ow), 'cause

[Outro: Boogie]
I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just hope I never, damn (I just hope I never)
I just pray I never, fuck (I just pray I never)
I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Rainy days, uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Hang today, uh)
I need changes in a major way, a way (Major way, uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away



[Round 1: Eminem]
Aight, look! Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Tryin' to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Tryin' to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Fat and Bizarre
[…] That's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style, plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
[…]
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip into the zone
If I put banana peels around this fuckin' microphone
Go get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down
‘Cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop



Whoa Nelly, Tell Angelina Jolie I’m ready
With petroleum jelly, to smear it all over me belly
And tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly
And meet in the salami section of the grocery deli
And maybe we can find us an appropriate telly
A motel 6 or 8 it think they both could be helly
I hit it, then I quit it and I told her email me
And don’t call me, I’ll call you, can you feel me? Ho do you smell me?
Animal instinct, cannibalistic, I just ran out of lipstick, man I’m a twisted, sick
Sadistic, son of a bitch, 666, Broke his crucifix made out of sticks then fixed it
Chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick!
Now play it backwards muscle relaxers mixed with liquid
Dilaudid its diluted for a quick fix, your delusional illusions look realistic
..I Need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball, first
Off I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Oh! I'm on a roll don't get me started
Anna got pissed at me and tried to push me into the garden
With such accuracy she aims and shoots the target
Cupid's arrow done forced it...
Now look sweetheart it's the, kissing bandit
On a mission to leave Ms. Degeneres Disenchanted
By men now just listen dammit
Mr. Rossi I need no posse I single handed-
-ly will steal your heart with a kiss where should I plant it
Moi! baby its Moi! and my repertoire
Is running around in pink panties and leopard bra's
And negligah, negligée you say tomato I say tomah-to
I'm Tommy Motola Mariah don't stop me I'm on a roll
Oh!



Role Model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles and coke products if she don't suck
And ? To the bumper hit the throttle while im tryna hit the pothose
I'll freakin take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho in the porizontal getting fondeled
I don't cuddle I don't caddal
Only models that I follows
Everything I drive, whether it's a navo-ho or tatho
It's got a ho in it
Nah ho I don't got no freakin Bronco
You're looking for a buck? Get a horse ? tano
I got a rusty Honda with some bonda and a box of condoms
Little blonde Bitch Fuck me? Fuck you too
Like a Mcbanaro-boo-abano
And I ain't from this planet so nano - nano nano
I'm intolerable, too vilatle, screw it
I don't gotta make the Honor roll to be On a roll
I don't know much, But what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off all these knock-off me's
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think, this is part 2 to recovery
Or Love the way you lie part 12
Or something Heartfelt you're about to make a Discovery
Like you failed Christopher Columbus's compass
Aint dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach that punctured a lung punk but I'm still functioning from it
Chump, this is nothing now watch, while i fuck one up it and toot my horn
Once i think of something to trumpet
And i don't need a fucking In-strument to sound off like a trunk of a elephant the triumphent
Return of the ether spittin' retard, reborn, but chances of you having another rebirth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Theresa, Give a fuck it's easter! So kiss my keester! Because that's the only thing i turn the other cheek for !



High on? What'd you say, trick? What am I on?
Two tubes of airplane glue and a can of Krylon
Eatin' a crayon, settin' fire to rayon
Flamin' the nylons of two white lesbians screamin', "Die, blondes"
Strike matches on white patches of dry lawns
And I run and jump right in front of the fire hydrants
Five blunts, and you expect me to die once
With nine lives, fuckin' chickens in front of my blind wives?
Suicidal, my friends tell me to try knives
You wanna mess with a mothafucka who skydives
Out of a plane to give the Statue of Liberty high fives?
Doin' drive-bys and miss you with five tries
It's Slim Shady and BET and Big Tigger, all y'all who see me flee



[Intro: Bizarre]
The rap game, hip hop 101
The hardest 9-to-5 you'll ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history book
You ready to rap, motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul?
Ha-ha-ha-ha, the rap game, motherfucker!

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm a disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You should've slayed me as a baby, behavin' shadier
Than Wes Craven and you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, drunk or sober, you’ll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop yo' ass
Your neck'll get snapped with bare hands; fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool, but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude, then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I'll blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back, nigga
You are not realer, in fact, you'll feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents sends me smack
And got a MAC-10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistaken me, black
Or you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'ma get snuffed, ‘cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I'll pipe down when the White House gets wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adiós, goodnight *gunshot* (Ah!)
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute, ‘cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America; fuck the government
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen-inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword; a sensei
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that ut-slay itch-bay
Uck-say my ick-day, 'scuse my ig-pay atin-lay
But uck-fay you ig-pay (50!)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
This rap game, this rap game (Yeah)
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you: no, it ain't happenin'
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I bet you'd rather me drink and drown in my own inequity
But fuck that! I'ma rap 'til y'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nut sack and spit all who pick at me
A pitt and rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I look at this, why speak on what I want when I write?
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
Okay, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no Source never made me not buy an album when they say it was wack

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I walk in that party and just start bustin'
Right after I hear the last verse of "Self Destruction"
This liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Day and Jerome (Nigga)
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
You're feelin' lucky? Squeeze, I catch you outside of
Chuck E. Cheese with your seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable: a partyin' addict
They said, "No fighting in the club" – so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas; call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns that saw you in half with

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Believe me, we run this rap shit, fo' sheezy
Make makin' millions look easy
Everywhere you turn, you see me
You hear me, believe me
Before you see my pistol in 3D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911, ‘cause you need the
Police to help you believe me

[Verse 5: Proof]
I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could say goodbye to Hollywood
'Cause Proof and Shyne, man, shit, nothing in common
The nastiest band with gats in each hand
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse; fuck your stature, dog!
Nothing to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact we can battle for plaques

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
This rap game

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Lorena Bobbitt
My crew had an argument, who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Well, I really didn't, but I did according to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin' 20 below, forced to join Bel Biv Devoe
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear
To make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks
Hahahaha, 50, sing the hook!

[Hook: 50 Cent]
This rap game, this rap game (Yeah)
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you: no, it ain't happenin'
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah, yeah



[Verse]
I'ma get snuffed, ‘cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I'll pipe down when the White House gets wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adiós, goodnight [gunshot] (AHH!)
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute, ‘cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America; fuck the government!
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch!
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade

And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade

But uck-fay you ig-pay (50!!!)



[Intro]
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But I'm only going to get this one chance."
"Something's wrong, I can feel it."
Six minutes. Six minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
"Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."
"You are just what the doc ordered."

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs, I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard! Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?



[Intro: Anthony Vincent]
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But it's been way too long since the last 20 Style song."
"So how about I give you 40 styles this time?"
"Some of you doubt I can do it, and if I prove you wrong, we're in big trouble."
"Why don't we take it from the first verse?"

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
Rap? I been in it ever since I was invented
That's cause a nigga live it
My records wield digits in history, nigga, you be the witness
I got the white boys mad at me
Cause Em signed another black boy, like he nigga-happy
Caucasians, Marshall knows talent
Obie Trice a riot, that's why he's hired
I hit your raves, balloons and E's
And bang all your European Pamela Lee's
Fucking ay, or how we say it round my way
"Fo sho", Trice gon' blow
Then I'm off to them shows, I'm off across the globe
'Til my accounts all swole for young Kobie
Pick things, act like your know me
Not a soul can hold me, I'm here

[Chorus: Obie Trice, Eminem, & Notorious B.I.G.]
That's why I ain't got no — rap name
The name's Obie Trice
They see me on the streets, they be like, "Yo, he nice!"
So I came to the game — real name, no gimmicks
Rap, I live it — That's why I ain't got no — Rap name
The name's Obie Trice
They see me on the streets, they be like, "Yo, he nice!"
So I came to the game — real name, no gimmicks
Rap, I live it — That's why I ain't got no — Rap name
The name's Obie Trice

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
It didn't take much – one hot single
Smiles and handshakes my man
The industry greeted me with open arms
With no type of flak cause O. Trice got that
Fugaze y'all rap, who gave y'all dat
New wave of mu-zack that you're all loving?
Got your broads on my balls huggin'
Even my next-of-kin's famous (Obie's your cousin?!)
Please believe it, I'm as "Down to Earth" as Chris Rock
Gettin' hit by trucks, starin' at twat
A big cannon in ya G-spot
Me not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot
Whether or not you believe my status
I'm prepared to be the baddest on the rap that's happenin'
Put the Mitten back on the map with Mathers and win this

[Chorus: Obie Trice, Eminem, & Notorious B.I.G.]
That's why I ain't got no — rap name
The name's Obie Trice
They see me on the streets, they be like, "Yo, he nice!"
So I came to the game — real name, no gimmicks
Rap, I live it — That's why I ain't got no — Rap name
The name's Obie Trice
They see me on the streets, they be like, "Yo, he nice!"
So I came to the game — real name, no gimmicks
Rap, I live it — That's why I ain't got no — Rap name
The name's Obie Trice

[Verse 3]
Well I'm drunk right now, but still I got a gun
Beef? [*cocked and two shots*] best-ta run
Cuz when I pop, people's flesh get numb
And whoa.. ya might not make it to ya young
The only one with okay's wanna blaze
Meet my little friends on racks in my den
Pull 'em out, that's when the action begins
And ya block, remind you of Mad Max the film
Deserted, that's word to vacant homes
2002 Trice up in ya headphones
(If it's ya system) Trice up in ya Bose
(If it's ya women) Then Trice up in ya hoes!
I suppose that I am kinda cocky, when it's dealin
With raps, chicks, and cats out to sock me
I handle it like Rocky, Jake Steed
Rakim, Eric B. – O's a G!

[Chorus: Obie Trice, Eminem, & Notorious B.I.G.]
That's why I ain't got no — rap name
The name's Obie Trice
They see me on the streets, they be like, "Yo, he nice!"
So I came to the game — real name, no gimmicks
Rap, I live it — That's why I ain't got no — Rap name
The name's Obie Trice
They see me on the streets, they be like, "Yo, he nice!"
So I came to the game — real name, no gimmicks
Rap, I live it — That's why I ain't got no — Rap name
The name's Obie Trice

[Outro: Obie Trice & Eminem]
Rap name — Rap name — Obie Trice..
You can get stomped by Obie



[Intro: Jahlil Beats]
Jahlil beats, holla at me!

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Philadelphia meet Detroit
Time to shut your mouth (where your money at?)
Now it's time to show these motherfuckers what's the fuss about (time to go!)
What you dealing with lyrically?
A couple lyricists who don't miss
Niggas ask if Black and Nickle get together for an album, what you gon' get?
You gon' get rap on steroids, rap on steroids
Niggas that's silencers on the nozzle
You won't feel the clap, you'll only hear the noise
Ya'll got these hoes pegged so wrong while you hotel checkin'
I gotta pay these hoes just to keep their clothes on like I'm Odell Beckham
I'm flyer than a hat on Elroy
I just took it back to the Jetsons
I with the static like I got a Crooked I
Near an open exit with a bad connection
Cause no matter where you go
You're fucked if this rubber grip roll back in your direction
What you lookin' at? That's for your protection
This that rap on steroids, nigga, that rap on steroids
I just spit more clairvoyant raps
Than it take to make you half paranoid
Clap a gun at any day or night
Stand over his body then pray to Christ
Like "you gave me life so I'm gon' throw you back one, dear lord"
I'mma throw back one like Fab on the 'Gram
Garage look like it's sponsored by Hasbro
Got the whole ave going HAM
Y'all don't know with what y'all are dealing
I'm on every block, my team bigger
Cause I rap anything I wanna got
The only thing I don't got is feelings
Nigga my mind so clear
Feels like every thought is visine drippin'
No I'm not a lean drinker, but over that Fetty Wap I lean niggas
This that....

[Hook: Assassin]
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Y'all ran into me on the wrong day
Fuck strong Jay, do gon' say
Just bear arms, you in harms way
You hear alarms, you in Bombay
No Baghdad, get the gas mask
Run break, do a mad-dash to that gun safe
You un-safe in the right place to get blast at
And that's anybody
I stay on that anabolic
I'm far from anatomically correct
Ho's call me that anaconda
Roll a sack of that Santa Barbara
Lead poisonin' in the damn water
Flint, Detroit, Ann Arbor
Philadelphia and Harlem
Roid rage y'all damn problem
Cemetery too damn crowded
I'ma go get the jack hammer
Go bury a body, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Everybody know everybody
I'm be damned if I didn't hear about it
Thought trifle the assault rifle
Got a twin brother like Irv Gotti, I'm [?]
Probably back on steroids
Kinda like crack on steroids
Lou Ferrigno super negro
Gon' and pack your steroids
Nigga my memoir's Renoirs
Everything I do is fine art
Putting rappers in that pine box
When that Black and Nickel Nine spark it's a problem
All stemming from them steroids probably
Got them coming back to Philly like it's heroin callin'
American horror, this that Smith and Wesson revolver
And if, life's a bitch we gon' Rohypnol her
They call it....

[Hook: Assassin]
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids

[Outro: Royce da 5'9", Black Thought, Eminem & Assassin]
Detroit we rappin' on
Steroids, boy
Philly we reppin' on
Steroids, yeah
All the rappers on steroids
Say we rapping on steroids
Nickle I'm rappin' on
Steroids, boy
Pesado rappin' on
Steroids, yeah
All the rap is on steroids
Said we rapping on steroids
I said I said every rap is on steroids
Nuff a them a chat and them a make bare noise
You don't wanna violate and make the K rise
Them a say the rap is on steroids
Nickle I'm rappin' on
Steroids, boy
Shady, I'm rappin' on
Steroids!



(Eminem speaking)
You know, people just don't...
People just don't see
How much work is really involved in this rap shit
I didn't know it, I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what it's like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see you smile
You always gotta put on that fake...
You know what I'm sayin'?
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right

(B-Real)
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

(B-Real)
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds, make money
Chill with the honeys
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny
How impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you got to go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers
And losin' some of your self
Through the years past, gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shit's deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Signed a deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will
'Til he crosses over, still
Fillin' your head with fantasies
Come with me
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Feelin' trapped in
What you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsin'
No fans, no fame
No respect, no change
No women
And everybody shits on your name

(Chorus)
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

(Noreaga speaking)
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these white boys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-N-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while you hot
And motherfuckin' get out the game
Just stick to the drug game
It's even worse because in the drug game
If somebody jerk you
You can shoot 'em and kill 'em and
If you, in this game if somebody jerk you
You gotta be humble

(Eminem Speaking)
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything's gotta be all good
When you see someone, slap hands with 'em
You know what I'm sayin'
Give 'em a pound or whatever it is, you know
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

(Chorus)

(B-Real)
My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that
My own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at The Palladium
Who just wanna cling on and swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil

(Chorus)



[Intro: Royce Da 5’9”]
Everything I say be raw (good God)
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
Everything I say be raw
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw (good God)
Everything I say be raw
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw (good God)
Everything I say be raw
Everything I say be raw

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
You can never be my nemesis
You against me is me being a fool
And you being an enemy with benefits
I don't even consider myself deep
When I'm rollin' with thirty niggas
'Cause I'm so used to being in a syndicate
Boots on with my strap on me
You don’t know how Yeezy the season finna get
Bad and Evil, catch a body, catch your body that’s a membership
Put you on my hit list then turn around and kill up all the snitches
Then turn around and go to church, repent
Then ask the reverend, “Can I get a witness?”
Ha, I got an I.O.U on my Bible’s view
Even God knows what I’m liable to do
When I’m high bro, I represent the same significance
In hip-hop as Pac and Biggie
Driving side car door, 'cept I'm alive though
Best believe I got no problem fucking your bitch, raw
And that mean I got no condom
Panamera Porsche, factory real white
That’s me in real life
And I’ll probably be ménaging more than the back of Meek Mill bike, I’m Hollywood

[Hook: Royce da 5’9”]
Good God, everything about me raw
From the lyrics to the gun play
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
And I mean it (ooh!, I'm raw)
Everything I do be raw
What I do, I do it one way
I'm hardbody, everything about me raw
And I mean it

[Interlude: Danny McBride]
"On top of the world
Every motherfucker wants to get a piece of your ass
Then if you take a little time off from being unstoppable
Just to regroup and relax
No one will give you the time of fucking day"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm the rawest, uh, rest of y'all just one of a
I’m becoming what I used to make fun of, a
Smug son of a bitch, fuck it though
Going for the fucking jugular
Leave them in a puddle of blood I’m a
Killer, but I'm a cut above the others
Bloody glove in a prison yard, Jodi Arias
I’m coming for you, fuck if the world doesn’t approve
Here I come as a custodian I'm dressed, to smuggle ya
Ass out wrapped up in a comforter come snuggle up with
Another fucking nut, we’ll make a tub of truffle butter
I’ma take this chubby, shove it up that nice round little bubble butt
Make it double-stuffed
Pull it out one hole, put it in the other one
Make a peanut butter cup, bust (yeah)
We can fuck on a golf cart
Tell me how you want it, soft, hard, or fucking rough
Like a dog bark, stop at a Walmart
Get a couple of 50 watt bulbs with a hot tub
Fill up them buns with a hot dog
To be frank these other motherfuckers ain’t even in the ball park
Then she pulled out the condiment drawer
She must heard this is where the condoms get stored
Sign above the door to the sauna says
“Welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah”
Told her I got something for her
Sharp and it’s pointed
And it’s head’s on swole, hold it like a samurai
She said, “Woah, look at that bulge, must have a huge ego”
I said, “Is it me you’re aiming that compliment toward?”
She said, “Yes my ninja, please get to stabbing this shit”
I commenced to dropping them drawers
Threw my black belt and gauntlets all onto the floor
Zipped down my fly, whipped out my confident sword

[Hook: Royce da 5’9”]
Good God, everything about me raw
From the lyrics to the gun play
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
And I mean it
Everything I do be raw
What I do, I do it one way
I'm hardbody, everything about me raw
And I mean it

[Outro]
"So that is why I’m better than everyone in the world
Kiss my ass and suck my dick, everyone"



[Intro]
Unh, yeah
Unh, yeah
Yeah (2x)

[Verse 1]
Wake up
Surrounding by crumbled pages
Scrolling down Tumblr pages
For something human, it's called inspiration
I call it "purpose", you call it "work," but I call it worthless
Some niggas work like their calling is to call on the nurses
Leave your verse inside a funeral home, I never left
You second guess what I would do for the throne
I was sixteen, I get cheese to craft me a home
I packed up a loan, one bedroom and my microphone
As I hoped to make a living off the beats
My grandma fell asleep and even she lost here pulse
My goal became never say, there can't be a better place
'Til you get there, make this a heaven state
Let us pray, wake up, meditate, break up
Medicate, bake up, levitate
All I need is head and space
My city reminds me I'm not anything godly
Just a mix of complexity like I'm Biggie and Gandhi
And I'll be tight as the pants on Will.I.Am
I'm everything I feel I am
If I'm not, until I am
Or wait to the day I feel I am
Get ready for the real I am



(Dial tone)

[Eminem & Fat Beats Receptionist]
(Fat Beats)
Um, I was wondering if you have, um, wha-what's his name?
Sli-Eminem, or Slim Shady
Cause a friend of mine's got the album (already?)
Yeah! (He bought it?)--The whole album
I don't know if he bought it, I don't know if he got it off the internet
I don't know, I don't know what the deal is (uh huh)
I don't know, but he's got it, like--(Yeah, well we don't-we're not selling it)
Aww, well cause the third, have you heard the third track? (No I haven't heard it)
Th-the, okay, aw, I was wondering who produced it, the third track
I don't know, cause the snare, the snare is like "csh, csh, csh"
(Well I really don't know, I don't know the song)
Aw okay, alright
Well if it-cause everybody's telling me they have it
I don't, I don't know, is it--(Yeah I don't, I don't know where it's at either)
Oh okay, is Ka--(I have to take another call sir)
Okay I didn't mean to hold you up I'm sorry (alright)
Fuck you!



[Eminem & Fat Beats Receptionist]
I was like -oh, hello? (Yeah)
Um, I-I just have one more question
I don't know if you were the guy we were talking to, um
I just called a few minutes ago, about Eminem (okay)
Um, probably what I was wondering, um
Is if, I-I-I don't know, I've seen Eminem
(What's the question, sir?)
He did a show at Tramps and his hair was like, blond
And I was wondering, actually, that's not even a question
But I was wondering, um, is-is-is
Is Dr. Dre, um, is he white?
(muffled sounds]
(Hello?)
H-Hello, hi (yes)
Um, I had a que-
The oh-this ain't the--, oh this a girl
(This is a girl, yeah) Oh, I-I'm sorry
I had a couple of questions about, um, about this guy Eminem
I-I know him, I-I'd, I know him, I've-I've like, I've like studied him
I-I've-I know all his freestyles by heart
(Okay, can you please lower your voice?)
I'm sorry, I'm just really excited because something-
My friend came over here, the album (Uhuh)
And, I don't know how he got the album, he sa-
He said he got it off the internet or something
But I was figuring like, maybe Fat Beats like, had a bootleg
Or something that I could just get
I wouldn't, like, turn you guys in or nothing like that, just--
(We don't have Eminem's album, Eminem's album coming out in February)
They don't have it Brian, you fucking dick!
Okay, is-is-is-i-i-i, it's, um
Is Dr. Dre white?
(Dr. Dre is not white, that I know of
The Dr. Dre I know ain't white, I don't know)
Oh! (He's black as I know him)
Oh, okay, okay, oh!
Dr. Dre, the Dr. Dre from The Chronic, you asshole!
You guys are so-- you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
These guys are embarassing me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry (alright)
Dr. Dre is not white, Dr. Dre is not white, you fucking dicks
Hello? (yeah)
Ok, thank you very much (You're welcome)
Ok, goodbye

[Chorus: RBX]
Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high-powered
Remember me? I drop bombs, like Hiroshima

[Verse 1: RBX]
For this one, they scream "X, you retarded?!"
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term “universal” without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air!
Remember me? Slam! Slam!
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup!
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like “No! No! No!”
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit, it's all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, gon' start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires, niggas wantin' me dead
Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck!
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too!
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty!
Remember me? I'm Shady!

[Verse 3: Eminem (& Dr. Dre)]
When I go out, I'ma go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say “fuckin'” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at!
(What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)

[Outro: Eminem]
Don't you remember me?
Remember me? Remember me?
Remember me? (Slim Shady!)



Lyrics from snippets

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Private eye, you know nothing 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now I'm deep...

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember (What?), trying to shop a deal
Some type [?]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
.. get my Fendi drip, man, you know just what I mean



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
Callin' all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow "whee"
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Interlude: Eminem]
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Bridge: Eminem & Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]
Said "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slide hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I’m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)



Yeah
Damn girl
Do I drive you crazy?
You make me crazy, too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
’Cause you remind me of myself



[Couplet 1]
Énervé depuis l'époque des billes, j'avais déjà rien dans l'sac à dos
J'suis pas l'ado qui part en vrille, mais maman j't'ai pas fait d'cadeau
La rue j'l'aime autant que j'la déteste et c'est comme ça
Quand j'étais p'tit j'ai vu des grands s'tirer dessus pour une sse-lia
Maintenant ça c'est banal, tous les jours j'sors, j'entends des trucs de fou
Quand y'a embrouille y'a le pe-pom sous un drap ou dans un sac de foot
Depuis quand j'rentre chez moi la nuit, j'en ai des trucs à dire
J'suis le blanc d'ta cité qui traîne dans des coins qui t'empêcherait d'dormir
Avant pour être franc, on pensait pas aux euros
On aurait pu passer des heures à aider juste pour faire des heureux
J'étais à l'école en face d'la cité, j'voyais passer le sse-cro
J'analyse les gens et toi j'sais pas pourquoi tu fais l'ssiste-gro
Ouais mon pote, c'est la vie, et c'est comme ça
On a tous des blessures qui n'se refermeront peut-être pas
On savait pas c'était quoi les vices mais maintenant on a grandi
J'ai compris que l'argent fait pas l'bonheur, rends les gens moisis
Mon chemin j'l'ai pas choisi, j'ai pas choisi d'voir maman pleurer
La rue, le rap j'kiffais alors j'me suis déscolarisé
Dans la rue quand t'es blanc, faut t'faire ta place encore plus qu'un autre
R-E-M-Y, si j'réussis j'lèverai mon verre à la vôtre
Pas d'sentiments dans nos halls, les yeux couleur violet
On tenait les murs pendant que d'vant ta meuf, bah toi tu miaulais
Avoir des couilles de nos jours vaut pas le prix d'une Rolex
Voilà pourquoi on t'vole ta montre et on la vends à un collègue

[Refrain]
J'ai galéré toute ma vie, j'veux pas finir en bas, et ça d'puis mes premiers pas
J'ai su ce que je voulais
Mais dis-moi tu veux faire quoi, quand la vie te tabasse
Te laisse sans ta monnaie
On a galéré, la rue nous a pas laissé l'choix, laissé l'choix d'rester en bas
On veut se sauver
Mais dis-moi tu veux faire quoi, quand la vie te tabasse
Te laisse sans ta monnaie

[Couplet 2]
Maman, pour nous sortir de là, j'en ferais des trucs de fou
Ma soeur, j'lui ferais cracher son sang si j'vois il tord son cou
Sale schmitt quand tu m'contrôles tutoies-moi pas, on s'connait pas
Quand j'étais p'tit tes collègues les bacqueux, ils rigolaient sur moi
Mes potes mangent des coups de flashball parce que t'aimes pas leur couleur
Si y'avait pas l'rap, moi dans l'mal j'aurais craché ma douleur
Maintenant j'vois la vie en couleur, j'ai tendance à moins douter
Les grosses putes me porteront l'oeil car pour eux y'a pas d'gouter
Ma poésie vient d'en bas, elle m'tirera peut-être vers le haut
J'écris la nuit et j'me rappelle comment la rue c'est pas beau
J'ai passé ma vie sur l'pavé, sur l'banc y'a que des macabés
Et toi tu chourres, tu t'fais courser par des équipes de cinglés
On veut tous des thunes à mort car nos vies ont un goût amer
Si j'réussis pas, bah Maman n'ira pas vivre en bord de mer
Merde, c'est la merde. Que des équipes en Twingo
Armés devant ta chicha pour racoler 2-3 pines-co
Ouais moi j'te raconte ma vie, j'te raconte pas celle d'un autre
J'aimerais sortir vivre normalement, mais j'peux pas payer la note
Ouais poto y'a pas d'argent, en retard est le loyer
Mes sentiments ont pris l'eau, depuis qu'mon cœur est noyé
Te lamente pas sur ton sort mon poto c'est Dieu qui donne
C'est lui qui reprends donc reprends-toi avant que ton heure sonne
Beaucoup ont fait du shtar car dans la rue depuis mineur
Tu vois maman pleurer quand tu ressors de tes 48 heures

[Refrain]
J'ai galéré toute ma vie, j'veux pas finir en bas, et ça d'puis mes premiers pas
J'ai su ce que je voulais
Mais dis-moi tu veux faire quoi, quand la vie te tabasse
Te laisse sans ta monnaie
On a galéré, la rue nous a pas laissé l'choix, laissé l'choix d'rester en bas
On veut se sauver
Mais dis-moi tu veux faire quoi, quand la vie te tabasse
Te laisse sans ta monnaie

[Outro]
C'est Rémy



[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do, through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
"No, he's not around." Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it—not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘Cause, here we go; he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Hook: Eminem (& JAY-Z)]
—renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
‘Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything! (Anything)
Renegade! (Never been afraid to say)
(What's on my mind at any given time of day)
(‘Cause I'm a) renegade!
(Never been afraid to holler about anything)
Anything? (Anything) Anything!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "Dixie"
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'—

[Hook: Eminem (& JAY-Z)]
—renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
‘Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything

[Intro]
Yo, we on?
Aight look, we all need something to believe in right?
Well shit, believe in me

[Verse 1]
Now I'm 'bout to show you suspense
Incline is intense
I'm about to spit rhymes, flip lines in sentence
I'm hitting all your senses, I'm about to move you
Fuck keeping up cuz I promise not to lose you
I'm 23 years old and I'm going through a lot of shit
Still trying to figure out the real from the counterfeit
Babymomma? Hell I'm tryna wrap my mind around the bitch
Cuz a condom wasn't round the dick when it was time to hit
I can't scream can't yell, feeling pissed and well
I'm dealing with, psycho ass, spiteful ass, Danielle
Ask me how it feels to have a baby by a bitch with fuckin' issues
Just to misuse, it against you, just to diss you
But I don't need no tissues
Fuck crying, I wanted out, like I'm in a haunted house
Now the truth is coming out (Wooow)
What? Lying? I don't fuck with that
So someone tell her take the knife out my fuckin' back, and cut it out
What about, my Marley?
Nobodies above you, I wanna kiss you and hug you
Miss you, I love you my darling, I hardly
Can ever see you, not even alone
We gotta sit in the car, can't even be in your home
So every second, in that moment, is a blessing so I own it
And just hold it and caress it, but it's stressing and it's showing
Especially, whenever I leave and I'm gone
I see your pic it gets to me, and kiss the screen on my phone
That's my daughter, my dedication, and motivation to go harder
I got patience, but better make it to stardom
I hate to be part of, rock bottom, I got problems
And stockpile em, it's making smarter, but not solve em
My dumbass just got the smarts to put it up in my lyrics
I want you to hear it, for me now (How?)
So every time I speak now, I want you to feel it
From deep down to you guts right up to your spirit
I want something anyway, it's respect
These bloodsuckers been afraid, so suspect
I'm a motherfuckin' renegade, hear it in the voice in my rhymes
The choice in my lines, I'm sick with these niggas and I ain't finna play
Not on any day, I'm not afraid, to say anything, word to Em and Jay
In a way, I'm quick with these triggers (Man, scratch it out)
Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga, the shit I deliver
Will make you shiver and quiver, cuz nigga,, I'm a renegade



[Intro]

Take the shades off, they gotta see me for this one
Throw the hoodie on, they gotta feel me for this one
Don...
Corner Stories coming soon, you dig?

[Verse]

I'm sitting court-side with niggas that bought pies
Talking boss vibes, they hustled and thought wise
Had a lot of friends, now it's like a short nine
'Cause either they all died, in jail or crossed sides
Look, it's non-fiction whenever the Don spittin'
It's palms itchin', never knew his father, heart missin'
In the middle of the night, and he caught his mom sniffin'
Hard livin', bet you never see them scars healin'
We just praying on a good hand while the cards dealin'
Really feelin' like we ain't start winnin' till we start sinnin'
Half of the time, it's murder on the back of my mind
Packagin' dimes, young nigga just adaptin' to crime
Never got a hand out, I ain't ask for a dime
These are stories out my life, they just happen to rhyme
And I'm destined for greatness, I expect them to hate this
Trust me, your grind is never respected till you make it
Liquor gettin' spilled for the niggas that was killed
You can't see my eyes 'cause my hoodie on tilt
We ain't getting no sleep til the mission complete
We just tryna see a million a week
All praises to the Lord Saviour
I made a come up off them old razors
Chasin' short paper on a corner til the force take us
Bunch of law breakers, small hood, we was all neighbors
And all the ball players turn to .44 sprayers
Different kind of thrill when you pay your momma bills
Fans, got a record label, nigga signing deals
Them OGs had candy canes and candy rain
Movin' pictures, it's new edition, can you stand the rain?
This ain't a game, this a family thing, I manage pain
Wonder when the damage came, certain shit I can't explain
Friends killin' friends and they lit up a ten
Over bitches and ends, tell me when will it end
And I live through it, niggas tellin', I seen the real do it
Momma told me "don't stand on that corner", and I still do it
Since boot rooms, the kid been locked in like a group home
Dropped out of class, made a killin' on the school zone

[Outro]

Yeah...
We ain't playin' no games, they know what the fuck it is



It's Young Money
Euro, look


[Verse]
I hear the shots bein fired
My enemies wired
Keep pushin' me to execute the same folks I inspired, like why?
Tire yourself out to be hopeless and tied
Anyone over me is simply roastin over the fire
I'm over desired flow, Fijis spit feces, it's my time
Don't gotta watch to see me, believe me, can't take it easy
'Til my house in Providence looks like the one in Washington, DC
No need to campaign, expect change
Imma do my damn thing, think otherwise you damn wrong
Trynna balls out when motherfuckers tell you to keep your pants on
I hear the softest rappers throwing temper tantrums
And these hardcore rappers singing camp songs
Something ain't right, ain't nothing alike, we nothing alike
I keep my distance, they squinting to see something in sight
Take a step closer for some to say
"I hope you know that no weapon will ever be stronger than what I spit on the mic"
I understand, I might be out of my line
Getting on a beat that's out of my time, I'm out of my mind
But fuck it, I'm over average, I no longer feel a challenge
When people would rather listen to who's trending than who has talent
Blame the environment, it's never silent
Couldn't dream, every attempt to sleep disturbed by sirens
Such a violent harmony plays when you strum my vocal cords on a violin
I am in no position of quitting on living the life I was given
Driven and became distant from those who witnessed
I kept working, they kept wishing, that's the difference
Threatened by my spitting so they spit on my image
I'm a spitting image of linen, wait a minute
Didn't you say I couldn't and wouldn't do?
But I did it, couldn't fit in so I told 'em good riddance
Y'all forgotten, not forgiven
I wouldn't have hurt your feelings if y'all wasn't that similar to women
I go nowhere unless it's too far
I'm not good enough until I'm better than you are, whoever you are
That's if you are the real ya
It's easy to die if life is hard enough to kill ya
First time for everything, I'm everything's first time
First and last word in every verse mine
But first off, know my first words were said in Spanish
So how I manage to be this good with words and English is my second language?

[Hook]
I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind at any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to holler about anything
Anything, anything, anything



[Intro] I Shouldn't be stepping on this beat right now 2 legends on one track i shouldn't be doing it but i spit a couple bars real quick


See i'm a renegade you niggas is sweet lemonade minute made killers kidnapped yo babies if they well paid self made invade yo brain with my lyrics no pen and pad can you hear it? a renegade to spirt flow is cold can't ignore it jakes hot then we floor it its important  that you understand never ever fear another man never get finessed out yo bands be you chase yo dream if they don't understand then fuck them  never shake the hand of a fake cause now days niggas snitching talking to the jakes never compromise for no man for no sake and if i die trying get rich fuck it thats my fate if you hate why that? all i do is  try my best chase these checks never follow the rest flow sicker then incest sex and that semi automatic shoot straight threw yo vest



[Verse 1: Royce]
It's several different levels to picking up shovels
And dumping you in ditches under sea level
Front and you can witness
Let me refreshen you niggas, tell you my position in this
(Ch-chk!) Beef! Leave you under Venice, opposition finished
Here it is, we invaded, created a pyramid
Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his
So (ah-ha, ah-ha) breathe, I'd rather reach for your neck
And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me with less
I got a skunk in my trunk, I'm lying, I got a pump in my trunk
You dying, how many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open that can of worms
I hope you ready for the dirt that's with it
Slap a ho, snatch a mic
Being brought to y'all in black and in white
(It's the new!) Joe Jackson and Ike
We renegades

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause see, they call me a menace
And if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference
They're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause, here we go: He's Royce, he's the King of Detroit
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Hook: Eminem]
—renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything (Anything)

[Verse 3: Royce]
I determine what time it's on, I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limon and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks, I'm tired of niggas that's like (I'm 'bout to blow)
Unless you a bitch, we don't care if you 'bout do that
Move back, youngster, the Glock gon' speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
Or flash the clip, or give you the picture, develop the
Click clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip-hop Quotable tug of war
Who did you niggas' beats, you bitches, who made it work?
That shit was *pfft* — I got harder two-way alerts
Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, he probably go get you the nina
You talk about his momma, he won't even give you the finger
(He's crazy) Deranged, not media eaters, we renegades

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan, a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin'—

[Hook]
—renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything
'Cause I'm a renegade!

At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
So can you rescue me
Because my ship is sinking
And I'm drowning at sea
So can you rescue me, from me
Can you rescue me?

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I was losing my mind like I was trying to lose it
Using my time for using, abusing my grind
This is my own honest view of who I am behind this, music
Ryan the whole bottle of patron Connaisseur
At a point in time I thought I blew it, doing crime
I would've washed a pill down with a shot of my own spinal fluid
And my momma knew it, she saw especially right through it
That I wasn't protected cause peer pressure just be like (do it)
But I couldn't fight through it, the beef started
The streets caught up, at least we didn't get involved in deceased orders
It's Slaughterhouse, cause Shady, me, Porter
Sat it down and made peace over Porterhouse and Piesporter

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Some stupid bitch done turned my girl against me
Should've tattooed the earth on my arm feel like the world against me
Soon as I pa-raded, here come the rain falling the name calling
From the cous' I never met with his hand out like I'm straight balling
Feel like I knocked the 8 ball in
Every time I shoot a move I literally can't call it
Am I afraid of success? Let me think on it
I just got nervous, let me drink on it
Think I just answered yes but not on purpose
I pass the church and do the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
But I'm only near it, man I need the pastor's service
I'm drowning cause I'm so tired of treading
So Lord when you get a second please

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
So can you rescue me
Because my ship is sinking
And I'm drowning at sea
So can you rescue me, from me
Can you rescue me?

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
I wake up and my shirt is leaking, covered in sweat
I'm dreaming of being murdered when I'm sleeping
Picture a person beefing, with himself
And it's even, worse when I'm drinking
It hurts when I'm thinking, me versus my personal demons
I'm reaching for my nine
If I point it at myself will it help to quiet the demons screaming in my mind?
And if I go, to the other side
Just tell my mother it was her prayers that kept her young'un thugging son alive
Plus my daughters, them my butterflies, tell my son that I love him
Tell my nieces and nephews their uncle tried
To take this music to the fucking peak
But I'm still a drug dealer as we fucking speak, that's fucking weak

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Behind the tours and rap fans, hospitals and cat scans
Shoulder, when they call him bipolar, happiest mad man
Don't know my story, my struggle, the demons that I combat
Or how I'm starin' at them waiting for eye contact, beyond that
I got a soul mate that's naive, so the thought of me is prison to her
Baby momma that's crazy and a ten year old who listen's to her
My fam and friends think I'm the bank
And the way they keep coming back you think I'd got thanked
To you it's a dream, to me it's labor, these aren't monsters, these my neighbors
And we watch each others back, I guess its favor for a favor
Sometimes they even save me, when my wrist is to that razor so

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
So can you rescue me
Because my ship is sinking
And I'm drowning at sea
So can you rescue me, from me
Can you rescue me?



[Eminem]
I wasn't born mean I was pushed to trechary
I walked the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I like a veggie brain, turn to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the mc
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg, made outta wood? I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dyke on the mic, I'm kinda like...
Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes

[Mr.Porter]
Well, I must must say well uh
I'm just not gay well I
I'm must must say um well
See I'm the first to class and the last to leave
I mean I'm the first one to leave out of class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart til' I die
Even after I'm all gone and my ashes fry
Went from ashy guy, class clown this high
To a grown ass man
Runyons ave's the click, D12's the gang
We been spitting; this shit since we was little baby's
Gaga googoo nana, nanny booboo? never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 45 shot'll leave a motherfuckers face lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock eyed-ed
When I bust it off in the crow, you start diving
Greg Louganis in over the bar, I ain't lyin'
Hot I ain't equal, it's not defying a soldier
Runyons Ave soldier equals death when it's over
There's nothing colder than niggas than understranded struggle
Fly the street muscle, We been had the hussle
We been had the hussle, We been had the hussle
Fly the street muscle, We been had the hussle

[Eminem]
Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash, bumping Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn near﻿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash, hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge, into on coming traffic
Caused a massive 42 car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard, you can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdraw
Dick's so big it's like estlastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man, with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic Sports

[Mr. Porter]



[Hook: Eminem]
I don't wanna go to school, I don't need no education!
(We don't need no education)
I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna save the nation! (daddy no!)
I just wanna live my life, every day a celebration!
(We don't need no thought control)
One day I'mma leave this world, I'm waiting for the revelation!

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
I wanna kill myself! I'm still debating
In front of a baptist church masturbating, praying to Satan
Think I'm crazy cause I smoke crack
Live on B with the mac in a two family flat (fuck it)
Tired of getting hit in the face with a broom
My moms on her period, my dad's in my room (Daddy no!)
I got ten rocks and I need to get out
I sold them in five minutes, at my own damn house (Moms smoke crack)
My poor grandmother, God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS (aww) she just waiting to die of a cold (hahaha)
There's three things that keep me from being a Nazi:
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
No matter how bad the beating, I went to school cheating
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting
Skipping school I had to have nuts just to do it
Got bored and became truant
When I had the gall to go I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel
Getting threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel
Like me, outcast, last to class
First to leave, when the teacher called on me
Best believe I had something up my sleeve

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I've been praised and labeled as crazed
My mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage
An angry teenager, nothing can change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boosting, so influenced by music I used it
As an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid
No one can tell me nothing hip-hop overwhelmed me
To the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
It was like isolating myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school had failed me
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me
I was nothing, and I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at, a fucking drop-out that quit
Stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it
That's why

[Hook: Eminem]
I don't wanna go to school, I don't need no education!
(We don't need no education)
I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna save the nation! (daddy no!)
I just wanna live my life, everyday a celebration!
(I don't need no self control)
One day I'mma leave this world, I'm waiting for the revelation!

[Verse 4: Swifty McVay]
I was raised with a rifle and mask
Steadily beating my psychiatrist ass just for asking about my past
(bitch) I was never on that punk shit; fucking around
Can get your beloved abducted, smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father, it must of been poison in that nigga's nut
Far as probation, fuck peeing in cups
I violate at any time, let them see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbating inside of cells
Young as hell, having conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't lenient, a disobedient
Lynched and slapped teachers, bitch I'm not reading it
You don't know what dogs go through, a little nigga
Sipping liquor with my old dude, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'm quick to curse you, I told my mother that I'mma hurt you
If you ever again mention that curfew

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
Look, my family ignores me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell them I'll be right back
(Yeah whatever) This nice beautiful house ma, it don't mean shit
Cause you know daddy's a drunk and he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man
I couldn't stand up to him, I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this, I wish on Christmas
That I can get a loaded four-fifth and put a fucking end to this
(Fuck it) I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothing to smile about, I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine, now I'm wilding out

[Verse 6: Proof]
When school's over, pu-pil are people to shoot through
Kids going cuckoo, with a two-two
Since my friend is this new dude, in this high school
Losing his noodle learn that people don't like you
The football jocks is, spitting on him
Popular kids in school is now picking on him
Burn out youngster niggas now hitting on him
And his teacher in his english class keep flipping on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
For drinking forty ounces, 'cause he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?
Already got expelled for wearing a trench coat
All I ever seen is... (Violence, violence...)
Told me to keep silent, stop battin' my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blew out my brains in front of the wall (Fuck you!)

[Hook: Eminem]
I don't wanna go to school, I don't need no education!
(We don't need no education)
I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna save the nation! (daddy no!)
I just wanna live my life, everyday a celebration!
(I don't need no self control)
One day I'mma leave this world, I'm waiting for the revelation!

[Outro / Skit: Eminem]
If you don't eat your meat, how can you have any pudding?
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
You can't have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!



[Intro: P!nk]
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Like Leo in The Revenant
Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet, isn't it?
Really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fuckin' comin' true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house
Take your shoes, take your heart
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
And now here comes that singin' part

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin', let me count the ways
How I'll get you or how I'll make you pay
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' and now you'll feel the same
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan, mhm
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (now, now)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime, but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word, we make it sting for him
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye, you piece of sh—
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Here's that singin' part again
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin' (I'm daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (how I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (you pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (feel the same)
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (revenge is sweet)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal
But just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady friends—whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated and I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up, 'cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count, get it? (I hate you)
And then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me, then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
(Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, SLUT!)
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me, while I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember, you cheated on me first (bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war
Fellas, ladies

[Hook: Eminem & P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (oh-ohh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh-ohh)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

[Outro: Eminem & P!nk]
Fuck yeah!
Fuck no!

[Verse: Alice and the Glass Lake]
I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival



(dialing tone)

[Dialogue: Eminem & (Masseur)]
(Hello?)
Hi, can I speak to Rex please?
(Speaking)
How ya doin', um, my name's Ken
Um, I'm lookin' for a buddy
(What do you need?)
Just- cold work my wife is sitting right here
Um, just a buddy, like, you know, a friend
Someone to pal around with
I'm thirty-two, I'm, I'm single
Can it be arranged?
(When?)
Um, whenever
If you have time tonight, um, that'd be great
I mean, I'm just- I'm really waiting
(I don't understand what you're looking for)
Cock massage, whatever
I'm just really ready
I've been waiting too long
(I don't under- what do you mean)
I mean, I'm just ready
You know, like
(Well, I mean its, what I do is a massage)
Alright, do you use lubricants?
(Right)
Cause- okay
Aww, good, thank god, cause-
I was wondering cause I never, I never did this before
But man... Rex
(But you know I'm not working tonight, so you'll have to call me another time)
Really? Um, okay, what about tomorrow
(Yeah give me a call tomorrow)
Okay, if- what time should I call
(Well, whenever you're- you know, you know for sure your schedule)
Ok- are we gonna fuck or what cause I'm ready
(No)
Please?
[Hangs up]
(Laughs)



[Intro: Sample + Eminem]
("What's your name?") Marshall
("Who's your daddy?") I don't have one

[Verse 1]
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, "In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan."
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, "Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard."
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch

[Chorus]
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promised land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge: Sample + Eminem]
("Now, what's your name?") Marshall
("Who's your daddy?") I don’t know him, but I wonder—
("Is he rich like me?") Ha
("Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")

[Verse 2]
No, if he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, Dad, I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rappin', blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor
I must plead guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
("Hip-hop is the Devil's music")
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—

[Chorus]
It's the time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge: Sample + Eminem]
("What's your name?") Shady
("Who's your daddy?") I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder
("Is he rich like me?") Doubt it, ha
("Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")

[Verse 3]
So, yeah, Dad—let's walk
Let's have us a father-and-son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I a-ppealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads!
The sign of my hustle says:
"Don't knock, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute!"
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion until I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a "Criminal!"
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals!
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald!
When will the madness end?
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
The only message that I have to send
Is: "Dad, I'm back at it again!"

[Outro]
Yeah… (Who's your daddy?)



I put my orange
4 Inch
Door hinge in storage
And ate porridge
With George



[Obie Trice]
Yeah, Trice
The Statik Selektah

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
O back around the corner, got the crack
Put in your orders, we 'bout to run up out the storages
It's notorious, the way I got big spitting stories
BME's X-Clan, vanglorious
We're not your favorite, fuck it, you know the system
And you buck it, have you revisiting how you used to love it
My niggas spew through the music, acoustics
School kid used to pursue excuses
Truth is, I was truant in school
So its influence is foolish, that was my views
I’m back at it, the rap addict, by any means
We gonna get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
Say he ain't a star, niggas might be right
I'm so regular, nigga gotta shit tonight
Take it back Selektah, let 'em know it's Trice
Put your seatbelts on, we gon' ride tonight

[Verse 2: Eminem]
And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise! Hi, it's Ike
'Bout to get my Ike on, I come with a life supply of wife beaters
And my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic
Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream
With the pliers, like "Ahh!" only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home, pick up two Big Bufords
Scrupulous, girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested
To impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman
And get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement
If you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a ho 'cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me in senseless mind babble
"What me? Apologize?" That's just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled!

[Hook: Eminem]
Just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard 'cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates it's your first clue, Sherlock, prick!
Just call me Richard

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
That's my motives, jumpin' off in Rovers
All white, like I was right up in the Dakotas
Or Minnesota, did I mention soda?
When it's mixed with the yola, watch my cup runneth over
Cut from a soldier, them ho niggas disposable toaster
Putting holes in a nigga getting close enough
BME 'til the credits roll
'til my condition is beyond what the medics know
They wanna edit O, like a prosthetic third
Leg let it go, this is Shady 1.0, Em let 'em know
I still profit through the process
The prize in my jeans my balls'll never digress
I'm a dick that I brag about
I put it in faster than I drag it out
World, I be your special friend see
'Cause these suckas suffer from pseudo-penis envy... So!

[Hook: Eminem]
Just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard 'cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates it's your first clue, Sherlock, prick!
Just call me Richard



[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!

[Eminem]
Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow, just so that
I don't explode and, have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have something to do with that
They all trying get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common that we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence it is, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and uhh
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was, hollering, "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when, they were still making, Maxell casettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stop



[Intro]
Aw, man, yeah
You ever be in the club, man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You feel like you wanna hit somethin'
Your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splittin' your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is, I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's startin' to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl
Soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene
But it's too late, it's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could've made you anticipate such an ass-whipping, okay
'Til the anger dissipates
You'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on

[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 2]
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace 'cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
'Cause if you doubt me, you will
Yeah, got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl, howdy, how do you feel, ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh, hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal, ridaz?
Now here they all come
And they got your back in, like, two seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'Cause they want in on the act, there's a Cognac bottle
We snuck it in 'cause the beer
That they was serving here was only tap
I'm bitin', I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like, "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose, pussy
The louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off, faggot, so now how do you 'spose we settle it?
Hit me in the nose and we'll see how it goes

[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 3]
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tusslin', the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushin' through us just like a geyser gushin'
Too much Budweiser in my blood
I'm stranglin' your windpipe for nothing
My signature's ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As havin' me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact, I'll have the crowd smackin' you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on

[Chorus]
So, what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Outro]
Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I almost feel... invincible and shit
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable
Damn



[Verse 1]
I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin', pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryin' to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms, so fuck all of you!
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
‘Cause I think I started hallucinating, ‘cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I could do was follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail-polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight, I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice, so I'm not as deluded
‘Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi, but that hoochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
Butt juicier, ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth-waterin' too
So I walked over to her, like, “I’m Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya"
Oh, I'm a misogynist too, but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth, uh!
Chronic abuser, and I don't mean a user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a Ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood, so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, I'm fuckin' stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
That were placed next to Veronica's boobs
And the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for him

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 2]
Thought I’d give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsing under that
Well, that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
‘Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah
But that passion and hunger's back
What a fantastic juggling act!
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped a duffel bag to my back
And stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it
And an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back
Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal
And just as I'm to come crashin'
I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
Rub my magic mushroom tat
For luck, then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up, then gasp, lungs collapsed
And that's more likely than finding someone that's…

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 3]
Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"You're top ten, ain't cha?"
Stop it, you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless
Whatever your job is, I give a fuck what's your occupation
You're thinkin' just ‘cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
If you dug him up; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles, bacon
A fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it
Flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way, then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
They all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Dr. Dre, so then what is it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation?!
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazin'
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption, here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
'Til I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come
Before I finally stumble upon some lady that’s…

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me



[Intro]
Y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Webby!
See I'm trying to get drunk as fuck tonight man

[Verse 1]
You see I’m back here to rip another throwback jam
They’re like damn, I don’t know how Webby go that HAM
Lift your shirt up, baby girl, show that tan
Skin covered in cartoons, but I’m a grown ass man
I don’t care about your name, when I’m steppin’ to you
All I’m thinkin’ about is that we got some effin' to do
Sippin’ on a potion like Dr. Jekyll would do
Cause I got loose screws in my head and it’s true
I need my medication renewed I’m doing this shit
Start howlin’ at the moon at a lunar eclipse
Bark, growl, scratch every human I bit
And choke the fuck out of a beat until I’m losing my grip
Maneuvering quick looking for a huge set of tits
And beat it up sorry babe but you'll be bruisin’ a bit
Whip it out so you all could get a view of my dick
Because I never gave a fuck and now I’m proving it bitch

[Chorus]
Hey, and this is my favorite song
Sing along when the DJ throws it on
I got a bag full of weed and a big-ass bong
And we gon' drink till we can’t tell right from wrong

[Verse 2]
Holy Moly, Webby’s here
Hit a house party, drink every beer
I’m just tryna find a girl real sexy here
And if you’re not DTF hit the exit dear, ha
I just say what I say, I’m drunk as hell, fuck it
I’ll even take a grenade
Just give me a fat bitch and a bottle a day
As long as I’m drunk, you’re never gonna hear me complain
Hey, hey, I’m the last Beastie Boy
With my dick in a girl’s mouth like a squeaky toy
In a pitbull’s grill, rip shit still
Hole in my brain from all of the E pills
I’m a motherfucking crazy dude
Eatin’ baby food, a turkey dinner with some gravy too
First place in a race, I’ma cross that line
So lock me up doc, cause I’ve lost my mind

[Chorus]
Hey, and this is my favorite song
Sing along when the DJ throws it on
I got a bag full of weed and a big-ass bong
And we gon' drink till we can’t tell right from wrong

[Verse 3]
See Webby comes back with the horse play
A liability, at least that’s what the courts say
In a bedroom, get too rough
Take a bite out of a bitch looking for True Blood
Uh, I do it like no other
Condom in my pockets, I'll do it with no rubber
Got the bed shake and you think that you heard thunder
And got ‘em running back to me quicker than Road Runner
And I get ‘em in the sack tonight
Beat it up, I don’t care if they be black or white
Or tan, a blue, a green, I still smash it right
Make it hot, I don’t even need a match to strike
Ha, nobody could stop the beast
With a tongue this slick when I rock the beat
Sweepin’ all your girlfriends off they feet
And I don’t even give a fuck if they got some teeth, ha

[Chorus]
Hey, and this is my favorite song
Sing along when the DJ throws it on
I got a bag full of weed and a big-ass bong
And we gon' drink till we can’t tell right from wrong

[Outro]
Damn, I'm drunk man, fuck!
Couple forties deep and shit
Webby's Lab, as always you know
Cooking up that crack rock
Ha, shouts to Obie
Aight man, I'm fuckin' outta here dude



[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom

Rock City
Royce five nine
Slim Shady
Come on

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
Can't stop the hustle, Royce nickel nine
Glock stops the tussle, nine shots'll bust you
Pine box, they'll stuff you, fuck you, I am not the tussle
Niggas don't know me, I'm Detroit's king nigga, bow!
Rock City's where the niggas pimp hoes and ball
Strip hoes in bars, steal clothes from malls
As long as your city's got the
Bombs and your city's got the
Arms and your city's got the
Titties sagging looking like they got forearms
Gold bottles, green bottles, Cris' to the don
Niggas get popped for selling weed, shaked with seeds
If you hate me you hate the D, nigga please
I'm taking shit back to the riots in the sixties
Think I'm lying? Visit me (Where you live)

Suburban and city niggas hustle together
Long as it's money involved, niggas'll tussle together
Long as the hustle's a hustle, the green is green
White is white, nigga we buying if the price is right
So, drop the mics, everything's on cock
From the shots to the dice, we are not into hype (nope)
You can't say we can't work
Either we some plant workers or we some niggas that plant work
What? Detroit bitches is 'bout it
You can just ask any one of your niggas that visit about it
Any seven mile bitch know how to get rich
She'll fuck you 'til you sleep plus lie to your bitch
Plus she'll suck and swallow up outta your dick
And she'll keep a sugar daddy that'll buy her some shit, come on

The city with the bars, where the goons
Where the cars is produced, here we are with the

[Verse 3: Royce da 5’9”]
New casinos, car shuffles, numbers to bet
Disrespect and get a new smile under your neck
A city full of thug-ass niggas, and punk-rockers
A lot of niggas act like Pac, so cops watch 'em
Them shot blocks up in the black or the light Timbs
White boys look, act, and rap like Slim (hi)
Fight Music, knife users never respect it
Guns talk, high schools with metal detectors
A city full of Tommy Hearns thumpers
Grant Hill hoopers, Barry Sanders runners, stunners
Chaldeans with weed-connects like whoa
Type of weed, no need to test like 'dro
Type of cats who got dough, they like - so?
You real then you might go, where?

[Chorus: Eminem]

Show you what the rock stars all about
It's been a while, I'm coming out
Doing laps around Jimmy Iovine's house
I don't drive, I got a chauffer to pick me up
Big old truck that's all beat up (hahaha)
Blue Cadillac, Diamond in the Back
(Dr. Dre's on line one)
Tell him to call me back
I'm too busy to take his call!
I'm at the mall, collecting girls' drawers (yea !)
This Rock Star stuff is the life for me
June 28, buy my CD

[Intro: Black Thought]
L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fail
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers wanna do this well
Rock the bells

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells

[Verse 5: Eminem]
The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells

[Verse 6: Black Thought and Eminem]
[Black Thought] So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
[Eminem] All you're gonna be, wanna be, when will you learn
Wanna be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six Gs for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
[Black Thought] I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson, [Eminem] we like Cool J
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well
Rock the bells



[Intro: Eminem]
Yo
Yo, Manix, man
I think it's about (time) to tell the ladies out there how it is, you know what I'm saying?
Um, I forgot what I wanna know
Um, something about women
So kick that fly ass original beat and bust a funky ass sample
And we'll go get smooth (?) for 1990
Word, V Top?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ayo, slut
I just wanna bust a nut in your butt
I don't care if you hate my guts, 'cause guess what
I don't have no fear since I just love the feeling of your dick when you're kneeling
If you've got a mare in your (?) come in and dance with me
And let's get sultry, it'll knock you high
And we can have our own private (?)
So honk if you're horny and you wanna get whorey
I'm far from a dud, I'm wiser than Bud, more dirty than mud, (?) the star, you wanna jump on my pud
And fuck me, fuck me baby, hug me, suck me until my dick turns ugly
So hey, come on and try me, gimme the opportunity to bang you until your pussy turns slimy
In ten minutes I can make your head swirl when I knock you with my cock and rock your world
(?)

[Hook: V-Top]
Oh, ooh girl, I wanna rock your world
We, we, we, suck my cock for me pretty please
Don't eat the honey, don't eat the honey, I want you to pull me
I want you to finger yourself for me

[Hook: V-Top]
All night long I want you to do the nasty
Oh, woah girl, I wanna rock your world
We, we, we, we, suck my cock for me pretty please
Don't eat, don't eat, I want you to pull me
I want you to finger yourself for me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You know what I hate? (What?)
Is when I take a girl on a date and try to get great and they tell me that I gotta wait
So then I gotta wait for
To watch, flip her and rip her like paper
Then I go for her next door neighbour
So she can give or take my guns home but I guarantee in '27 she'll be wanting to phone home
To say she don't wanna do it now 'cause she's on her (?)
But she's making a (?) say that she don't get an asshole (?)
But I expected much with most ladies act
(?) 'cause they can't handle the sex maniac
So why not get in the pan 'cause these hoes were like Nylon
So happy time I gotta rely on
Oh ye faith, put the cock, fingers up her cunt (?) I guess I gotta degrade
So I sit and whine, I dream about the day that I can finally find me a girl that'll let me rock her world

[Hook: V-Top]
Oh, woah, baby please let me rock your world
Oh, we, we, we, suck my cock for me
Yeahhhhhhhhh



[Intro]
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

[Chorus]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me



[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
A hellspawn droppin' a stealth bomb
Six mics in The Source, they borrowed one from LL's arm
You beef with me, I'm a even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too funny off of twenty Nō-Dōz
Hop on a snowboard and hit a tree harder than 'Sonny' Bono
So if I said I never get buzzed
That would mean I lie and get butt more than the president does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I took her freakin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out wit' has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Talk back, fake sick, get out of school, steal from people
And don't think before you do somethin' that's illegal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Fry from an overload and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm 'posed to teach kids how to behave?

[Hook 1]
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat 'shrooms, then O.D
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]

Are you feeling good about the album at this point?
Um, that's a tough question, man. For the most part, yeah. But I don't know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out. With every record that I put out, someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music, I just hear flaws in it. Like I hear 'Oh fuck! I could have done this better or that better!' And I'll work it to death. Obviously if I wasn't comfortable with it, I wouldn't put it out. But from the beginning, ever since my career started, I don't know if I've ever been totally like, this is completely it.

In this last crunch, what have you been working on?
I guess you would say last minute jitters of "Fuck! Are the vocals loud enough? Can you hear what I'm saying on this part? Is the beat right? Are the vocals too loud?'" If I could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that I rapped over and put them out, I would do that. 'Cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it.

But you're not changing lyrics or anything like that? It's just all mix and sound stuff? It's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part, because when I decide to keep a song, that's pretty much it. Like, if it doesn't work, I pretty much know right away, right when I get it in the car and take it home.

Rolling Stone's Review of Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP 2

So why did you dye your hair blonde again?
Um, I'll say that one was [manager Paul Rosenberg's] idea. In the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit I had thought about it. And once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be, he hit me with the idea and I was like "Yo, you know I thought about that, right?" And he was like, "Well you know, why not?" And I was like "I don't know how it's gonna look. I haven't had it in how many fucking years? Five, six years." I was like, "I'm so used to it being dark," you know. So I just tried it. And I was like "Fuck it."

Did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording?
Not really, honestly. Because I already had most of the songs. And I don't know if I'm gonna keep it like this or how long I'm gonna keep it. But for right now it is what it is. And I feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record.

For Recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff. You recorded 100 songs or something, or at least you had 100 beats. So was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around?
I feel like right now I'm probably working harder than I've ever worked in my life. And I've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during The Eminem Show, which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time. Just being so busy with The Eminem Show and doing the 8 Mile movie, and the soundtrack and the score to the movie. This is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly.

That's crazy.
Once I had the direction that I wanted to go, and you know calling it The Marshall Mathers LP 2, obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations. Like, I wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that. So I wanted to make sure that I had the right songs to be able to call it that. So, a lot of recording. A lot of songs that people probably will never hear. We hit a couple of road blocks. There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever. And just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like, "Fuck man! I feel like it needs this or this" to paint the whole picture.

A lot of people, maybe even you, think the original is your best album.
It's probably my favorite. I think some of them are my favorites for different reasons. Hate to even say that about my own record, but I mean the first three records, I think they may have captured a time period. And then I think I pretty much probably have publicly said, you know, Encore and Relapse wasn't – it was just a different time.

You've been hard on Relapse, but Tyler, the Creator says that it's his favorite hip-hop record in years. He loves that record.
Yeah, he tells me that every time I see him. I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like "Ha ha this is funny!" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the ground. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.

On Recovery, obviously the world came to you on that one. How do you feel now about that record?
I feel like that record I finally got back to where I was at maybe during The Eminem Show. Like, creatively and songwriting, I guess. I mean obviously Recovery was the first time I had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp. Aside from working with Dre, it was like I always wanted to produce my own records, because producing is fun to me too. One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them. It's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them. The way that I do music is, like, regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have, I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can. So regardless if the beat feels like "Wow maybe this could be played on the radio," I'm not like, "Maybe radio would play this so I'll just wing it." Like, I always have looked at it like I want to approach every record from an MCs' aspect.

So how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP? How did you decide to make your life miserable like that?
Well here's what it is: It's not necessarily a sequel.

Okay.
As much as it is a revisitation – like this is a different time period in my life. So there's not gonna be like, continuations of every song or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia. One of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new, older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that. You know, retro shit, and try to make it current, like bring it up to date.

So did seeking out Rick Rubin come from that direction? You were like "Why don't I go back to the source?"
Paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and I was like, "Fuck man." Another thing with this record is that I kind of got back into producing more. On Recovery, I wanted to focus more on writing, and not have to worry abut making the beats. On Relapse I think it was mostly all Dre. So I kind of started producing again a little bit. I was kind of in the middle of that when Paul had mentioned that, and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and I don't know if that's what made Paul reach out to Rick or if Rick reached out to him. But as soon as I heard he was interested I was like, "Yo, just let me finish this up and let's go see him."

You've called Rick "Yoda" – was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career?
[Yoda voice] Learning I did. Um, yeah, I mean the best part about Rick's vibe is he's very Zen-like in the sense of just "Let it happen." The weird thing about it is nine times out 10, we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right, you know. He's almost like a coach.

He's very psychological, right?
Yeah the guy's got his shoes off. [Laughs] Working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere. He's not afraid to try anything. I kind of felt in the same way I felt, and still feel to this day, as far as like wanting to impress Dre. We talked at his house and then I think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats. I told him that I had started experimenting with some more retro sounds. So we just sat down and started picking shit out and I would start writing to them and next time I'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it. The dude's got so many ideas, man. One of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the Rick Rubin scratches. When he fucking scratches some shit, it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it. Not that it's off-time or anything like that, but it's just like – it's fucking weird. I don't even know how to explain it. You just know that he scratched it. I don't know if that even makes sense or not. It's like a simple scratch, like a basic kind of thing, but it's so fucking dope when you hear it. It's just, it's vintage him. And plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit.

Did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio?
Oh, he's got some shit in the stash. Yeah. Definitely.

So much has changed in hip-hop since you started producing – did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff?
Um, not necessarily, because like I feel like I just do whatever feels right. Obviously I pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse. But I don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing. That's no offense to anyone else.

Basically, if there are outside influences that are current, you let that come in from the other producers, but your shit is your shit.
Yeah. That's exactly it. More current-sounding shit I leave to them. And not that I don't feel like my shit sounds current, but it's not the exact same thing. And I think I've updated as well.

On the new song "Legacy" you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid. What does it take to get back in that mindset at your age?
I always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said, "He ain't shit" or bullied or whatever. It felt like one of them self-empowerment songs. Everybody, I believe, wants to show the world that, "One day I'm gonna be this. One day I'm gonna be that." Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them. Like, if you haven't been kicked or whatever, if you never went through. . .

Tribulations.
Tribulations and shit like that, then you're perfect and fuck you anyways. So everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted. Like, "You don't matter." "Oh yeah? I'm gonna show you." So it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy – into what I leave behind when I'm gone. And I always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me. There's many, many songs that got me through a lot of shit.

I just love that you rhyme "Onyx" with "comics" on that song.
I don't know if anyone will get this, like this is super-nerdy, but the rhyming words in that song never change. And that's just one of the things that I do to try to challenge myself. I wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed.

You've praised the Beastie Boys' evolution, but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a "the disrespect for women has got to be through" moment.
I mean, listen, my sense of humor has certainly not gone away. I realize that I'm an adult, a grown-ass man, and I don't know what I'll be doing a year from now, 10 years from now, but I don't think that my tongue-in-cheekness will ever go away. I guess it's just a part of my personality. I always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well. If one song is darker or talking about a sad subject, I don't want to make a whole album of that, of being a downer. I don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity. You gotta try and find that right balance, and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting. In other words, recording till I get it. And if I record 100 fucking songs and I don't have what I feel like I need yet to make the body of work, then I'm gonna keep going and keep recording.

You've written a bunch of your own hooks, and even sing some of them. Where does your sense of melody come from?
That's a good question. I would want to say that it's stemming from early hip-hop. Rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies, at least on the shit that I grew up on. I don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is. I can only hum something. But I think it just comes from all the data that I've collected in my years of listening to music. And you know, fuck man, I think that as hip-hop started evolving, there was more melody in it, people were starting to sing hooks. Even like, early Slick Rick – [sings] "Hey young world" – those kind of things. Maybe I took it somewhere different at times, I don't know.

Maybe it's just pure instinct.
Honestly, that's probably what it is. I don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but I just don't know where I get that sense from, you know what I'm saying? I'm not a singer singer. I just know what's in key and what's not.

Having Kendrick Lamar on your album, did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you?
I completely respect what Kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp, that he's on Aftermath, only made sense to me. He came to Detroit, we kicked it for a few minutes, you know, and I felt the vibe of what he's like and everything, and you know, he's a super cool and super humble dude. When we did that record, I think that was actually a week or two before he did the verse to "Control."

Is there advice you would give him at this point?
I don't know if he needs advice. He seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders, man. He's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one. He's like a hip-hop head, man, he just loves hip-hop. And obviously the way that he did the "Control" verse, it was almost like if you get mad at him, then you might look foolish. He set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking. Or you should be thinking.

Fundamentally, do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog?
I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole "Rap God" record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that's why Kendrick's verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking, If you don't want to be the best, then why are you rapping?

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up; flatscreen
Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki," asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars; sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho; punt
Forced trauma; blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag-a-lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie; camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Hook: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Verse 2: Eminem as Slim Shady]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch!
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?"
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask "Why not?")

[Hook: Eminem as Slim Shady]
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill; mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning Eli!!

[Verse 4: Eminem as Slim Shady]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's (high class) meets (white trash)

[Hook: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Outro: Nicki Minaj as Martha Zolanski]
Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys



[Kuniva as his alter ego Rondell]
Yo, Yo. What's up, what's going on?
Uhh, Marshall in there?
(Nah, nah, he in there working out right now
You gon' have to wait for a minute)
Well he's expecting me, I gotta get through there; I have something to tell him

[Eminem]
Oh, oh I was gonna uhm, I was gonna send it to you
[Kuniva]
Send it to me? You were gonna-
[Eminem]
Yeah, I was gonna send it to you
Uhm, I was gonna lay it, uhh, tomorrow
[Kuniva]
You don't even have an address on me, boy
I just got outta jail
[Eminem]
Well...
[Kuniva]
You ain't come to visit or nothin'
[Eminem]
You were in solitary. They said, they said you killed a guard
[Kuniva]
Look, never mind that
Look, look, before I got locked up, I put my stash up. Okay?
[Eminem]
Uhuh
[Kuniva]
Soon as I got out, I got my stash, and when I found it, guess what I found?
A beat tape, I got a beat tape

[Intro: Rob May & 2Pac]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Outro: 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, "Again?" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, "whoa", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that



[Intro: 2Pac]
I'm not saying I'm going to rule the world or I'm going to change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world and that's our job. It's to spark somebody else watching us. We might not be the ones, but let's not be selfish and because we not gonna change the world, let's not talk about how we should change it...

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: Bure]
Ayo, I'm taking it back to the '00
Back to Austell, Georgia, the world was finna know
A name that would ring out, taking on its glow
Forgetting the woes and just putting on a show
Look, EP and IT, you know they was so tight
Complement each other so well it took 'em to higher heights
First born a year before
After that, it went boy, girl, boy just the score
Streets of ABZ got 'em
They had something to live for, they ain't know about starting from the bottom
Doing their best, they excelled
They ain't know nobody, had to keep people from walking on eggshells
This world I ain't seeing no changes
Been knowing people from time, but still look at me like a stranger
I'm not Pac, I don't get around
Everybody throw your weapons down on the battleground

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 2: Bure]
Look, Death Row, don't blow indo
Solo, Van Gogh, wait till I plateau
Look, Bad Boy, no tot's toy
In my way I'm looking to destroy
I'm feeling no-notorious
And glorious and maybe a little victorious
From the ABZ to Leicester
You know I ain't trying to test ya
I'm just wondering why you feel like the guy and why you feel the need to go and big up your chest, yeah
'Cause you ain't hard, you fallin' under the bar
And no one's gonna pick you up like they was driving a car
I'm stealthy like jaguar, I ball like an All-Star
Calm down and please be easy
I don't want you feeling queasy
I don't even really want you moving sleazy, just believe me
Everything's gonna be easy-breezy
'Cause everybody's ready for the return of Y Beezy
Look

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Outro]
Look, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Look, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Yeah, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
One more time, look, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

[Spoken Outro: Bure & 2Pac]
You're for a lot of things: your music, your acting, your style, the way you carry yourself, but in your opinion, what is your most defining attribute or feature about you?

My big mouth, my big mouth. I got a big mouth, can't help it. I talk from my heart, I'm real, you know what I'm saying, whatever comes comes

Oh man, I feel that Pac, I feel that! You often wrote about social issues like racism, police brutality, poverty and you even touched on a little politics sometimes, you know? I remember listening to "2Pacalypse Now" one of these days and I was listening to the lyrics and they were all talking about calls for change within society. Vice President Quayle, he said this about you at the time, listen to this. He said "There's no reason for a record" being 2Pacalypse Now "like this to be released, it has no place in our society", this is what he said. What would you say that album meant to your people and to you personally?

And we shouldn't be angry, and the raps that I'm rapping to my community should not be filled with rage, you know what I'm saying? It shouldn't be filled with the same atrocities that they gave to me. The media, they don't talk about it, so in my raps, I have to talk about it and it just seems foreign because there's no one else talking about it

Yeah man, I see what you saying, man. Yeah, that album did mean a lot to a lot of your listeners and your followers, so I'm glad you took the time out to, you know, clear that up and I got one more question before you go, Pac, before I let you go. A lot of people would say, "Oh, he's got the money, he's got the fame, he's got the publicity, he's pretty much got everything at this point in his career. What does he need to complain about?" What would you tell them? Why would you do these things? Why do you do these things? Why do you express how you feel in your music and take it back to the place you came from?

I'ma tell you. Um, it's like being the last person alive, you know what I'm saying? After three days, you can't do anything. What can I do? Where can I go? There's no, there's no black neighbourhood, you know what I'm saying, where black people will have the same amount of money as me, you know what I'm saying? There's richer and there's poorer, there's no just, you know, did a movie, got a little bit of money, living okay black neighbourhood. I have to be in a white neighbourhood, so I don't fit in, that's hell. It's hell when you can't be around your peers. All my life, grew up around black people, poor people, but I can't live around poor people now because they'll rob me. And why will they rob me? Because they're starving, 'cause there's no money here, but they're telling me now that I've made a little money, I have to move here. So it's not like no one's ever tying to deal with this section, they just moving away from it and we're gonna have more stars coming from the ghetto, they're gonna all move this way, you know what I'm saying?

Yeah man, yeah. Look Pac, I just wanna, I wanna thank you for allowing me to do this with you and allowing me to sit down and pick your brain a little and seeing different sides to an argument and um, yeah man, you're an inspiration to so many and over your illustrious career, you've created music that cannot be replicated and that's extremely special and I really do, again, wanna thank you for letting me do this and hopefully we can do this again sometime, so I appreciate it Pac, thank you

I appreciate y'all giving me the opportunity to clear all that stuff up. And I'ma represent for y'all and I'ma always give you the opportunity to ask me whatever questions you wanna ask me, whatever way you wanna ask me without me trippin'. And at the same time, I want y'all to always, just when I give you the story, now it's up to you becuase you are our reporters, it's up to you give it without putting me in jail through what I told you, you know what I mean, without giving out the facts. It's up to you to let the people know what's really poppin'



[Intro: Pace Won]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Come on!)
D.U., what up! (Yo, yo)
Show me love, baby, show me love
Come on! Outsidaz
Eminem, Az-Izz! Outsidaz!

[Hook: Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what!

Crush your chick, touch your trick, what!
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what!
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what!
Outz in the area tearing things up

[Verse 1: Az-Izz]
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skee'd off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

[Verse 2: Pace Won]
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock
Twice for my block, I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck, throw up your hands, what?
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

[Hook: Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)

Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

[Verse 3: Slang Ton & Eminem]
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack booty
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills or steal my reel-to-reels (Here, look!)
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded, I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top and then repeat it (Ha)
Write it down on the paper and still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged
Out; I been down with the Outz for ten thou-
Sand years (So dunn, here?)
To the weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh? Hill? (There's more than one, ill!)
What? You want me to stop? Here?

[Hook: Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

[Verse 5: Young Zee]
Yeah, your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dickhead (AHH!)
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave (Errrrr!)
Yeah, we all OD off Valiums
What be the outcome? We selling twenty million albums
And your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five back
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

[Verse 6: Axe]
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
Eff with we, what you expect to see?
Death's your destiny
When it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back
Like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

[Hook: Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

[Outro: Pace Won]
C'mon yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Outworld baby



[Intro]
Yeah
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight, yo

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, “Well, hello Tonya”
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 2]
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like "Hello, my love"
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Outro]
Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance



[Chorus]
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself laying on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standing here swinging on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around, saw Gary stashing the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, ‘cause I don't wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once
‘Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad ‘cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growing up to be like his fucking ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick
"Publicity stunt" my ass, "conceal" my fucking dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seeing
Everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceeing
It's fucking crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm saying

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood

[Outro]
Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fucking star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm going back home)



[Intro: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
So I'm out the game, huh?
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever
Haha, well, I'm with you, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much
Knew too much shit, corrupt
And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
(But what about Jermaine?) Fuck Jermaine!
He don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews
And see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-yous
Running around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10- or 11-year-olds

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup
If you ever mix me up or confuse me
With a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
We'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fucking-gain
Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry
That could save it when I'm gone and buried
To make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fucking head off
‘Cause I know if they get up
I won't get a chance to let off another punch
I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck: white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (C'mon!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alizé, partying all day
But I handled my business, ‘cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
‘Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryin' to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone
And I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad
And I can pull any string; don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest
In something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day, like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source? Ain't holding my fucking breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fucking check

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Outro: Dr. Dre & Timbaland]
Watch your fucking mouth!
Yo, this' Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dick!



[Intro: Eminem + (Royce Da 5'9")]
What's your favorite scary movie?
Yo, Slim Shady (Yo, Royce 5'9")
Y'all wanna make a movie? (What, what?)
We got the film right here

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they namin' the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is comin' soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leavin' all of you cats shittin' kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cockin' pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin' the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packin' semi
Speak darts — yo, you get paid?
Rhymin' about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9", a street nigga with deep feelin'
I keep illin', my steez willin' to keep killin'
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks: one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, "It's on!" – then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claimin' you pissed off

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle'll get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this — and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin' taken advantage of, like Monica Lewinsky (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
Screamin' to Aunt Peg
With three spokes stickin' outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin' you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than gettin' hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

[Outro: Eminem + (Royce Da 5'9")]
Bad, the Bad (Uhh, when the Bad meets the Bad, yo)
The Evil (Take the Evil with the Evil)
Put 'em together (What? Nine-nine)
Two times, Slim Shady, Royce da 5'9"

As a producer who has worked with Detroit wordsmith Eminem early on his career, Scott Storch was asked to share his earliest memories of the rapper during a recent interview with Mikey T The Movie Star

Storch says he was introduced to Eminem through Dr. Dre who doted on Em’s lyrical skills. The New York beatsmith also revealed that he was surprised to find that Eminem was “another white dude" upon meeting the rapper

“I remember I was working with Dr. Dre,” Storch said. “And he was telling me about Marshall. I mean, I had heard about him from his Rawkus days. But he was telling me ‘Oh, I got this dude [called] Eminem. He’s ridiculous. He’s like the best rapper I swear to God in the world. Blah blah blah blah blah.’ And he came in and I wasn’t expecting like for another white dude to be walking in the room. I thought I was the only white dude. And then I didn’t know he was speaking up this guy that’s this most amazing rapper is coming in.”

Storch went on to comment on Eminem’s creativity and energy in the studio, qualities he says he sees in Chris Webby, an artist he’s currently working with

“I remember that day we were fixing up a record of his and we did that ‘Just The Two Of Us’ that day,” he said. “And I don’t know—I was blown away then. He was something completely different. He reminds me of—like his energy and just all his creativity—like the greatest. And I saw something the other night in this dude I’m working with, Chris Webby. And it kinda reminded me a little bit of that type of vibe. Really into the craft and excited about the records…I remember being in the studio at some point. I forget what album it was with Em. And Em was going so crazy. He was so passionate about just adding like all the little sound effects to the songs. Like a glass breaking or anything, a car screeching. The sounds. Like all that stuff and just being so meticulous with it and making it real.”

In addition to working with Eminem, Storch also reportedly worked with Dr. Dre on his much-delayed album, Detox. Nearly four years ago the producer revealed that Dre’s album was only three tracks away from completion during an interview with DJ Skee

Following his return to music last year, Scott Storch has worked with the likes of Fat Joe, Pusha T, DJ Khaled, and a handful of other artists



[Intro: Angela Workman]
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness
And the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember
Kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin'
I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin' you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush
And answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me
"I love you" (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found

[Hook: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus
You can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Pérignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze, the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thang that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the women that I'm speakin' to
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do
So, now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the négligée

[Hook: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you



Eminem:]
Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby

[Hook x2:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

[Ludacris:]
Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name?
Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
Start up ya own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change
Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need
Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me
But I can't hold my tongue

[Hook x2:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

[Lil Wayne:]
Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch a 10 g's tell a bitch to go shopping
She buy herself some clothes, and she bought me back a chopper
See niggas tryna kick it, but no I don't play sucka
I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And enough for one key I see seventy thousand dollas
Now I was shootin dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with Yo Gotti, he hit five straight points
We ova here hustlin, we ova here grindin
You rap about money and nigga might sign ya
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya
Banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya
DOPE GAME BITCH let his mamma worry bout him
You can holla at me for a fee

[Hook x4:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side



[Intro: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Like a verbal seduction when
Seduction when I tell 'em girls on the star
I don't know, man (Geh-geh-geh)
Just feels like we're a lot different (Right now)
(Girls on the star) It kinda feels like (Like a verbal seduction when)
I'm on a whole different page right now than you (Girls on the star)
It feels strange, but umm (Girls on the star)
I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, "C'mon, son!"
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, "She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some"
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
She's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl? Come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premiere
Seducin' her, loosen up
With a little freestyle that'll— wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick... aw, fuck

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)



[Eminem]
What's up with everybody beefin'
Everybody seem like they wanna beef
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody beefin' with everybody
This shit is crazy

[Verse 1: Dogmatic]
This is a bomb scare, fires on your hair
Terrorists live here, but I don't care
I'm making pot holes when I stomp, so don't stare
I stop to stomp competiton, with both fair
How dare, little soldier at ease
We shake down these streets, like Parkinson's Disease
We parking the road trees, plus load the weapons
Everything to six shooters, to high tech ones
If a green beans things, to my suggestion
Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion
With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic
An underground nigga but this nigga's above average
It's serious! who can understand what I'm saying?
Yo Slim, tell them niggas (Eminem: We ain't playing!)
It's like you open a can of worms or smoked yams
I got bloody hands and burners that make you dance!

[Hook: Eminem]
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type a brother that'll, fuck yo mother, wit a fishnet rubber
I'mma misfit slash, nitwit
I love to put up biscuts, straight to a niggas lips, it'll fit
A biligerent and rowdy fellow
I'll dump yo body, and still fly away to Maui, on a teller
When it comes to beefin', it ain't no explain'
I'll change ya lauguage, wit a stainless
I'll contain, wit a name which to make you famous
I'mma deranged pit, I'll bend you till ya back touch ya anus
Don't ever take me to court, I'll whack the plantiff
Then beat the fuck out the baliff
A heinous, miscellaneous, nigga never miss, when the AK lift
I paint ya face wit, any weapon, just like "The Matrix"
They ain't steppin', don't even say shit
You heard about the bodies in my basement, you joinin' them, face it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Proof]
Laugh indictive, like Kim lipstick, and get a nose bleed
My blow speed, is like my hands working ten stick shifts
Captain ask, to stick my finger in the barrel of a Mac 10
And snatching the driver out the black Benz
Smashing his contact lens, my life start when his contract ends
"Go kiss-and-tell, and contact Kim!"
Let's be factually, actually, y'all ain't after me
Got (???) wit +Regis+, y'all beef is without the +Kathy Lee+
Told y'all my battlery, and go to war happily
How you gon' call my bluff, when you scared to send a fax to me
My factulty guns drawn, one wrong move dudey
And it's too heads on ya body, into a gangster movie
For lot being real, scared to pop wit the steel
It got skeletons in my house, every closet is filled
Now how does it feel, with this Baretta to ya dome
And to know that ya mom's know, that you was never coming home

[Hook] w/ Ab-libs

[Outro: Eminem]
You know what I'm sayin'
You want beef, we taking it to yo face
Fuck it, Dirty Dozen, Slim Shady
D-12, this shit is serious!



[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
You ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in
Trouble! What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end
Deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down
Like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
{rapid gunfire} FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screaming, "Fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me
Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear
And ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo, where the FUCK you at?

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well, when you look at my pee
And this joint no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose
After they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edimminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked
And your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala
I bear more arms than 6 koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin
(Slaughterhouse!) 'Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?



[Intro]
Comin' to you live at Shade 45 Invasion

[Verse 1]
Comin' to you live at Shade 45 Invasion
The only radio station that plays in rotation
The Shady the slash with the Aftermath with the little Jay on occasion
Maybe you may hear some Jada mixed with a plate of some D Block
Splash of 2Pac
One being that we don't cater cause we gonna play the fuck
Outta whatever we want this is Shady
And we gonna pump, pump the fuck out our own shit
From 50, Obie, Twizzy, Stat Quo
And we won't quit fuckin' you up
And we can keep sayin' fuckin' you up
Even till the FCC sayin' shut this dude up
Duck tape a his mouth a do somethin'
Quick fucka do fuck poppa do pop
Skippy dippy pop shit bitch asshole you son of a bitch! Chinga tu madre!
I start drama all day hemm delala
Comin' across your scanners it's the brand new station
Shade 45, motherfuckin' Slim Shady bitch and Green Lantern
Shady in the place to be, see
And it takes what I got to rock the mic right
And that was a freestyle too bitch so suck my dick if you do not like



Hey, what’s a demon?
A demon is fun, a lot more fun…

[Intro: Obie Trice]

Guess who’s back from Shady’s faction
You gotta know that cuz you made him Platinum
‘case you look past ‘em and ask him
Is OT alright? I say easy bastards
Thought I wouldn’t come back? Nigga you backwards?
He came from crack to obtaining his classics
Knowin’ all that, get your ass in action
Cuz now you have access to what’s happenin’

[Verse One: Obie Trice]

The flows eccentric
O is back with a mouth full of inventions
To hold my fans
‘Til the next album comes, like my second one has
Cheers was slept on, it’s a thing of the past
I guess got some ?? made ‘em all laugh
When I shoulda been strapped, up with gats
But, I’m from the Ave so what’s up with that?
Cuz on previous tracks Obie’s clutchin’ mags
Look at him kickin’ with fat chicks why would he brag?
What possesses him to do a song like that?
Shut the fuck up!
My nigga what’s up?
Cats with no humor, in the club mugged up
You gon’ get a facial tumor
Assuming that that looks persuasive or invasive to him
This is neither the time or place to pursue him
Baby party it up with Shady, under the influence

[Hook: Eminem]

You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
Yea were wilin’, yea were crazy!
(Whoo) Yea come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo)

You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
(Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us
Throw me in the club let’s get fucked up!

[Verse Two: Obie Trice]

Okey dokey, Obie’s back in the lab runnin’ the track
On my second lap, ahead of these fags
Marshall Mathers laced the track
So I ride that as if he would have
Havin’ a blast with a half a glass of Cognac
Next to my pen and pad
If I wanna get my abs intact call Curtis Jack for that
Make chicks have asthma attacks
The reaction is massive on the ??
Shut the fuck up!
My bitches what’s up?
Cats that perfuming in the club hugged up
You should get a different human
Assumin’ the dude you’re in tune with is wearing PINK
Instincts to tell you he’s a freak
He ain’t interested in you, he’s lookin’ at G
(Hahaha)

[Hook: Eminem]

You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
Yea were wilin’, yea were crazy!
(Whoo) Yea come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo)

You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
(Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us
Throw me in the club let’s get fucked up!

[Verse Three: Obie Trice]

No rehearsals the flow is cursed
I spit it in cursive you know it’s curtains
Return with a banger that’s so assertive
DJ spinnin’ ‘em in circles certainly
Hence the urgency, servin’ them since the birth of me
Get an intense verse from Obie – Wan Kenobi
One and only, nothing like a phony
Coordinate and macaroni
Plus I clap your homie
Actin’ like he ain’t have access to madness
??
Fuck that, let’s relax a moment
Before we fuck around over react and blow it
Do it for the folks those who know how to act enjoyment
Actually this is Shady gatherin’, spoil it
It’ll beat that ass like a Prince performance

[Hook: Eminem]

You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
Yea were wilin’, yea were crazy!
(Whoo) Yea come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo)

You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
(Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us
Throw me in the club let’s get fucked up!



[Directed by Syndrome]

[Verse 1: KXNG Crooked]
KXNG Crooked, Eastside, Long Beach, California
My name is KXNG Crooked
I snap on you rappers often
When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across
Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'
Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we Willie Lynch 'em
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground
Like every bar is a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam
Like god damn
Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam
Bam, bam your body drop, Van Damme, karate chop
The Beretta's a better competitor
Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
Killin' you and whoever in that drop top
Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot
And beaucoup, beaucoup, I'm cuckoo
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku
I'm worlds apart from you rappers
Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping
Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
When I come back, that's it
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I
When I land, you wack niggas die
And your casket is your last hit
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
Back to the hand clappin'
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson
Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan
Passin' niggas with pants saggin'
With their hand on a black Magnum
To clap him backwards
So their last words is "kcuf meht nmad saggin"
That's backwards for "fuck them damn niggas"
Buck them damn triggers
Charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers
'Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
But I only like dead rappers
Compare me to the best rappers who died
And you rappers I used to look up to
I gotta cancel you now
Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex factors survive
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightnin' strike
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin', I dwarf giants
I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'
I smoke philosophy, I snort science
That means I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
That's where the fire's burnin'
Try to deny a music messiah's returnin'
You die and you fry in my iron furnace
I am on my get rich or die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis
'Cause I am murderous

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Joe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey
Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends
Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs
Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS
But the bars there, put that on God, ask an atheist
And if I ain't the bomb at least I'm in the blast radius
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now
Fuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now
So it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
Face says I been stressed
I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo
Shit that bothered from the start
'Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart
Yeah, just not the side that the beat is on
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready
These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
Not a how do I feel, not a how do I deal
If that’s the life, then nigga, how is it real?
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers
Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears
But wait, wildest part of all of that is
They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
But fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
House Gang, Shady, I'm gone, nigga, my job is done

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama
My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama
Here's the back story:
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills
I don't know which one's which or what it's for
Safety ain't really a habit I've formed
I still smoke to the cigarette butt
I still drink till I end up being that klutz
Clumsy, self-destructive dummy
Stumbling over my words, mumbling
I'll probably do it tonight
Leave the bar, leave the car
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
And dream about that light that leads up to the lord
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
Wake up feeling like half a human
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
But unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne the god and Lord Jamar thought it would be
Wait a minute... the lord and the god hate me
Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!
Nah...
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be
Wanna take a tour? Let's see
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion
Bucks, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers
Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call
Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
Lift kits, low riders, chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots
Dixie flags, American flags, Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass
CEO
I've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit
Guess who's coming to dinner?
André 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure
I've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just to pet and feed of course
Who rides a horse in Nashville? I might
I've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies
M-80s, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket
Moonshine, gold watches, gold rings
All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style
Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you
I've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat
All the latest CDs, mp3s, and Beats by Dre
Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check
I've got a black woman fine as she can be
FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
A 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter
I don't know where that came from
I got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work
Don't look under the tarp, sir
I'm growin' weed for my mama there
I've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley
And I did it my way
See, hip-hop is what you make of it
And I'm makin' a lot of it
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Joell Ortiz, Brooklyn, New York
But these cyphers?
I treat 'em like they a war; don't want no mediators
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
People thank you, I do this for all the mean creators
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at
Now they deem me a savior
But to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, man I just really like rap
Y'all lucky, trust me
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky
With the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me
Ugly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous
I was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out just who I really is
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude
I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move
No rubber groove on my shoes led to fights, so suspensions
I had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny 'cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter
That's a 3 and 1, I learned that in public school too
Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece
For this Heatmakerz beat and Brother's Keeper 1
Simple mathematics, I'm addin' up to all these rap addicts
I don't like to divide dough so I multiply flow
And subtract maggots
Like a brand new Craftmatic, boy I'm back at it
Smokin' these new boys like my last habit
Dabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kick's like the last dragon
Hoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon
I just gotta laugh 'cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag
I'm pushin' this big ole Hearse, don't get body bagged

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
Royce Da 5'9", Detroit, gah
These new rappers be askin' me
Why I don't be hangin' out where they be hangin' out
I tell 'em, I say, "Lil nigga, listen here;"
If I don't got no business there, I don't got no business there
See there's a difference here
You hustlin' so you can be seen
Nigga I'm grindin' so I can disappear
I don't do it like other rappers do
When it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu
We got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
If you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out
Like Chico Bean
When there's drama I don't ask no questions, I just clap in that direction
I look at this gat like it's an actual accessory
I'm anti-social so relax when you step to me
Nigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry
Your lil' stare downs won't fare well
I got a pale conscience, I'm the grey area
The last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman
Now imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song
Nigga I'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws
Or run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on
I'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit
The only celebrity who give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch
Glock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst
Cripple your style, your first born child'll come out
With a colostomy bag as the afterbirth
I don't give a fuck
Nigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z
Stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest
Lookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby
Jump in the 4 door Mercedes with a .44 listenin' to JoJo and K-Ci
Drinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses
Maybe, this ebola for rabies
That's it, just livin' the rapper life
Banana clip in the air, lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight
MACs, I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin' up
I got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner
'Cause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is
I'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me
Mack magnet, attractin' enormous green
Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack
'Cause this bitch is that war machine
Life of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft
Drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk
We both got marketing plans
Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before
Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
And then go invest into a grocery store
Rolled up with the Smith & Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now
I do numbers, I turn you and your crew into two plumbers
Translation, get your shit together and pipe down
Fuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit
I'll shoot you and your sis if you insist
I got my eyes on the sparrow
Silencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel
And he doin' this

[Verse 6: Eminem]
My name is Marshall. I'm reppin' that motherfuckin' Motor City, bitch
I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet
Began to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet
Made shit as ill as it can get went in-depth
Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
I'm already covered in sweat and I wasn't even ready to come in yet
AHH, let me set this drink down
Beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
Probably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile
And "Rap God" was a freestyle
Off the top of the dome piece while I was 'sleep on the couch
And I'm freestyling now
I need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow
It's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul
'Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal
I need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio
And went to South Beach with his talents
Scream "fuck you" on the way out and wink with a smile
This whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground
But right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out
'Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
What the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters?
Bunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
One swing and you're crowned
Knocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now
You think you fucking with me 'cause you sold like 300 thou?
Bitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
Reach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around
Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
And heave a child in a sinkhole on Cinco de Mayo
When I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
Mardi Gras beads in a towel
I just made that up
I don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual
But I'll show you a Mexican stand off
Between just these two amigos
'Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
But I sure as fuck think I know how read body English, no doubt
'Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically
The fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?
Royce, he came up in the shit with me
Never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me
Let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
Of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery
Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
So what in the fuck is a list to me?
I'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em
Heck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em
Ain't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out
But I could put a chain around my second album
And wear it as a neck medallion
Became a millionaire, went downhill from there
Became civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware
Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career
The fuck am I gonna do until then? This job is too fulfilling
Two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
And a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville
Into some children at the food pavilion at Build-A-Bear
Warrior's mind, I’m pro-hydrocodone euphoria
In the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring
I'm pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore I go four wheeler riding
Gory and violent and horrifying
You surely won't find no one more abhorring
Than I am with this retaliatory of rhyming for Gloria Steinem
But I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
I usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am
I guess I must've threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam
When I said I could use the sample 'cause you's a tramp
But look how you react to this trigger like
When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam
You're playing right into Lex Luthor's hand
It's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan
But fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan
I'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band
Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed
In his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't
Since honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try
Try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify
As a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride
And say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize
I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines
And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
Then I'm like dollar signs
But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
Is more of a knockout than Janay Rice
Play nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right
In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight
In plain sight of the elevator surveillance
Til her head is banged on the railing
Then celebrate with the Ravens
Never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants
I'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape
The aggression, rage and the anger
Cause leg restraints on the ankles
Heavy weights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
Just ain't enough to contain it
But I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on
Stage in a fucking negligée everyday and Liz Claiborne
Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson
Wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say
'Cause makeup ain't gonna cover
That eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
Peppersprayed with your face cut
Made my bank like a lay up
Off these effing skanks on the way up
Oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent
It's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches
Yes, I said seven, I measured it
Seven inches from the floor
While I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
At the Sheraton while I'm stretching it
Bitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
So if she's hesitant to get the hint
I'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with
Eloquent when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
Existential detriment to a lesbian devil
And the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
A separatist like a Chechnian rebel
Impressionist with a pencil
A pessimist, with his lips pressed against
The edge of this Red Bull
Pedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
SHADYXV as perplexing as
The last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse
When I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
When I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears
And these little Disney queers
Who use chicks for beards?
Just made that up too...
Oh and the Shady 2.0
We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls
'Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
So flows lose you as usual, so juvenile
2 year old when I go to the studio
It's only music but don't be foolish though
You don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
In my homie's Buick
Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it
When I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do
And I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart
In one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it
You couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
The day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it
Rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip
With the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women
I'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
They tryna get rid of me gadzooks
But I stiggity stand for the figgity flag
Of the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through
And if I catch you doing anything
Hindering or prohibiting that after I get me the
Tattoo of your lips on my ass I'ma be literally
Pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you, woooh!

Fuck it
Got it somewhere in there probably, I don't know



[Intro: 50 Cent & Green Lantern]
Yo!
This is an invasion
I repeat: you motherfuckers are being invaded
Shady Records
Aftermath
2003
We invadin' the streets to charge your motherfucking movie theatres
Ain't shit you can do without 'em
Eminem, Obie Trice, D12
50 Cent, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit
(It's not my plan, it's God's plan)
Invasion

[Adlibs, Samples & Scratches]
Shady Records!
Twist the streets back one more time
Invasion! Shady!
You don't feel it then it must be too real to touch
Invasion! Shady Records!
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
Invasion!
The industry don't understand
We, the illest shit ever
Get ready, 'cause this is about to get heavy
For all you slow motherfuckers I'ma break it down iller
The evil, the evil genius
That's the sound of the man
50 Cent!
I'm fucking with their mind
I'll make 'em press rewind
I ain't goin' nowhere, so you're used to me
Break your punk ass up
That's the sound of the man
Obie Trice!
That, that was street motherfucker!
Ya know that's my real name, please believe it
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth
That's the sound of the
Stepped in the ?, in the 44
It's my way of life
Just got a fettish for shootin'
Jails from the 44s, scattered over floors
That's the sound of the man
Eminem!
It's no rumour, I'm numero uno
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want
Come on, (I) more gangster, you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I'll shoot across your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man, watch your fucking mouth



[Intro / Spoken: Eminem]
Yeah!
God damn!
Feels like a long time don't it?
Did you miss us?
We missed you!
Ha!
Shady Narcotics
It's the Re-Up
Pussies!
And we're back
Myself
D12
50 Cent
Obie Trice
Stat Quo
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Ca$his, from Orange County
And I think it's about time we just cut the bullshit, let's go!



[Verse]
I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught
If your CD's on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park
No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dog
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart
I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'
Shit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit
On some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement
'Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in
Toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
Looking skantless as Hannibal's stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
(Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis
Gallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers
I bet'cha they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I’ll stand there and yell that at a wall
'Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables
Hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped
And I'll catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack like Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door's laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion, hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, she Slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
'Cause now she faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, and Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's "Control" verse
And perform "Fack" in concert ["Fack" plays]
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah
Still get along with this voice 'cause that's the "Monster"
So do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath
Everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio
(Na-ah) She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula, Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners
I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna



[Intro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Shady, Aftermath
(Look at that bitch, shit – hey!)
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna

[Bridge 2: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
We 'bout have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg with Eminem]
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Outro: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God!
I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!
You're comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy – and his boy, and his girl
Ha-ha, Nate Dogg!



[Intro: Eminem + (Bobby Creekwater)]
Woo! Shady, Aftermath (B-G-O-V)
Look at that bitch, shit! Hey!
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm losin' control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby creek!)

[Verse 1: Bobby Creekwater]
I bought a girl Patron, I get in the Henn', I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin' me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone 'cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin' everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin' to gain but migraines and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get'cha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party – turn the music up!
Let's get it started – go 'head and shake your butt!
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, everyday she be givin' it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Aw, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Interlude: Eminem]
Obie Trice!

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious, full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch?
True that, I had a few, Obie rollin' with brews
And Nathaniel annually knockin' the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit, then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Shady – you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie came to party
You better ask somebody

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Aw, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady!



[Eminem]
Slim Shady, asshole

[Royce]
For any nigga with guns
We got guns too
More heated
Ready to outgun you
It's too late I already outgunned you
You was around
You know the outcome too
Let's play, let me show you what Game is
Heartbreak, I'm showing you what pain is
Please, I'm repping the D homeboy
Where your guns, you stepping to me homeboy
Royce 5'9"'s the name, niggas know
And niggas know, dealing with me niggas know
Ayo toots, how you get here, you wanna ride
I got a five in Southside, you wanna drive
Psych, I ain't got no five, you gold digger
You wanna suga-daddy, go get you an old nigga
I got money, I'm just here to bug you girl
You can't get none, but you know I love you girl

[Refrain]
Yo she the one that wanna ride hot whips, huh
Same one that ain't really got shit, huh
She want her hair done, then get her nails done
Go to Fifth Ave, just to shop for Chanel, huh
She the one who ain't really got shit, huh
That little bitch that really ain't got tits, huh
The fucking slut with her chest enhanced
Titty dances to pay for her breasts implants, huh

[Eminem]
Anybody with knives, we got knives too
More sharper and ready to outslice you
About five dudes deep, who out-size you
And wanna see insides coming outside you
Get me drunk and I'll drink anything you can think
What's up Ms. Bitch
Yo, what's up with the ring, you married
Shit, I'm still mingling, bitch
I just wanted this ring, this the only finger it fit
Wattup with you, you married
Naw, I'm divorced
Of course you are, you little fucking trailer park whore
Trailer, I don't live in no trailer
I live in a mobilization unit, for your information
Bitch, I got a dick, wanna fuck
Hold still, swallow this birth control pill, slut
Before I pump so much cum in your stomach that when I pull out
A year-and-a-half old, potty-trained baby falls out
And I ain't staying to pay no child support, are you playing
Be a man
Bitch what you saying
You tryin to pull some bullshit
While I got one arm free
You want me to make this half-nelson a full

[Refrain]

[Royce]
What's up boo, this is for you and your girlfriend
You Bankhead, up in Detroit we Earl Flynn
Assholes get guns and flashed those
Never ever go to Detroit, we blast those
Hi, my name is

Gimme money, gimme jewels, everything
Ayo, you with the long hair, is it yours
I guess so, got a reciept paid for
Got anymore lipstick

Get a perm, you nappy head, you chicken head
I know you ghetto, I ain't trying to take the ghetto out
Things about you to tell about, mellow out
I'm the one that be making the clubs say what
Getting love, and making the club say what
Some of you cats hate on the low and got sick
Any songs that's not hits, it's not this

[Refrain]



[Eminem]
Slim Shady
Asshole

[Royce]
Any nigga wit guns, we got guns too
More heated, ready to outgun you
It's too late I already outdone you
You was around, then you know the outcome too
Let's play, lemme show you what Game is
Heartbreak, I'm showin' you what pain is
Please, I'm reppin' the D homeboy
Where your guns, you steppin' to me homeboy
Royce five-nine's the name, niggas know
And niggas know, dealin' wit me? Niggas no
Ayyo toots, how you get here, you wanna ride

Psych, I ain't got no five, you gold-digger
You wanna suga-daddy, go get you an old nigga

Can't get none, but you know I love you girl
Yo

Fuckin slut with a chest enhanced
Titty dances to pay for her breast implants

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/eminem/eminem-is-back/shes-the-one.html]

(Trailer? I don't live in no trailer

[Intro: Rondell Beene, (Eminem)]
Bitch (Yeah)

[Chorus 1]
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
That's right motherfuckers we back
Same slanging, orangatanging, wilding out on hoodrats
They say I act like I'm too famous to say hi
And tell 'em what my name is but really I'm still nameless
You niggas don't get it yet, do you
Deal or not, platinum or flop I still put it through you
With a Luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal wit you in front of St. Andrew's still?
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that roll you got
You gon' see these Runyan Ave. niggas that really need some Prozac
Fo' sho' that, ask the others, Brigade'll lay you down
Next to your mother's mother's grandmother

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight and half the niggas I give dap to I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it like the next L.A. Clippers' game (bitch)
I kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom (punk)
You and your madame, it's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call theyself screaming about a challenge (what?)
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off mere talent
My skills are deeply embedded even your ho said it (uh-huh)
She was knock kneed I fucked her now she's bow legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic (what?)
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping (bitch)
Kuniv' and Kon Artis, my nigga we get it cracking
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing

[Hook: Kon Artis]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't
Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't
Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]
The feds can't hold me, I hold feds
I was born with a dark ass cloud over my head
Raining acid, you can't refrain from getting yo' ass kicked
Cause you talk too much - you asked for it
I'm on some massive shit, everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas get confronted (whattup now?) then they change stories
I cut you and they thinking everything's hunky dory
I even have you pouring me the gasoline for me
Pulling up slowly, cocktailing your homie
You met a lot of niggas but you wouldn't wanna know me (f'real)
Yo' ass might not even make it home wit your Roley
Don't even try, in your system like e. coli
Trying to beef with me, nigga please yo' people die
I'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally
I survived the abortion immediately, SURPRISE! AAAAAH!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting (Shit!!)
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
So when the cops come knocking each hand's got one
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs
One man army, guns can't harm me
Young and ornery, worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop airing out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flipped at censorship
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I've been giving it 110%
Cause when I vent - most of my energy's spent on enemies
80% of what I invent is Hennessey
20% is from being hungry as sin
10's because I love being under your skin *SHIT!*
Yeah! Shit can happen, so stick to rapping
Quit the yapping or I'mma lift the mac and
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap get the can of whoop-ass cracking!

[Hook]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't
Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't
Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man

[Outro Over Hook: Eminem]
It can and it will (nigga, nigga)
Fuck around with Amityville and you DIE
Insanity spills from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers
In six different bodies with their personalities split
Fucking you up with hit after hit
Sticking you up with clip after clip
Making you suck dick after dick
Dirty motherfucking dozen
The Kon Artis, motherfucking Peter S. Bizarre
Swifty McVay, the Kuniva, Dirty FATHER-fucking Harry
Putting you down in a cemetery, you get buried
All you of you motherfuckers suck our motherfucking cocks!
We are not playing, we are not playing
We are not bullshitting, this is not a motherfucking joke!
All of you motherfuckers get smoked!



[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Yo, let's bring it

[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend their whole life peddlin' drugs
Slangin' dope in hopes of one day bein' able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back 'em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's ass backwards, 'cause them niggas just gon'
Keep comin' back and that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off, I'm laughin' all
The way to the bank, watchin' the satellite from a Bentley
And you niggas don't even got a car, you're so far
Under my radar, I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin', I don't even listen
To your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin'
And media just feeds into these feuds
Tryna add fuel to the fire, this lil' nigga Ja Rule
Talkin' bout he's gon' slap me? Nigga please!
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview him
All they doin' is makin' fake threats to us through them
And, pussy, you not Pac, I knew him
Pac was a real nigga, you're just a fuckin' insult to him
It's too bad we had to fall out before he passed
'Cause if he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin' your ass
You're talkin' to a pioneer who engineered
This shit for 19 years, who you got in ya ear? Pshhhhh!
I ain't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit tryna be tough, nigga, you look like an asshole

[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
They say, "Why don't we increase the peace?"
The only piece increased is that which deletes your peeps
'Cause niggas run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that fo'-five will cease your speech
Yeah, it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached ya peak, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin' to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin' to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin' you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the Doc op- on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets, I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue, give a fuck
If all ten of them with you, I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen, vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
All this bickerin' back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pulled your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
And quit tellin' all these magazines your plans
How you gon' slap up my mans? You're fict-ious
Nigga, we'll send Stan to come murder your bitches

[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yeah
Go hide behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter of fact
Go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody rap wit you
You can't see that?
You fell off, nigga
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Damn
Shady slash Aftermath, mothafucker
2003 to infinity!
Yeah!



[Intro]
Hahaha, yeah yeah, haha
No offense to my two niggas
Y'all know who y'all are, it's personal
Motherfucker, you hear me?
I know I ain't get back to you
You dissed me a while ago, I just caught it
I couldn't understand what yo' fat-ass was sayin!
It's all good though (I will shit on you)
I'm home, it's time for us to talk to each other
Nigga.. (fuck, you)

[Verse]
Yo yo, I heard you on DJ Butter, you ain't slick
Somewhere in between a st-st-stutter and punch diss
I was like, "Huh, what the fuck is this?
Why the fuck this lame nigga tryna fuck with this?"
You was talkin real reckless, you dissed the king
Get your eyes off my necklace, kiss the ring
Crawl 'fore you walk, don't get caught without your gat
Somebody shoulda taught you how to talk before you rap
I know about how you gotta get walked though your verse
Niggas tryna teach you how you talk all through your verse
The streets, magazines still knockin your verse
On your verse, niggas just look at they watch and converse
I'm about realism - as far as a fat nigga
That raps and rapes kids, I don't see the vision
You do front, me you admire
You told the truth once like, "I'm a compulsive liar!"
Insecure niggas take offense to the line
All in my my shit when I'm mentionin mines
Yo it's on, better tell Von stick to the rhymes
You better run and get Swift when I get to the nine
It should be: Wall Street, y'all and Slum V
But no, (nope) you wanna rhyme like Young Zee
Heh, you was a clown in school
Only nigga on stage in a costume, now the world is clownin YOU
The sheriff of the rap - arrestin the big fat bear
That gotta jump into character to rap
Uhh, nigga GIMME this mic, you ain't doin it right
You call yourself a idiot, I'm just provin you right
This is strong over the weak, long career over deceased
And me doin you wrong over your beat
You speak when you see me but you talk the flow
Fuckin clown, smile nigga, honk your nose (honk honk!)
You probably look at it like I'm makin a big deal
But nigga that's what I do, I make big deals
Take a chunk of the budget, and keep they proud raise
And watch the little people split the pie five ways
Nigga go play, matter fact, catch up
I am six figures bigger and my books kept up
Y'all a rap boy band, and you testin me now?
Y'all a group with one star like Destiny's Child
FUCK THAT! No nigga, how can I relate
To a group with four dudes that's easily replaced?
I erase niggas when they talk backwards (what?)
I call Paul and have him write you off on his taxes
I'm a solo artist, you just one of the crew
Fans comin up to y'all like, "Which one is you?"
You the fat one! Tell 'em that's your name
You will tell a joke whenever too, that's your game
Yeah, who cares if you've been on tour, you don't come off
Nigga all you do is run on stage and run off
Yeah, one loose cannon - that's strange
Cause the only cannon in the crew is planted wherever Proof's standin
I speak to Em and Proof, I'm speakin with love
Them my niggas, y'all sissy niggas keepin a grudge
I don't give a FUCK nigga, you get beat up with gloves
And if you want beef, fuck it, you can meet up with Bugz
I'll shit on you!

You fat motherfucker
Aiyyo cut that shit! Fuck that nigga
You diss me you gon' get dissed back, nigga
Yo' mama, muh'fucker
And I beat yo' ass, Wall Street ho



[Intro: Eminem]
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you
I'll shit on you! Girl you know, its true
I'll shit on you! Bitch or man, its true
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I remain fatter than gluttony
Taping bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't wantin me
The national guard, they scared of huntin' me
I love beef; I got you hoes ducking me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs'll keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nuttin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes ending up in a fucking mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screaming
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll shit on you!)
I'll shit on you!

[Hook: Eminem]
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I'm a alcoholic, where's the fucking toilet?
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch, shut your fucking mouth
I'mma keep eating 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chainsaw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fucking with your twelve year old baby sitter (hahaha)
And all women ain't shit - only good for cooking, cleaning
And sucking dick - and that's it! (I said it)
I'm responsible for killing John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My adolescent years weren't shit to what I do now
I never grew up, I was born grown and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me
It's they who legs I break and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so ANGRY!
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants down and

[Hook: Eminem]
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

[Verse 4: Kon Artis]
Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles dangling (oww, oww)
My need I stay strangling, I don't need your help
If you don't give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll shit on you!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your TEC, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
Yo, it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worse than Steve Stoute
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like Deebo fighting Peabo Bryson (I'll shit on you!)
Fuck what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out!
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; (bling bling)
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

[Hook: Eminem]
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Once I get on two hits of X my disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(c'mon, I'll shit on you!) Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zany acting maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by as I start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child (I'll shit on you!)

[Hook: Eminem]
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
I will fuck your wife if you fuck with me
I'll shit on you!

[Outro: Eminem]
You heard me
Bitch, I'll shit on you
D12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you
Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you



[Intro: Chester Bennington "KIISFM 102.7 Interview"]
I know that for me, when I'm in my own head. This place right here, that is a bad neighborhood. This is a bad place for me to be by myself. When I'm in that, my whole life gets thrown off. If I'm in there, I don't say nice things to myself. There's another Chester in there that's like wants to take me down. Being with other people, like being a dad, being a husband, being a bandmate, being a friend, helping someone out… If I'm out of myself, I'm great. If I'm inside all the time, I'm horrible — I'm a mess

[Verse 1: Eminem "Beautiful"]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
(Here today, gone tomorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow)

[Hook: Skylar Grey "Rescue Me"]
So can you rescue me?
Can you rescue me?
Drowning at sea?
So can you rescue me from me?
Can you rescue me

[Hook 2: Chester Bennington "I'LL BE GONE"]
And tell them I couldn't help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing that can stop me
I'll be gone

[Verse 2: Eminem "Beautiful"]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

[Hook: Skylar Grey "Rescue Me"]
Can you rescue me?
Drowning at sea?
So can you rescue me from me?

[Hook 2: Chester Bennington "I'LL BE GONE"]
And tell them I couldn't help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing that can stop me
I'll be gone

#RIPCHESTER



[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away



[Intro]
Yeah, I'm trying to catch me something
A little jux or something

[Chorus]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse 1]
You wanna spray at me? Go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new SIG and that old .38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching dread serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch please
This is stash house, jackpot, there go them keys
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek with marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH!

[Chorus]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse 2]
Who's that peeping in my window?
WOW, the Feds on me now
They know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming fuck Jake
I'm trying to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at AI peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two MACs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name in NY, they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low key

[Chorus]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Let tomorrow have its way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go; Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it—pay back, motherfucker
For the way that you got at me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake…

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Aaah) Ash to Ashes, dust to dust
(Aaah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Will tomorrow have its way
With the promises betrayed?
Skin to bone and steel to rust (x3)



Eminem has become the first rapper to perform a headline show at Wembley Stadium

"I see a lot of people who appear to be fucking wasted – how many people here are fucking wasted? And how many people are here are just fucked up mentally?" calls Eminem, introducing My Name Is, the anthem of every angry adolescent on the planet.

It's met with a feral roar from his army of fans, adorned in a uniform of Parental Advisory T-shirts, foam middle fingers or V For Vendetta masks.

You can see why this crowd of largely febrile young men welcome him back to the stage like an army of internet trolls blessed by the presence of their maker: Eminem is the first rapper to headline Wembley Stadium – and yet by his own admission, he's only here because Hyde Park deemed his lyrical content too offensive.

For music's perennial delinquent – now aged 41 – tonight is the first of two shows at the 90,000 capacity venue, and is the first time the Detroit artist has played the city since 2001 – a set that was then threatened by gay and women's rights protesters before the rapper sparked further controversy with the performance itself, as he took the stage replete with chainsaw, Friday the 13th hockey mask and, perhaps the most cardinal sin of all, wearing nothing but a pair of loosely fitting denim dungarees.
This time, however, the goal is to establish himself as one of music's most iconic artists, rather than shock the masses.

In those 13 years Eminem has encountered all manner of wrinkle inducing incidents – family lawsuits, overdoses and subsequent stints in rehabilitation and now sobriety – but he still cuts a striking figure. His arms are big but his face is thin and remains hidden by a black cap throughout the show, with his bleached blond hair barely visible.
He rattles through the first half of the set as if reacquainting himself with the stage, and it's not until he brings on surprise guest Dr Dre halfway through the show for Next Episode, Still Dre, G Thang and Forgot About Dre, that Eminem's ambitions become fully realised - even if Dre's voice is a much more almighty force than his apprentice's.

Despite his budget stretching to snag the richest rapper of all time, unfortunately there was no sign of Dido for Stan tonight, her part as an ill-fated pregnant girlfriend instead played by a glamorous backing vocalist in a leotard.

Some of Eminem's vision is executed brilliantly – after all, he's been making stadium rap albums since 2002. Tracks like Survival befit its location with its poodle perm guitars, and the Beastie Boys-indebted Berzerk sounds incredible live. Sing for the Moment and Toy Soldiers are huge crowd-pleasers, but then they were always built for arenas – to fill them, maybe, but not necessarily satisfy.

When it works, Eminem's music fills the space with a dark, rumbling magic – The Way I Am and his medley of My Name Is, Real Slim Shady and Without Me hits the balance of huge and yet intimately evil – but the flat points during the show come from a lack of menace, of spite, that same sinisterness that first gained him his loyal tribe, and made him so exciting.

• This article was amended on 12 July to correct a song title from Sing It to Sing for the Moment.



[Verse One: Eminem]
I'm a pacifist, unless there's ass to kick
It'll be tragic miss, If I don't fuck you bitch
You can take the dick you little cunt
Lick it than pass it like a blunt
But I'm sober now I'm done with drugs
That was the last chapter this is the next one
My place in the game is big, son
I'm somewhere between God, Godzilla, and King Kong
A Monster, yeah like his dick is
They say I'm hung like a bear, so run, run bitches
The chainsaw can give you staple stitches
If your unfaithful, just kill your wife than rape your mistress
And if that don't work your a fucking retard
I'm sick of playing games, I'm here for revenge, Dee Barnes
Slapping up Dre for what he start-
Ed, long time ago and it left him scarred

[Hook: Eminem] x2
Everybody knows I'm crazy
This game isn't gonna change me
There's nothing else to say, see
You already know I'm Shady

[Verse Two: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
I'm assuming you don't want to battle
That will be your dying day
Into your house bullets will rattle
You just cannot win this fray
Don't believe me ask Ray (Cornrows)
(I heard he thinks he's gangsta), but he's really not though
(so don't fuck with Slim), that's the goal
(he'll burn your house down), and relocate you to the motorhomes
Holdin' pullin' moldin' chrome
Oldest, dopest, grossest flow
Killer, father, loving home
Family jealous of all this gold
Everybody wants a million from Shady
Even the goddamn motherfuckers who hate me
But I stays crazy, and sprayz AKs at babys
Me and Drezy (Yeah Slim your Shady)

[Hook 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)] x2
Mothefucker I told you I was (crazy)
The game done helped (shape me)
The only thing left to (say b)
Is hey (Slim your Shady)


[Outro: Eminem]
Relapse 2 mothafuckas
Fuck you and your mothas
Dre grab the gat *gunshots*



[Skit: Slim Shady, Eminem]

"Eminem..."
"No..."
"Eminem!"
"No..."
"Hahaha. Wake the fuck up, motherfucker."
"What do you want from me?!"
"Hahahaha. Remember me?"
"I killed you!"
"You thought I was dead, didn't you?"
"What do you want from me?!"
"I'm alive..."
"Oh, God..."
"Get up."
"No."
"Get up and look in the mirror."
"I don't want to!"
"Look in the mirror, it's just a reflection. Haha"
"Leave me alone!!!"
"Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me! Look in the motherfucking mirror!"
"Leave me alone!!! Leave me the fuck alone!!!"
[Eminem punches the mirror, breaking it.]

[Low, Down, Dirty being scratched.]



[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who, New shit!
D12 World, D-Twizzy!

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas (Swift)
And slow your roll

[Verse 1: Swift]
Sinister, a menace to many, I'm not friendly
You get shot in a Kennedy fashion
Pop willingly you walking around with Pac's identity
I'm a mockery you 'bout to watch what it's fin to be
I'm not mentally focused but lyrically we got it locked
And it's not about dropping albums, I'll sock a nigga on the spot
You can't help it but to imagine this walking massacre
A madman strapped with a Magnum blow that spasm out ya back
And just stand there and snatch your medallion
See I can't fear any nigga that can not happen
The immaculate Mac handler
That got this wrapping by the back of his neck
A scavenger I'm a threat then you feel me
Like a hand full of syringes
I'm ill enough to scream at your front do'
Blow it off the hinges (nigga)
I'm marksmatic, depressed marksman outta walking
'Cause soon your body they catch me shooting up your carcass
So don't provoke shit, I wish the whole
Mankind was a neck so I can choke it
Ferocious and you ain't gonna be knowing where ya folks is
Fuck the milk cartons and posters, it's over, they ghosts (hey)

[Verse 2: Proof]
Niggas is bitch instead of digging a ditch
I'ma see how filled this river can get even bitches get hit
I'm raw dog on all fours, I'm barking with long claws
Just fight for the wrong cause
Your boss with thong drawers (oh no)
You ain't in my bracket bitch, following faggots
With wanksta tats on their ass, see ya
[Eminem backwards:] Magic Stick If I get hit once you get hit twice
These scrubs need to do what he love and just play the back
Before I'll put a sword on ya head like a Raider cap
You bust I'm spraying back, leave your hood laying flat
Now what you gonna say to that?

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas (Bizarre)
And slow your roll

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Pull up new county truck, throw up, blow up, beat a handicap bitch up
Fuck butter I killed the DJ
I don't need you, bitch, I got a instant replay
Lay down bitch get butt naked
And fuck the Viagra I'm trying to nut in two seconds
All around the world, fuck wit' different cliques
You ain't got no weed get the fuck out my room bitch

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I'm calm but I steal on niggas like I was klepto
Put that chrome shit to ya head like you was Destro
Why stop niggas, why not pop niggas, we cop figures
Keep them toast like IHOP nigga, we breathe dirt so be alert
Or get them guns on ya chest like a welcome to the hood T-shirt
Let's go back before throw backs, before I dro sacks
I used to blow gats, bullets'll find you like a low jack
I'm hopeless, a ferocious dosage of dope shit
A culprit of culture and a chaotic commotion
Kuniva will blow shit off of the map and post it
Knock you out of your penny loafers, fuck that ho shit

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas
And slow your roll

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
I point my fingers to the ground, throw my waist to left of me
To knuckle should ship like a Em upside down and you best be
On your p's and q's people we sees to use
No one see's your views, so now you see's exclusives
And put it in your little magazine, but you should
Know that was the most desperate thing that you could
Pull out of your crotch you faggots all owe us much
Start doing heroin lines for as much as you gossip
Like bitches with Oscars, y'all actresses
45's make bodies flip like flabby tits
Bullets coming at your doom like a buck up 6th
Now what the fuck you gonna do to get up out of this shit?
Your record was released 17 years ago you dumb bitch
Do the math, you'll never have a Shady/Aftermath Runyon Ave
Kind of staff to back that ass up so back that ass up
Before we clap that ass up

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas
And slow your roll

[Outro: Kon Artis]
Nigga you better ask somebody
These niggas think they can just put shit
Out on their own, fuck them



[Eminem & Brenda]
(Yo) Brenda (Brenda's not here)
Brenda's not there? (No) It sounds like you?
You know what? You didn't think I knew, did you?
(I, you know-) You told me you didn't do this shit
This Brenda, right? Don't play games with me, girl!
This Brenda, right? You said you didn't do it, bitch!
(Who are you, what you want?) What are you- I want Bren-
This ain't Brenda? (No, motherfucker, it ain't Brenda)
Yo, don't-don't-don't call me a motherfucker, bitch
I swear to God, I come up there and pop all you fucking sluts
I told you Brenda, don't be fuckin' round on me
You fuckin' bitch! I told you!
"Aw, I don't do it, I don't do it!"
You motherfucking slut, I'll kill you, bitch!
I break your motherfucking neck
(You getting mad at me, I'm not Brenda)
Yo, don't play games with me, girl!
Don't play ga- When you come home tonight
I swear to God, yo, all of your shit will be outside!
You hear me girl?! I ain't playing with you no more!
I bought you everythi- "I saw yoooou, walking in the way"
You know what I'm saying, girl?!
I don't play that shit! (Crack kills, you know)
I don't play that shit, crack?! (Crack kills)

You understand me?

Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?

And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me

Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor

Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club and wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're —"
I'm like, "Yeah, I know, let's cut to the chase"
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'

Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Smack that!

Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Shorty, if you wanna ride, you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef? Damn right, can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Lookin' all oiled-up and all greasy
'Bout that time you stop that teasin'
Way that you drop done got me here cheesin'
What's funny is that you takin' all my money for real
I'd rather spend it on you right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made fo'
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid fo'
Won't move 'til you on my payroll

[Pre-Hook: Akon]
I feel you creepin'
I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me

[Hook: Akon]
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
(Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo! Ahhh!)

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
I love when you do it
Girl, move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down, I want to put my thing through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper, slide down my pole
Shorty ass so swole, got your boy like, "Whoa!"
One night with me, now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like, "No, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole."
Make you lose control and all her girls know
That I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
If she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine; Stat Quo, yeah!

[Pre-Hook: Akon]
I feel you creepin'
I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me

[Hook: Akon]
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
(Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know what I'm sayin'?)

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her, so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave, I can see right through her
So we dipped out, burn one, trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl, get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body eight-like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king 'cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care—listen, baby, it's a fact that
If you drop back I'ma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at?

[Pre-Hook: Akon]
I feel you creepin'
I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me

[Hook: Akon]
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh



[Akon:] Konvict
[Eminem:] Shady
[Akon:] Konvict Muzik
[Eminem:] Guess who's back?
[Obie Trice:] Still here, haters
[Akon:] Akon and Obie Trice, yeah
[Obie Trice:] Whatcha gonna do it with it, A?
Whatcha gonna do?
[Akon:] Take 'em all back to the streets

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need
Believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit
Pray I don't face you, yeah

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
It's risky, the bitch tend to rise out a nigga
It's history, snitch, who decided he's a member?
Once he got pinched, coincided with law
Same homie say he lay it down for the bul
Brought game squad around ours
How could it be? Been homies since Superman drawers
Only phoniness never came to par
He had us, a true neighborhood actor
Had his back with K's, now we see through him like X-Ray's
Cuffed in that Adam car
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war
Knowin' not to cross those Reservoir Dogs
You helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable?
When we invest in team, it's to the death for sho'
No X and O's; TEC's, Calico's aimed at your chest, nigga

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need
Believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit
Pray I don't face you, yeah

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We started out as a crew, when one speak it's all honest
Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's
Reconnaissance when we peep enemies on us
Been on these corners, sellin' like anything on us
Knowin' Heaven has shown us bein' devil's minors
But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China
We gon' keep the grind up 'til death come find us
Meantime leanin' in them European whips reclined up
It's eye for an eye for the riders
We ain't tryin' to get locked up, we sole survivors
Po-po's is cowards, it's no you, it's ours
We vowed this, mixin' yayo with soda powder
Who woulda known he would fold and cower?
Once the captain showed he sold to Old McDonald
So it's no X and O's; TEC's, Calico's aimed at your chest, nigga

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need
Believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit
Pray I don't face you, yeah

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Nowadays, Sammy Da Bull's got the game fooled
So he move to a rural area to keep cool
They snitchin' on a snitch now, it's nothin' to tell
Nowadays your circle should be small as hell
Ain't tryin' to meet new faces, this don't interest me
Even if we bubble slow we'll get it eventually
No penitentiary, there'll be no clemency
You will meet the Lord, snitch, in givin' us a century
These cats is rats now, the streets need decon
That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on 'em
Stop snitchin', you asked for the life you're livin'
This act is not permitted nowhere on the map
It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison
If you been in it along with 'em, then snitch and become hidden
So it's no X and O's; TEC's, Calico's aimed at your chest, nigga

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need
Believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit
Pray I don't face you, yeah

[Outro: Obie Trice]
You rat bastard!



[Roger & Skylar]
Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me, Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica
Wait a minute, you hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other
Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together
I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No, Roger, that's not what I want to do
I love her, and we're gonna be together
Never



[Intro]
Yeah, haha, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too, damn
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
You see, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?

[Verse 1]
I’m the American Dream
I’m the definiton of white trash ballin’
I’m right back on 'em with a *err-chick-err, chicka-chick*
I can’t call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can’t wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin’? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady’s origin
You’ll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must’ve got my pimpin' genes from him
The way he left my momma
I’m a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I’ll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as
Me, I’m as calm as the breeze
I’m the bee’s knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl, I’m ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Verse 2]
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First I’ll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate
This ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April
I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shakin' so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, you’re the bomb, baby
Oh, you’re doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I’m Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax, woman, you know that I’m only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think you’re finally startin' to get the picture, I’m just...

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
‘Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Verse 3]
I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if I’m what you wanted
Why’d you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I’m just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can’t ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let’s get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
‘Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying "Don't Disturb"
Shawty, I’m so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
‘Cause I am on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Lightyears ahead of you



[Intro]
I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

[Verse 1]
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john, I get maddened
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened
To run out of tissue, yeah, hand me that
On second thought I'd be glad then
"Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan."
I wiped my ass with it
Crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him: "Todd, you're the shit," when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causing an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
But the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass!
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past—iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm as stubborn as

[Chorus]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)

[Verse 2]
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag—teenagers act more fuckin' mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I leave on my own terms, asshole
I'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with
PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti
Put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's, and belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day, someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King—they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catchin' up with me

[Chorus]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)

[Bridge]
Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So, I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

[Verse 3]
I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger, buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
"Wow! Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
I'm in the crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught picking my nose (agh!)
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
Play it off, "What you bumpin'?"
"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better," fuckin' bitch!
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with
Another one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limit—what a pity!
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse—I'm livin' the dream!

[Chorus]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)



[Intro]
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealing
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealing
Willing to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissing you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fucking judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whip a motherfucking bouncer, 6'2"
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pouring salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Outro]
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left

(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT!
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT!

[50 Cent]
It's a fact homie, eagles don't fly in flocks
But the eagles I got hold sixteen shots
Like beefin', homie I ain't sayin' a word
I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the clutch, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told them you respect me, now tell them I'm the nicest
Admit it nigga, I'm a mid-life crisis

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (I got the rep of a villian, the weapon concealin')
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (full of controversy until I retire my jersey)

[Lloyd Banks]
It's like niggas rate the respect of who gat bigger
Banks been blowin' on purple stuff before that fat nigga
Pennies make dollars, and dollars make death threats
I'm doin' remixes to bulletproof the Lex next
Duck nigga, everyday's war
I'm heavy on sports, so my drawer's like the NBA store
Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' em down
We're in the pound puttin' fear in the clown
I'm running with gangstas, don't make one of em shank ya

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (I got the rep of a villian, the weapon concealin')
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (full of controversy until I retire my jersey)

[Tony Yayo]
I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back



[Intro: 2Pac]
So what I'm gonna do, hopefully, is
I wanna be… I'm, I, I'm not a "wanna be"
I am 2Pac Shakur

2Pac 2005!

{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}
{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}
{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}
{Vocal scratch: "Guess who's back!"}

[Refrain: 2Pac]
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me
I ain't bust, but now I'm touchy, trust me
Ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buckshots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem
Now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' soldier, ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' ‘cause there's no stoppin' till they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped — I'm a soulja!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I bet you that I got something you ain't got
That's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
2Pac and the Mad Bitch
In the six-fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the back seat, nigga, when we clown
Homie, is you down? Dee got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fore she spank shit
Comin' round the corner spittin' rounds
They can't hold me down
Caught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgement day
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day—stinkin' beyotch!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I bet you that I got somethin' you ain't got
That's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't

[Refrain: 2Pac]
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me



[Styles P]
Yo Poobs! Ghost..
Poobs turn me up my nigga
Time is money, Double R
D-Block, shit's real

Nigga it's the Ghost off the M.B
I breathe off of liquor and weed and choose to be when the men sleep
I don't even pray with my eyes closed
Soulless screamin I know the demons, hide where the lies go
Try to fall back, off the lyrics with mysticism
Can't express myself, wild out and get shipped to prison
Got a lot of shit I could say
But it's kinda Ludacris that make niggas get out the way
Kinda selfish if I make niggas get out and spray
Leave you helpless and the only thing you do is you pray, nigga
Shit is God-made, or man-made and machine-made
I don't want beef I want money, that's the green way
The pride overpower the brain
I won't die like a coward, muh'fucker I'm vain
I'm a gangsta in the car in the dirt and the chains
I've been hurt and in pain, and stood tall in this urban terrain
But a man must admit to his faults, I know mine
I'm the type that always wanna revolt (yeah)
If I can't kill a nigga then I want an assault (yeah)
Shit hard, just listen to the bars shit's makin ya {?}
Some niggas shiver and listen, no lie
Close your eyes it's the bigger division
Life or death nowadays is a nigga's decision, here's your jewels
When you make yours, just make sure you make it on the move
Nigga

Yeah, Ghost, time is money
Shit's not a game
I ain't fuckin around
Yo Poobs we out {Mario?}



Kick a hypest lyric every time I run upon a track
You know I'm not wack
You have to step back
'Cause if you don't I'll prove that I'm the mac
Every time I kick a lyric tune it to two-ninety-five
Yo do you find me live?
If you don't then that's all right 'cause I'll just grab the microphone
And I just got to get so hype when I speak in a hyper tone
There's so many styles I might get thrown
And here's a place where I like to roam
And all the girls that I like to bone
Have the big butts, no they don't 'cause I don't like that nigga shit
I'm just here to make a bigger hit
When I be kickin' the hypest dopest rhymes
Just say that Eminem is the best MC in of all times



[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Wake up this morning I'm shaking I can't be still girl
Too many images running through my mind
Soon as I hit it, I can't get it out my system
Even my brother he asked me what you on

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy (Tay-K47)]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room
(Free Santana Bitch!)

[Verse 2: Tay-K47]
Mama told me; "Never lose, cause baby you a winner"
I was lurking 'round his block, he was lurking on my twitter
At the trap with the Glocks nigga, Tay-K babysitter
I was just trying to shine like some muh'fuckin' glitter
I was under rugs with my cuz tryna rob a plug
Little bitch hit me up she want love
I ain't show enough
I said "Bitch I'm a rugrat, I don't know how to love back"
Groupies and them dub sacks, girl that's where my love at

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
We ain't playin anymore
Privacy on the door
(Privacy on the door)
We ain't playin anymore
Privacy on the door
When we finish baby
Ain't gon' need no more



[Verse: Eminem]
Fab, I'ma kill you
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh



[Intro]
You fuckin' groupie!
Pick up the goddamn phone!

[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You wanna loose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?", well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—oohm, touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace, but you ain't
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late; go smurf yourself!
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over
But they let me go, 'cause I told 'em I'm only drivin' drunk
'Cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'Cause a woman broke my he-art
I say he-art 'cause she ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage; who do you think you a-are?
Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo… Lesbian! Aaahhh!
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life'd be so much better if you just—

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Bridge]
'Cause you told me
You'd love me forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never wanted someone
To die so bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea

[Verse 3]
And I'ma have a whale of a time, bein' a single sailor
For the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, ho, I got an Oscar
Attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-
Made for me, say fuck it
Kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin'
To latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head (you made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? (bitch)
I would feel so much, much better

[Outro]
I'm just playin', bitch
You know I love you



[Verse 1: M&M]
[?]
[?] pain in the wrist
Slaughterhouse [?] like a parade in the pit
Boom!

[Hook: Chaos Kid & M&M]
What's your intent?
I'm analyzing every cut your in to judge your intent
I wanna know where you stand, I mean, as far as who you are
How would you act if you woke up and tomorrow you're a star?

[Verse 2: M&M]
I made a new team that can help me do a little dough
[?]

[Hook]

[Interlude]
What's your intent?
Gimme a hand (Move 'em!)
Baby what's your intent?
All of y'all, come on, put 'em up! put 'em up!
What's your intent?

[Verse 3: M&M]
[?]"The rapper that's real is the one that stuck to his roots
Because they got ahold of him so much they stuck to his boots
And the only way to tell if he's really real is wait until he's made a mil
And then you ask him if he still, and if he's real then still he will."

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you



[Verse 1]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust

[Verse: Eminem]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how? Everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up, over
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rapshody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't-

[Outro]
Value, variety, convience and control
Haha, it's definitely time to play tv



Twisty808 - Spaz ft Eminem

[Chorus: Twisty] (2x)
All we wanna do is spaz.. spaz.. spaz
The industry we'll smash
Till it crash.. crash.. crash

[Verse: Twisty]
Twisty on the track
Range spaztic
Shorty rollin hard
Straight aztec
Geared up
With the spears up
Clashin
Cross the line
Toss thy hide
On the Canvas
Smashin competition
Unmatched man
No remorse for the cats
We catch nappin
Rattle off on the boss
I damage
Tattle off
Leave you lost
In a trash bag
Underground we rep
No hashtag
Industry catch strep
When we blast em
Savages reek havoc laughin
Catch a breath for a sec
Don't panic
Blackballed
So the trap calls
Crossed off
Like a scratch card
Speedin
To the crash course
We street
While you half fourths
I believe I put em under seige
Wolverine I berserk a beat
Bathory
When I make em bleed
Shang Tsung
When they soul retreat
I'm the ghost
When they say retreat
No more coastin
I will kill the peak
Rollin foes like I'm Tecca neen
Seal they casket let them scream defeat

[Chorus: Twisty] (2x)
All we wanna do is spaz.. spaz.. spaz
The industry we'll smash
Till it crash.. crash.. crash

[Verse: Eminem]
Once I get on two hits of X
My disc slips and disconnects
Till I walk around this bitch
With a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch
Who disrespects (I shit on you)
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zany acting maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by as I start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so ANGRY!
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy

[Chorus: Twisty] (4x)
All we wanna do is spaz.. spaz.. spaz
The industry we'll smash
Till it crash.. crash.. crash



[Produced by Seven]

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I get to bustin' like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him purty hot
'Cause he knowin' that Tecca Nina's a dirty chopper
He’s handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though?
I said to Seven, "Richie Havens'll be the man," so
We put it together thinkin' Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, 'cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, "What we doin'?" – I said to him, "Let's chop!"
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another chopper's comin' so let's rock, nigga!
You're on, people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer makin' a tour strong
If you thinkin' of battlin'—you're gone!

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Nobody can catch him, he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if you got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em, and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I’ve got to audibly body them
This is it, man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain’t ever been a gift for me to heat 'em
I beat 'em, I burn 'em (Then I let 'em melt)
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton, making ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I’m livin' in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast, or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half-ass deliverin' I'ma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around, so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master, meaning we murderize
We'll bleed 'em, beat 'em 'til they be gone, feed 'em!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Wait! 'Fore I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills
Of ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled
Or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink (You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in Vics
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after tonight
I’m grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it’s like, and attackin' it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pent-up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver
Screwed up my limo, collided with the center divider
I went through the window
And ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
'Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You've been yellin' dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate, I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious
Of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity that I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
To make 'em picket, I pick a day to be a prick
Then I'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level, incredible
Head full of Red Bull, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away? Uh-uh, not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake, eatin' lobster, steak
And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take, like Kanye walkin' up on the stage
For Beyoncé, like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher
With his gun insured, hundred words
In a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the—

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you trippin' to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's havin' to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we givin' the light, a lot of energy
We reppin', beat checkin' he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Running you down, in front of your town
You ever makin' fun of the clown, I'm gunnin' you down
We doin' it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch!
Would never be choppin' without Slick Rick
I got it from the record "Lick the Balls" and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, 'cause every time I be droppin' I get bit
I'm hearin' a lot of rappers, they tryin' to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em and we kill 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista rule it—and this it

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say (say)
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never would've thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold?
But bitches, they gon' talk; niggas, they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and—

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart, but when someone seems
Too good to be true, they usually are, but see
When you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is "Fuck a bitch!" (Fuck a bitch!)
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch (Fuck a bitch!)
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this (Because of this)
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit (Other shit)
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss (Should've fed you piss)
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: "Do I love these hoes?" — Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: "50, this is Tanya. Tanya, this is 50."
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips."
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist, too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine



[Intro - Proof]
Hah! This is DJ Seven Duece
Fresh up out your momma's mouth
So when she spit's you know how I "cum"
You know what I mean, haha
We release the Dogg Hour
Where we give a shout out to my School Craft Playaz
Detroit's in the house, live at Roll-in-Wills
Obie Trice baby, check it out...

[Verse - Obie Trice]
I done did my share of dirt, flipped my share at work
I'm the nigga that lived and slid through terror turf
Did it big with clever workers who hid the crack
In the back bottled up in that Gerber glass
For what it's worth, I ain't told to have
I'm just rambling, y'all dick handling
Telling my past and you don't know me
Niggas the name's Obie, I'm bout to expose these motherfuckas

[Hook - Kon Artis]
When I was down you had a lot to say
You should mind your business and walk away
Talk about them trying to find a way
To spread yo shit 'round town
I ain't really got time for you
With all that ignorant shit you do
Niggas need money and I do too
That's why I ain't fucking with you

[Verse - Obie Trice]
I wonder would he pass for a passive
If a massive ass kick's inflicted
It can happen that quick, when spitting shit
Rapidly laying down your fag ass click
From running your lips undefined like a bitch
All I know is something it gotta give
Niggas I gotta live, it's not a prerogative
Don't speak on The Kid
Lid your speech or rid ya in the streets
It's so optional, but I will be logical
Cause when I lodge at you, it's not hospital
Operating poppin' them hot slugs outta your abdominal
Now your momma got a funeral attending
Just for mentioning Obie Trice the Henchmen
All I wanna do is make music and "bench" man
"Get my weight up" the same shit that Jay said
If you hate up, the AK's is sprayin
Motherfuckers ain't playin!

[Hook]
When I was down you had a lot to say
You should mind your business and walk away
Talk about them trying to find a way
To spread yo shit 'round town
I ain't really got time for you
With all that ignorant shit you do
Niggas need money and I do too
That's why I ain't fucking with you

[Verse - Obie Trice]
That's why I don't fuck with you cats
Cause this all wrap with y'all
But this is not an act at all
Run ya trap, get clapped and fall
Spread rumors recieve malignant tumors
Don't confuse music with us choosin
Adhesive patches won't cover the bruise
Channel Two anchors won't cover the news
They never give a fuck when it's beef between crews
All I know is Obie paid his dues
Made his moves and bitch niggas hate the truth
They rather see me laid in that body booth
Deep six, rotten so the rats undefined can chew
That's why I don't fuck with y'all
You'll run and get y'alls, and that really sucks for y'all
Talk behind backs but never to him dawg
Wouldn't that irritate your boss?!

[Hook - repeat 2x]
When I was down you had a lot to say
You should mind your business and walk away
Talk about them trying to find a way
To spread yo shit 'round town
I ain't really got time for you
With all that ignorant shit you do
Niggas need money and I do too
That's why I ain't fucking with you

[Outro - Obie Trice]
Fuckers, Obie Trice

[Intro]
People, it feels so good to be back!
Ladies and gentleman
Introducing the new and improved you-know-who

[Verse 1]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim, nooo!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From séance to séance, aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back (Boo!)
The boogie monster of Rap, yeah, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation of kids
To stand and fight for the right
To say somethin' you might not like
This white hot light that I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there (Haha!)
Yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band-camp thinking that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say "Hussein," you say "Shady"
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 3]
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me—stab me, shoot at me! (Woohoo!)
Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm 'Pac, on my enemies!
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny: I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass-fucking!

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Outro]
Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Cani-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Canada-bis don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you
Yeeehawww!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.: We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it; I hope your conscience eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit's just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you, damn



[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not've got 'em

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, f— it, what's been up, man?

My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some [bitch] who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day
But I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground stuff that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the stuff you did with Rawkus too, that [shit] was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Hook: Elton John]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote
I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's messed up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you
For four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty crummy, man, you're like his favorite idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way; I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a crumby day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got [shit] else
So that [shit] helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real
And I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous ‘cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too

[Hook: Elton John]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins
"In the Air of the Night," about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is
You could've rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we could've been together
Think about it! You ruined it now
I hope you go to sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it; I hope your conscience eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, [bitch!] I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
And then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shoot, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this tape out?!

[Hook: Elton John]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now—how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that [shit] intentionally just to diss you
But what's this stuff you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that stuff just clownin'
Dawg, come on, how messed up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this junk about us meant to be together?
That type of crap'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you
But Stan, why are you so mad?
Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy [shit]
I seen this one [shit] on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was… it was you, damn



In a recent sit-down with MTV News’ Tim Kash, 50 laughed off recent rumors that Em — who has all but disappeared from the public eye in recent years — has been packing on the pounds, and that as a result of his weight gain, has become a recluse, venturing out of his Detroit-area mansion only to gorge himself on meals from Taco Bell and Outback Steakhouse. The G-Unit captain insisted that fans are going to be seeing a slim-and-trim Eminem real soon.

“Em is in shape right now. He looks good. I seen him in Detroit. He’s gonna look real good when you see him return,” Fif laughed. “He’s in shape right now.”

The rapper has been on hiatus ever since releasing his official Shady Records mixtape, Eminem Presents the Re-Up, in December of 2006. In mid-2007, he called in to Angie Martinez’s show on New York radio station Hot 97 to say he was “in limbo” and “debating” whether to release another album . Then, in January of this year, news broke that he had been rushed to a Detroit-area hospital for complications related to pneumonia , and in at least one of those reports, sources were quoted as saying his weight had exceeded 200 lbs.

Those rumors — coupled with a National Enquirer story that quoted an “insider” as saying that the rapper “[has] got a double chin, a potbelly and droopy man-breasts. And he’s living a reclusive lifestyle in an attempt to hide his new body” — had fans worried about Eminem. But 50, who in recent weeks has battled rumors about his own weight thanks to online photos that show him looking extra gaunt, said that those worries are unfounded. According to him, Em’s fine and in fighting shape (or at least, balling shape).

“The last time I seen him we played basketball together,” 50 said. “He had a knee injury, so we chilled for a little bit.”



[Intro]
Yo, yo, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold
Oh so cold, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

[Verse 1]
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park, and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda, and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you might've
Heard of me before, see whore
You're the kind of girl that I'd a–ssault and rape
Then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella
Then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild
But I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah
Now let's see her have triplets, and I'll di–sintegrate them babies
As soon as they're out her with formalde–hyde and cyanide
Girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
Murderin', I'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uhh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull
My knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

[Verse 2]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's making me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
"Who's waking me so violently, and why's he on top of me?"
"He's raping me," she tries to scream
"Somebody please get him off me
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
She's scraping me, she's fighting me
She's scratching like some dumb freak
Escaping me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing
To quite a different drum beat

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

[Verse 3]
Better try to stay wide awake
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep
Bitch, your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away
Why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much
Might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach
Growling from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler
Bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya
With piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, biddy-bye-bye
Biddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand
There's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt?
There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hacking 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's coming in from the back

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake



[Intro]
Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot…

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 2]
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, "Rockstar" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 3]
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones



[Verse 1]
Eat 'em
Every time I come back, I’m putting the mask on my head
Beat the sons of a bitches so hard that they forget where they’re at
I ain’t saying the same thing every time I attack
Damn, I just got whooped by a new jack
A new jack, may be new, let me jack this
[Design?] a few [?] the fact
Of an experience lack
I just ignore 'em
Take my energy and store it
Who want decided to get brave
Then I pour it, pour it
On his ass
Like milk over a wilted plant
Constantly tromping in and around
To get paid again
I drink beer
So, you better steer clear
’Cause I steer and smear
The [grip?] who interferes
Ripping a bastard up in less than a minute
Let’s get hunked by a truck
Suck a straw with answers in it
Suckers are dropping in the back that I stood
I can rhyme while I’m puking and it would still sound good
Even when out of gas
I’m pulling rhymes from my ass
You won't be think as fast enough to talk through the glass
Rain rhymes, you performed a song that you regret
While my money is due, so I can let through the exit
And let's get hangin' at [zen?]
Part of me’s so bad
’Cause I prefer to leave a blur
When I stirred your ass

[Outro]
Runyon Ave, stepping up on to the scene
Chaos Kid, stepping up on to the scene
Manix, stepping up on to the scene
Buttafingaz, stepping up on to the scene
Vitamin C, stepping up on to the scene
Delirious D, stepping up on to the scene
Checkmate, stepping up on to the scene
Reese The Piece, stepping up on to the scene



[Verse 1]
Step right up, I'm about to light up the skyline
So bright, I'mma fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks and go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of Christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross but listen close, if you don't
You can go stick your whole frickin' nose against his crack
'til he lets one go and blows your whiskers back
And get a great big old whiff cause if you last without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of Fear Factor, yeah, I'm back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt, Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? I got a blunt and some Jesus juice
Who needs an excuse these days
The way they rally around pedophiles, you lucky I don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later as long
As it ain't a racist tape from '88, than I'm straight of that cannot be forgave
If I drank pee for, 18 years straight and ate shit every day
On a porcelain plate that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak, knife
For the rest of my life and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by Vanilla Ice
Twice a day, cause I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager
Blaow-blaow, Shade uh 45, shorty, let me get your number, baby
Maybe I can hump your leg or something?
But it's time for me to go, so I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that boob, right?



Eminem: Heyyy
Steve Berman: Hey, Em, what's up
Eminem: Steve Berman, what's going on, man? How you doin'? Good to see you again. What's up?
Steve Berman: Em, could you come here and have a seat, please?
Eminem: Umm, yeah, what's u...
Steve Berman: Vanessa, shut the door
Secretary: Okay
Eminem: So what's up, how's orders lookin' for the first week?
Steve Berman: It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
Eminem: Wh-
Steve Berman: This album is less than nothing
I can't sell this fucking record
Eminem: Wha...
Steve Berman: Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Eminem: Wh-wha-what's the problem?
Steve Berman: Violet Brown told me to go fuck myself!
Eminem: Who's Violet...
Steve Berman: Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
Eminem: But I...
Steve Berman: I'm gonna lose my fucking job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rapping about big-screen TV's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rapping about homosexuals and Vicodin
Eminem: I mean...
Steve Berman: I can't sell this shit!
Eminem: What...
Steve Berman: Either change the record or it's not coming out!
Eminem: What I-
Steve Berman: Now get the fuck out of my office!
Eminem: What am I supposed...
Steve Berman: NOW!
Eminem: Alright man, (whatever)



[Skit: Eminem, Steve Berman]

"This motherfucker, man..."
[Eminem knocks the door.]
[Eminem sighs and the door opens.]

["Ain't Nuttin' But Music" by D12 plays in the background.]

"It's ridiculous, I can't believe it!—Oh, hold on a minute. Em..."
"What up?"
"Have a seat. Dre, I'll call you back."
[Steve hangs up the phone.]
"What now?"
"I don't even know where to start..."
"Okay...?"
"I got the album from upstairs..."
"And..."
"And this, is by far, the most..."
[Eminem cocks a gun and shoots at Steve.]
"...incredible thing... I've ever... heard..."



[Receptionist]
Mr. Berman?

[Steve Berman]
What?

[Receptionist]
We have Eminem here to see you

[Steve Berman & Eminem]
About fuckin' time! Send him in
Steve! Good to see ya, man. Um, hey, I just w–
Well, look who decided to show his face!
I hope you've had fun in the last four years
Look man, I apologize again for–
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
Again, it was a mistake, a terrible mist–
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
And then you go and do what? Hide out?
Stay in Detroit for almost five years
While the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs
Because of your fuckin' vacation?
Well, that's actually why I'm here
I was gonna put out some new music
And I wanted to play it for you and get your opinion
Do I really need to hear it?
Let me guess, another album about: "Poor me!
I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life
And I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it
And my tragic love life!" Am I on to something here?
Come on, man, it's not like that
You know what? Just hand the fuckin' thing over!
I'm done talkin to you!
Think you can just come and go as you please
Big selfish superstar?
Steve, I had a drug problem!
"Oh, poor me! I had a drug problem!"
Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town?
You know what? (*gun cocks*)
Hey! hey!
Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus Christ, man
Alright, alright, here, fine
What's this shit? Two CDs?
That's what I've been tryin' to tell you, man, there's two albums
Just get out!
Alright!
Get the fuck out!
Alright, man, see you later
(*bottle smashes*)



[Steve King]
Kume bai yah, kume bai yah, kume bai yah, D-12, kume bai yah, D-12, kume bai yah
I've had a special request for...

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers, but nothing compares to those blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice boy who's counting?
But nothing compares to those purple yellow blue and pills
Cool, calm, just like my mom, with a couple of valium inside her palms!



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match ("Here, Momma, try 'em on")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass



[Intro]
Psst, hey, listen
La la la la la la la la la laaaa
I love my job
Makes me feel like Superman!
La la la la la la la la la laaaa
Can you fly? I can, wanna see?

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really shoulda fell but I stood, see, I came
Like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because—

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
Just tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'Cause I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids will copy? Prob'ly millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then, 'cause—

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarming rate; common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, "Slim, you great!"
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but—

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

{Backmasked}
I'm not here to save you
I'm only here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine



[Intro: Ken Kaniff]
Uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home beating my shit to death
I'm listening to The Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff and I'm still mad as hell
Fuck you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm crazy with this razor, with this razor, I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed, I'm crazy!
(Okay, I'm reloaded) Go bring Jay-Z!
(Tell them him I'ma ghostwrite for him) On Dre's beats
Ran in the ladies' room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it (ahh)
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank at the clerk
And handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her
Nut I didn't take nothing (thanks)
Every bullet came from the same gun, just from different angles
Cause I was picking strange places to aim from
(Man, I bet you fifty bucks you won't jump out the window, Shady)
*Crash* (Ahhhh!!) pay me

[Verse 2: The Madd Rapper]
Psyche! No bread, fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed
(Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy motherfucker, might shoot me a Fed
Or I just might start a fistfight instead
See as far as the dough go, I go loco
See me pumpin' gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro, mixed with cocoa
Jump turn styles, then run from po-po

[Hook: The Madd Rapper & Eminem]
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy!
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy!

[Verse 3: The Madd Rapper]
Yo, yo, I wish I'd been aborted, my pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss, I can't afford it
I'm trying to sell a O, my pops trying to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad cause my Rottweiler still shits on the rugs (Goddammit Spike)
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like
(Eh.... Oh... Dude
Yo, this shit is crazy... oohhhh..... This is incredible... ohhh....)
Fuck that, Slim, keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and you need some help
Word!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got a beautiful wife, kids, and a gorgeous home
What would make me jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight vicious, I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you with eight stitches
What, I'm gay, cause I hate bitches?
Slut, don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And I'll still be mad at the world even if it apologized to me (sorry)
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man
About to blow his fucking brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse
On top of his spouse, spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturing Michael Jackson
In little boys' drawers shopping at toy stores
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at you, with a baby in it (Yeraraer!)
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fucking pill mom, don't vacuum

[Hook: The Madd Rapper & Eminem]
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy



[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ha ha
Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe S's, I'd probably stalk broccoli, yes it's
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain they keep sobbing, like, "please stop it"
Aftermath, bitch, still Detoxing
Looking for us? We over here like we're eavesdropping
Apparently still mad over what I said last year
On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there
And try to act like I can't hear
What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down
Kicks me and socks me, ow

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 2: Karacter]
I'm not scared, I'm just a white kid in a black neighborhood
Side terror
Wipe off this fear, to not thinking clear
I need to get my head straight
I do feel like a Nazi in a Jewish camp
Concentration
A foolish act to puzzle you fools with the coolest raps like Rubik's cube that I stole just to solve then give it back
Stupid face your making bitch
Loose the mask
Oh wait
I'm sorry that's my bad
Looks like shit
Might be obvious and a waste of my time to say you look like the crap from a sewage plant
But as you were saying
Back to your rant
Lex Luther just got circles ran round his puny ass so fast his neck snapped and it dropped his pants
You've just been schooled by Clark Kent
Shopping at the market
In the parking lot next to your apartment and part from it
You tried to look hard as shit but you pooed your pants
And I didn't even get to use superman yet
And he's my strong suit
Fall soon back on, to attack these villains, and kill em just passing em back and forth, feeling em then put an axe in their nads
That's what I call a hacky sack bitch
Cut cut and pass
You think your lucky
It's Chucky the mother fucking assassin
Castrating stuck in the cabinet sucking a bottle of Aspirin
Preparing a statement while he sharpens his blade
Carves it across his face as he coughs
Testing his voice is it raspy
Nope, just naturally nasty
Get ready for the ass whooping he's bout to serve up like a double cheese burger from Arby's

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 3: Karacter]
Dearest resident
Don't flip past this channel and skip it
A paramedic is in your living room slitting scissors through your flannel get up
So get up, feel better, and add up what I said on that chalk board of yours boarded up inside your head
You're almost dead
I'm your guardian
Here we are
Reminiscing this shit as we walk down the hall of wits
Shelve these thoughts
Highlight reel of selfish tall feminist broads
Everyone that's screwed you over when they said they'd call
Seminar, phantom here I am sent to ward these demons off

[Eminem]
Off misogyny
Sodomy, how many chocolaty jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
No wonder you scoff at me, it’s still obvious I invented prick

[Karacter]
Rest in heaven, I'm evidently milking this game like
Her breasts are dripping
Guess I'm busy, but unless you bitches are seven teen and eleven months I don't want to hear the pessimism
Tell the rest I'm on readers digest while I'm on the toilet
Pizza sky rocket
Gossip isn't
Close to the shit
I must be fast, lickity split
There's no exaggeration, I mean it Brittany
A fan of Trina
Get's me like I wanna jam my weener in Christina

[Eminem]
And Serena and Selena
Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen
Give me a damn good reason to not wanna slip an Ambien in a Cappuccino
And try to have a threesome with Janet Reno

[Karacter]
Stuff her with cream like a spicy popper of jalapeno
Appetizer, my main meal's Destiny
Now, If I die I'll come back to haunt your back side grizzly
Capitalize the "Ass" in fucking Caspar and Wendy
As Detroit looking like a power outage, just a black out city
Crack house just down the street of McDonalds, where you lost your virginity
Oh dity, I'm out
Explosive, you're left with the call
You might want to

[Eminem]
Head for the fire exits, I'm coming through like a wrecking-ball

[Karacter]
Test us, we're scared of nothing at all

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace



(Eazy-E)
1,2,3, and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin' E
With the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my '64 rag top
I got a lot of juice
A lot of fuckin' block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap
Cuz I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers
Fuck no hapsters
I pack a Tech-9
Plus a AK-47
Send a one way ticket to my hell
Or maybe heaven, peep
Nigga I don't sleep
Burry muthafuckas in the concrete
You try creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast til I blast no mo
Yo, they call a muthafucka John Doe
Pussy nigga had beef knocked out of his teeth
The muthafucka should have stayed his ass home
Hey yo peep them bitchez in the Honda
4 deep with the proper ass sounds

(2Pac)
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls

(2Pac)
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls

(Eminem)
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis
Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin' the most current people on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Ca$his and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady Aftermizat back in that ass, you wizzass
Come hizzon what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that

(2Pac)
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls

(2Pac)
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls

(2Pac)
I'm barely standin, and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin through the street lights, cause we like, yo nigga
Get your mobb on show em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggas poppin, welcome to our casino, cause you and me know



[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay

[Bridge]
And I thank you, ‘cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, ‘cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

No more
If I go in VIP they don't need to see ID, right
(No more come on )
(They know who you are if you're going to VIP they know your face, you paid for it)
If you're gonna get buried it cannot be in the cemetery
If you are in the cemetery you cannot be buried
No more
(Leave it alone)

And you can't, you cannot

You can be like Mick Jagger but you... it's one or the other
You have to have one or the other
No more rhyming Mick Jagger with swagger, no
No more spectacular with vernacular
(You got to stay away from that one)

Why do you feel that you have to say that a pencil is a utensil
A pencil is a fucking utensil! Right or wrong?
It's already a utensil you don't have to make
(It's a double negative!)
Once you got the pencil you already have the utensil
The utensil is the pencil so you don't need to

You cannot use a vest to protect your chest
(Come up with some other shit
Come up with something else for it to protect. Get creative)
Maybe the vest protects your abdominals

(If someone's gonna murder you they obviously heard of you right? How do you...?)
I think we went we went over that but  I do think that is important to stress
Because if I murder you like I never heard of you
What is the difference?
Do I not feel as bad because I murdered you because I never heard of you?
(It's fucking stupid)
And if I did hear of you I might actually feel bad, it my weigh on my conscious or something?
(Royce: ...What kind of gratitude do you get from murdering a person you don't know anyway?...Yeah you wanna know...)
(You get no points. It makes no sense)

If you're gonna be near death it cannot be on your last breath
You cannot
You can't be on your last breath near death
But if you've got bodies it's not like John Gotti
You cannot have bodies like John Gotti
You cannot rhyme casket with basket, no more
Money, funny, honey, bunny, no more
(Static, attic, no, it's over)
If you like static, you cannot be an addict for it
(Moderation. Static in moderation. No addictions)
Moderation, static in moderation, static in moderation
(You cannot be addicted to static. Forget it. Those days are over)
You can't you can't
You can start static, if you start static just you cannot get addicted to it
If you become an addict for static, it's automatic
(Ooh you can't be automatic either. It has to be manual)
It cannot, yeah, yo
Manual and it cannot be -
The static has to be...
The static cannot be automatic

I think this is- I think this is good
(It's a good start)
Yeah
(I think they'll be a better MC if they follow these rules)
Yes, this will make you
If you really want to be if you really want to be considered one of the greats
(Mmm-hmm)
You can't do any of this shit
And if you're gonna keep it real, you cannot pack the steel
You can pack the steel but you probably shouldn't keep it real
Keep it fake
(Royce: Be a fake ass motherfucker)
Yep be fake with the steel or be real without the steel
You cannot keep it real and pack the steel
You cannot rip shop in hip hop to the tip-top, you just can't
You can't
(Stay ground level stay ground level)
Ground level
If you're gonna make me drip drop cuz I flip flop
I cannot be in flip flops

If you're a new up-and-comer right in hip-hop and you don't understand the history of hip-hop, that these things have been rhymes way too many times by now, we're just giving you, you know what I'm saying, “The Don'ts”

Listen I'm telling you something, I'm trying to talk to you, I'm telling you something I'm telling you something young 'un. You're coming up in this game? These are the fucking rules, like it or not. You cannot say this shit, and if, (Facts! Big facts!) and if you come up missing it cannot be like Hoffa. No. No more missing like Hoffa. I think they found Hoffa anyways, didn't they? Yeah they found Hoffa. So you can't. No more missing like Hoffa

[Narrator]
I gotta question for ya. What does this city know about luxury huh?
What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?
Well I'll tell ya. More than most.
You see its the hottest fires that make the hardest steel.
Add hard work and conviction,
And the know how that runs generations deep in every one of us.
That's who we are. That's our story.
Now it's probably not the one you've been reading in the papers
The one being written by folks who've never even been here and
Don't know what we're capable of.
Because when it comes to luxury
It's as much about where its from as who its for.
Now we're from America.
But this isn't New York City.
Or the Windy City.
Or Sin City.
And we're certainly no one's Emerald City.

This is the Motor City and this is what we do.



[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I be in
We'll see how much you be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout bustin' raps
And standin' for somethin': fuckin' acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what will happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon
Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers
Nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, ‘cause—

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank
Maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck!
But I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow
I'm stabbin' myself with a fuckin' knife in the gut
While I'm wipin' my butt
‘Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood
You're in a fight with a nut
‘Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle
Now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do: as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue
I'm showin' you the flow no one do
‘Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
‘Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
‘Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, ‘cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, ‘cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all







[Intro]
I have no idea what I'm doing
I have no idea what I'm doing, but

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
-live and he's flowing like the Mystic River
Girl dont act like you never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this a
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me, I disap-
-peared I was hiding in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop skip and a jump from my skin, gushing
Nails into my face that I been pushing
Hellraiser, my face is my pincushion
It's like when I'm on the mic, I can squish a
Sucker like a vice-grip, my pen put ya
In the slaughterhouse cause ya styles been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive someone put the brakes on

[Hook]
Here's a smidgen admitted to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, err ribbit, ribbit
I got ya slippin on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got ya slippin on my swag juice, my swag juice

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
I got it figure out now nigga
See, my minds on my money right here
And no one stopping how getting it
In hindsight, I never should have left where I was living
And probably wouldn't be getting pressed by all these women
And then again, I wouldn’t rap the ones I was diggin'
So annihilate the looking, and talking alot about the hood; Kim'n, Kim'n
Uh, so, Serena Williams, just like my dad talks about more John Dick'n
This girl talkin' how she pregrent, she crazy, so later I crushed that ho, and left baby
And never trust her, no shit! Even she specialize in massaging on my testicles
And I never trust her, a whole lot, even on the first date, she basically get her mouth rimmed
And turn around and ask me for a kiss, no bitch I’m straight
And I never really get concerned how my own dick tastes
I think I’m about to slip on my swag juice
I think I’m about to slip on your swag juice
(Oh, no! No! Don’t slip on your swag juice)
Ye, ye! I think I’m about to slip on my swag juice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there sister
Bound to get you dizzy cause he gets as busy as a
Bee, baby you can throw a frizbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? He's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it?
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick with ya
I want a kiss 'fore I blow this bitch to smithe-
-reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
-ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turntables and he cuts a record like a scissor
Cheka chicka, checka chicka, cheka-cheka chicka
Who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute, I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's six o-
-clock in the morning 'less you want to get some dessert

[Hook]



[Verse: Eminem (Paul Rosenberg/Sway)]
Let's take them back to the future (bars)
Bars, like Paul Rosenberg
The small frozen turd (don't censor me man)
Alright look, I had class, I just got expelled
I excelled at nothing in school
So if you're tryna test my patience it just failed
But King Mathers, I still get hailed
So call me sire, like I exhaled
After I had a deep ass breath held
I guess well, that'll make my size double XL
So kiss your highness's hinded ass
While I'm trying to stretch, it's time to exercise
I'm flexing, isometrics
Twice the reps 'til I get extra-sized
And set my bis and pecs and triceps on fire
Cause I'm coming out guns blazing
Like flaming pythons, my suggestion is parental discretion
Be advised, due to this mental aggression
We advise you to back up, like Byron Leftwich
I'm infectious, I rhyme like I got a sinus infection
A virus, I'm congested and I just ingested
Five Allegras but the side effects from these anti-depressants, they're tryna mess with my mind
I'm a regular Hyde and Jekyll
White with freckles but I silence hecklers
You might wanna head for the fire exits
I'm coming through like a wrecking ball
You would swear I think highly of Miley
And I respect her, the way I backhand her
Excuse my French, Montana, but I am worried about nutting
God damn it, I'm a sexist, I drive a Lexus
Textses out of her mind, and I'm in Texas
With a chainsaw, wait, what did I forget this
Time, oh, my machetes getting upset, he said
He was ready for me to come get him from inside the shed
It was time, he's restless
He wants to make blood shed like a storage unit
But before I do it, let me think this through
Cause if I behead this bitch then I'd be headless [slurping noise]
Mic check, one, two
I ain't barely check the mic just yet
And I just sweared like twice as many times
In less than ninety seconds
Than Andrew fucking Dice ever did in his fucking life
But I guess I'm expected to make these kinds of violent records
It's why I keep rhyming reckless
Fuck it, I swear, like a diamond necklace
Since freestyling over phone tap, my line's connected
With rhymes that kept in touch with the fans, that's why the more bars, the better my reception
And I give a fuck about sales, and fuck pop, I don't even like refreshments
Cindy Crawford tryna fend me off with a bendy straw
At the waffle house, awful mouth
But if you don't like what I'm talking about then block me out
Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down
Kicks me and socks me, ow
Apparently still mad over what I said last year
On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there
And try to act like I can't hear
What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
That's when my man Denaun Porter ran behind me to pantomime
That if you wanna kick his ass, stand in line
Hands inside my pants as I fantasize taking advantage
Of Brandy and Janet by grabbing my Spanish Fly
Like a blind Hispanic guy with his zipper stuck
Give a fuck, it's all part of my grand design
To get Amanda Bynes to come and fucking blow me like a dandelion
Better watch your step, you 'bout to cross an outlandish mine
I'm what you get if Aaron Hernandez rhymed
So stand aside unless you plan to find out how handy I am with a branding iron
Fuck talking clear so you all can hear
I'd rather rap like a fucking auctioneer
Fuck around and walk from here to the Southpaw premier
Get on Paul's back, rapping "Paul Revere"
So call me queer, cause I'm always weird
So praise a Genius, hope this don't get taken out of text
But Hillary, I promise to wipe my server clean if you face subpoenas
Got a name that speaks for itself like Anthony Weiner
Hands in between my pants in a theater, jacking my meat
A fan of Trina, Angelina, and Christina and Serena and Selena
Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen
Give me a damn good reason and not wanna slip an Ambien in the Cappuccino
And try to have a 3-sum with Janet Reno
I'm fucked worse than Donald Trump
On Lexapro in Mexico across from a Texaco in McDonald's drunk
Broke and out of gas, busted water pump
Getting fondled up by Ronald, feeling him on his rump
Oh yeah, and me and Alyssa Milano hump
We do
Bringing the horror to emcees like the aura of the Run DMC fedora
Addidas and Diadoras but I need at least three to four of those Rita Oras
In a four seater Taurus but tell them my face is the best seat in the house
I’ll let them bleed in my mouth while I’m eating them out (that’s disgusting, ow Jesus)
Heat seeking missile, duck, demented, sick, hate and see who gives a fuck
I invented prick, and that’s a true statement, I see the bitch in you Caitlyn
I keep the pistol tucked like Bruce Jenner’s dick
No disrespect though, not at all, no pun intended, that took a lot of balls (ay God damn)
Oh and Azealia Banks just wanna tell you thanks
Now I got trailer skanks sending me ballpark franks in the mail as pranks
And hot pockets, thanks a lot
Awful, I made monopoly off misogyny
Sodomy, how many chocolatey jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
No wonder you scoff at me, it’s still obvious I’m as off-putting as Bill Cosby is
Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe
S’s, I’d probably stalk broccoli, yes it’s
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain
They keep sobbing, like, “please stop it”
Aftermath, bitch, still Detoxing
Looking for us? We over here
Like we’re eavesdropping



[Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it
Then so be it, ‘cause nowadays these kids, geez
Don’t give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playin' them hits
"Oh, this my jam! This my shit!
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
‘Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
‘Cause we don’t know anymore what are hits"
Is it the beat? Is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our syl-la-la-bles

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc
Is in the beat, then I’m gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro'
‘Cause everywhere I go they love the "bling bling" flow
Bang bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost your man a lot of dough
Oh, the fuck am I bustin' my brain fo'?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow? You bought the shit
I guess you to blame, too, I just found an angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album droppin' with a reality show
Cock the MAC-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids
That just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu, Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30, interesting
'Cause ever since then it's been in a sense an extension
For veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last, then 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scramblin' over what to do
Gamblin', and every time we put a record out
Just lookin' for that hook (Wait, Dre, look!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
‘Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip-flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked 'round the globe
I'm sick right into shows, ridin' on lolos
Puffin' on coco, my bitch in Manolos
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, that's slang for dumb hoes
I'm playin', I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked, Loc
It's not a game, me, B, I ain't playin'
Beat behind me playin', so you don't hear anyway
You don’t hear what I’m sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny, bunny, money and funny
You ain't even listenin' and I just took your money, ha

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the fuck-offs, all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we back, fresh up outta the vault
Oh! New syl-la-la-bles, eat ball, you fuck-offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Fallin' victim to wax, spittin', bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I’m runnin' past while y'all walk

[Verse 6: Cashis]
Shady made me for bringin' it back
'Fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spittin'
About livin' in the mothafuckin' city you at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash, me, that's free karma
I'm everything, anything you can never be
It's a hidden rhyme of the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood, I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my windpipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I’m crazy, renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I’m Rosemary’s baby, I want you to hate me

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
‘Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables
Syl-la-la-bles, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme schmo, mo, Joe, toe and glow
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some



It’s not about lyrics anymore, it’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Don’t give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ’s playing them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
We dont know a word to a verse
All we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley’s got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn’t the beat
Than I’m gon feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Rove
Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost ya man lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
Its just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her “we in press heaven”
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable

[Dr Dre]
They said 30′s the new 20
Funny, must mean 40′s the new 30
Interesting cause ever since then it’s been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
Its all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook

[Eminem]
(Wait Dre look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[50 Cent]
Go shorty, its your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
Its the kid that flip flows who used to flip O’s
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I’m international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I’m sick right into show, riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked
Look, its not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beep behind me player, so you here anyway
You don’t hear what I’m saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[GR Lynch]
This ain't top 40 or hit list shit
Not for TRL, no Rick Dees' picks
This is straight GRL ski mix bitch
Call me Strasburg when I pitch this shit
I leave these other rappers so tongue-tied
They just local, GR's worldwide
You sound like cabbage, ya wilted outside
I spit tomatoes straight from the vine
Leave these other artists lookin all sundried
A bunch of little stains, to them I'm Tide
Keep a stain stick in my Subaru ride
Glass all black can't see us igniting
Paint white out like you fucked up writing
Mount baker bout to get a boost in style
In the parking lot they can't help but smile
Ma'am please cover the eyes of your child
Gunz come out you know bumpin 50
Subie 2 shes covered with bitties
Snowpants blue like the sign for thrifty
So baggy what are those a fuckin size 60?
Burrito legs bitch, call me big shitty



[Intro]
Tony Touch

[Verse: Eminem]
Don't ask me what's up with the hoes, I'm still working the kinks out
Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin' out
And I ain't chilling out, got an Oscar but I'm still a grouch
I use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch
Yelawolf, Shady, Tony-Touch, Slaughterhouse
Yeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out
Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
Nice try shorty wop, we can windowshop the jewelry store
But Christ for that price coulda bought a house
Besides only thing I ever had iced out was my heart since I started out
It’s F.Y.I, if ya ain't knowing
What, go with you? Where? Nah, ain't going
Oh wait, you wanna date? Oh, well in that case ho, it's June 8th, oh!
And kinda like Beethoven composin' a symphony of hate
So much hate woven into these raps
He stitches a bitch, straight sewin'
Shit, I'm beginning to hate clothing
I hate overalls 'cause they remind me of hoes
For Christ's sake, they're shaped like an H woah and
You know what else starts with H though?
Hockey, shit, thought I had the place flowing
I hate to put you on ice but
You already had 3 periods in 60 minutes, great going
Plus you remind me of cocaine, ho
You always in the mirror with your face
So, I feel an urge to put you all in a line
And chop you with a razor blade, yo wait, I'm an a-hole
Devil with a halo
Hell yeah, I'd nail J-Lo... to the railroad
Say I won't! Better hope you can stay afloat
When I take the wind out your sailboat
But, I ain't playing yo! Dope as Shady?
Don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat

[Eminem]
Uh, this is Marshall, I call there all the time
Um, who is this? (It's Frantz) Pardon?
(Frantz, Frantz) Frantz, ok, Frantz
What I wanna do, actually
I wanna get a-eh, eh, it's called-I call it
The Slim Shady platter, it's like, with shrimp, like, around it
And inside, it's like, um
It's like a piece of liver that they give me
And they-they put like, salad on the side
(You want a dry sheem or the sheem with sauce)
Wha-wil-- Blergh-hrm-be-lay-la?
(You want a dry sheem or the sheem with sauce) Shu, shu
Schwepp-a-hrm-de-lay-la!
[mocking accent]
Uh, hmph, I needed shrimp, I needed shrimp
Around, eh, the plate, what are you talking about
Ok? The sh-Ther shrrrimp (Huh?)
Goes around (laughing) the prrrate
(I don't have a clue what he's saying)
Ther- (Sheem sog or sheem with spinach)
Yes, yes, the fuckin'- the shrrreerp
Okay? Ther shrreerp, goes arrround the sarrrad
With ther liver, liver le-(cough)-erl
Chopped Se-lim Shady, Slim Shady liver
Okay? Served, a la carrrot on the ass for mama

Alright, I'm srrrerrry, okay

She in this still, what are you talking about
Okay? I fuck mama, hello?
Listen to me or no? Excuse me



[Intro]
Mc Double M and DJ Buttafingaz, take 87 and a half

(Ready?)

[Verse 1]
Man where's my papers?

New Jacks, meaning new don't mean jack
Not concerned about a sucka, and senseless crap
No time to waste time, in this profession
Too busy advancing, moving forward, progressin'
Agility, ability, got to stay nimble
My rhymes are not basic, as basic's too simple
Making corrections to fit perfection
Breaking rhymes and lines into different sections
New style intact, in fact rhymes are jam packed
Back to back, lines are being stacked
Every soul that I go, suckas look at me mean
I'm kicking ass faster a split in the scene
Provin' I'm not joking, fingers keep smokin'
Talk shit to me and your jaw gets broken
Step away from me man, don't try to play the role
Of a hero, cause that shit's gettin' old
Wanna battle me, that'll be an ignorant choice
Cause I'll pick up the mic, and take you out with my voice
If you act like a punk, then you're bound to get hurt
Cause I'mma grab you by your shirt and knock your dick in the dirt

[Verse 2]
Jumpin' on the bandwagon, you missed your ride
But don't you know you just committed suicide?
I'll mess you up like a champ, but we not in the ring
We on the stage so it's a whole different thing
If you're bigger than me and you're twice my size
Then it's time for my nine to be recognized
Consider yourself dead if my face turns red
Cause I'mma fill your ass with twenty pounds of lead
I'm not lookin' for trouble but if it comes my way
That'll be the funnest part of my day
You ain't never gonna make it cause you're just too sore
You're fadin' like jeans after every wash
You're seekin' a beef that could move your feet
And at the same time rhymes of the street
Well shit, this is it, though it may be slow
Know it's got a lotta crack, it's a sellout show
Standing room only, no place to sit
But you won't want to once the punchlines kick
They call me a klepto cause I sold the show
You said I'm up to no good, but you're in the front row
Difference between us is I'm first and you're last
So take your wack rhymes and stick 'em up your ass
Y'all wanna bite, I'll give you something to chew
Stick my dick down your throat, and I'mma say "Fuck you!"
You wanna battle me? Man, you best forget it
Keep running your mouth, I'mma put my fist in it
I'll make you eat those words you just spoke
Shove 'em down your throat 'till you fuckin' choke
And when you're gagging, and gasping for breath
I'mma hit you with a right and follow up with a left
Here's another example, I'll let you have a sample
Of the way I fight, my style's ample
Riding down the block on my way to school
Saw a sucker motherfucker thinking he was cool
Sucker flipped me off, I said "Stop the car!"
Max said "Show 'em how bad you are"
Jumped outta the ride, like a bat outta hell
The boy was terrified, I could just tell
He kinda figured that death was near
So he started swinging because of fear
Sucka kept swinging while I just ducked
Came up with a right and the boy was fucked
He fell straight to the ground, he was probably dead
But I ain't stick around to see how bad the boy bled



[Intro]
"You're going to be okay kid, you're going to be... okay"

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Uh, always been the type of dude that'd feed my clique
I know that without the fans, I ain't shit
But y'all better read my lips, I don't spit raps this ill
For you to just hack and steal and leak my shit, so peep my drift
I hope y'all don't think y'all helping me out
With that shit, that shit stressing me out
Nickel nine is blowin' up; Christmas time
You should hang my album on top of your fireplace
'Cause around that time, my stockin's goin' up
Feels like a victory bittersweet, 'cause the bigger I get
The bigger the wedge between the relationship
Of me and my bigger bro, hear what I said?
Feels like the shit was wished on me
Everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know
I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse to quit
Just straight shittin' on me
Keepin' your distance? Probably best
If you don't wanna fuck with me
But you know me probably best, fuck pity, you want that?
You know it's Laila Ali's chest: tough titty
The problem's you got a problem, you think that I'm already set
So I'mma look down on you?
Just be proud of me, you already got my respect
I ain't tryin' to say something I'd regret
So I'mma just stop chasin' the pain
And let you deal with the fact that we don't get along
'Cause I got a big face in the game
Sometimes I feel like fuck my life
I fuck with a few niggas that I know
If my chick was a Shady ho
Niggas wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my wife
Guess that's the difference in friends and associates
I done been broke, I done been through the motions
I don't pay no attention to birds
I use my scope and I tend to the vultures
No one ever blows up your phone just to talk
I don't make money just to loan it to y'all
Tell a nigga that then you wildin' is like dialin'
And then talking to a hole in the wall
Please look at these expenses, these niggas expensive
If I gotta lend you money every time I see you
Just to be your friend, bitch, I don't really need your friendship

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me
I give and I give and you take and you take
And you just walk away without nothing to say
You just take from me, ay, ay
You just take from me, ay, ay

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame
Trouble as the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say
When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away
To people who don't even appreciate flows, mothafucka
I'm livid today, 'cause I break my back to give you my art
You steal my thoughts, it's like drivin' a spike through my heart
You might not think it's that big of a deal
To steal from me, but music's all I got
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr
But it's getting harder than I thought
To not just go crazy, trapped in this house
I'm about to just snap
Am I not deserving of what I got, did I not work for it?
Put it all in every record I record, well then
Please tell me why on this Earth, Lord's it keep happening?
I keep rappin', but I wonder sometimes, is it worth all the bullshit?
'Cause it feels like a down there ain’t no gettin' up from
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb
I'm anything but glum, so fuck 'em
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they'll say it was ill, right?
The way I killed mics? But the way I feel right now
It just feels like I'm so done with this shit that I may as well wipe
I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute
Farewell, I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you
Ladies and gentlemen, Slaughterhouse, I give you

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me
I give and I give and you take and you take
And you just walk away without nothing to say
You just take from me, ay, ay
You just take from me, ay, ay



[Intro: Bizarre]
Check this out
This is Bizarre
And this is the rap king DJ Butter
From tha Outsidaz
Bam Bam Bam!
Dirty Dozen
Outsidaz
Taking the whole world with me
2 blunts and I'm bringing ya girl with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
I'm high like Redman
Trippin' with a tab of acid in my headband
The name's Pacewon I'll kick that ass quickly
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Four rhymes penetrate ya kidneys
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down)
Take it with me
Take it with me
The whole world with me
I'll be hittin you with rude shit
I be rollin' like crews with new whips
Call it stupid but I've mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
More rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho
Spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Ya crew not strong
They stink like ya mother's feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn
Me disciplining' fresh emcees that you'd be scared to rock for
I'm low down and I'm shifty
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Most emcees get slapped cause they sissy
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm in a soundproof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180 proof Vodka with Dr. Ruth
We in the vocal room inhalin magic markers
Sitting in the dark lightin our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the boards
Because we tied the engineer up with outlet cords
Bizarre's in tha lobby with the Beatles
Smokin bowls, pokin holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from poppin uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers
Smokin homegrown drugs
That's why you can barely tell what the fuck we're saying like Bone Thugs
Hittin blunts till my lungs get too much smoke
And take one more short toke before I snort coke
Shit, I been doing lines all day
My mind's all clay from smelling Pine Sol spray
What, no hold up hold up hold up
Smokin laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll up
My lungs are all swol' up about to bust open
I'm just hopin I don't die from snortin crushed Motrin
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
12 bluntz plus I'm bringin ya girl with me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
I'm not comin' back, so don't send no one to get me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Fuck that, gimmee all my shit free
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Wack emcees there's a new sheriff in town
Put ya guns down and die with an ill frown!
Tha Outsidaz doin uppas and downas
Clowners, even massa scared to hang around us
I'm a slob that don't have job
Peep through your window to steal the cook from ya mom
We just starters, ya'll niggas hit the bitches
Smackin more hoes than Jo Jackson has felony conviction
Clouds of mushrooms I just can't see
Pull me out tha bathroom I'm 'bout to OD!
Nasty, dirty some say I'm filthy
Everytime I drop a rap I'm a be like
MMMRRRRPHHH!
Crazy high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning diarrhoea
I'm ready to box so the bell go ding ding
My crew's more stupid and whack than Zazu from Lion King
Who's the big guy high off Chocolate Thai
If you disrespect me you'll lyrically die
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die I take the whole world with me
I'm bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die I take the whole world with me
Your grandma said I give as good as cleany
When I die I take the whole world with me

[Outro]
You know my flo is so ill
Emcees on the microphone'll get verbally killed



[Intro: Pacewon]
Some Outsidaz shit
I started hearing laughter in my head
Somebody laughing at me
Always laughing at me
I’m ‘bout to go crazy
So I started to set it on niggas, nah mean?
Pacewon!

[Bridge: Pacewon]
I’m high like Redman, tripping with a tab of acid
In my headband (‘Bout to lose my mind)
The name’s Pacewon, I’ll kick that ass quickly
When I die I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Raw rhymes, penetrate the kidney
When I die I’ma try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down) Take it with me
Take it with me, the whole world with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
Yeah, I be hitting you with rude shit
I be rolling like crews with new whips, call it stupid
But I mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
Raw rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Your crew not strong, they stink like your mother feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn, me! Disciplining fresh MCs
That you’d be scared to rock for

[Chorus: Pacewon]
(Who dat?) I’m low down and I’m shifty
When I die I’ma try to take the whole worth with me
(Me!) Most MCs get slapped ‘cause they sissy
When I die I’ma try to take the whole worth with me
Take the world, take it with me
Take it with me, set it!

[Interlude: Eminem]
Yeah! Eminem!
Dirty Dozen! Yeah!

[Verse 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
I’m in the sound-proof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180-proof vodka with Dr. Ruth (What!)
We in the vocal room inhaling Magic Markers
Sitting in the dark lighting our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the boards
Cause we tied the engineer up with output cords (Outsidaz, what!)
Bizarre’s in the lobby with the Beatles, smoking bowls
Poking holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from popping uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers (Uh, uh-huh, yeah)
Smoking homegrown drugs, that’s why you can barely tell
What the fuck we’re saying, like Bone-Thugs (Uh!)
Hitting blunts ’til my lungs contort, smoke
Then take one more short toke before I snort coke (What!)
Shit, I been doing lines all day (What!)
My mind’s all clay from smelling Pine-Sol spray (What!)
What! No, hold up, hold up, hold up (Hold up!)
Smoking laced weed wrapped up in a fruit Roll-Up
My lungs are all swole-up and ‘bout to bust open
I’m just hoping I don’t die from snorting crushed Motrin

[Chorus 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Twelve blunts, plus I’m bringing your girl with me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me
I’m not coming back, so don’t send no one to get me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Gimme dat)
Fuck that, give me all my shit free
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Wack MCs, there’s a new sheriff in town
Put your guns down or die with a ill frown
The Outsidaz doing uppers and downers (Uh-huh, yeah)
Clowners, even masters scared to hang around us
I’m a slob that don’t have a job (What!)
Peek through your windows, steal the good from your mom (Ma!)
We the starters, y’all niggas hit the benches
Smacking more hoes than Joe Jackson at feminine convention
Cop some mushrooms, I just can’t see
Pull me out the bathroom, I’m ‘bout to OD (D!)
Nasty, dirty, some say I’m filthy
Every time I drop the rap, Outs be like… (Ill, B!)
Brain’s too high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning gonorrhea
I made a box with a thugger on DD
Our crew’s more stupid on wax than Cowdy from Lion King
Who’s the big guy high off chocolate kai
If you disrespect me, you’ll lyrically die (Die!)

[Chorus 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Me!)
I’m ‘bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Lockin' it down!)
You bomb my set, I give her Good-N-Plenty
When I die, I take the whole world with me
You know my flow is so ill
MCs on the microphone and get verbally killed (Killed!)

[Outro: Pacewon]
All y’all niggas’ll get killed
Fucking with the Dirty D
Pacewon up in this motherfucker
All motherfuckers better act like they know
You MC, I don’t give a fuck where you from
Close to me or far from me
I’ma see your wack ass
Pacewon! Pacewon!



[Intro]
Yo, Dre Man
Make my vocals sound sexy... woo!
Come on, man, come on, man, okay

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm that guy man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl, now let's cuddle
Blood curdlin', you're gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feelin' wonderful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin' Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador
Of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her layin' a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap-on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio, man, rolling a fat one
Shady, drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn, man, are you that much of an asshole?

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me, homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm tryna maneuver the Hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fuckin' far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Wiener smothered in peanut butter, puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man, it looked nice, you should've seen it, mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap and watch The Sopranos

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, boom!
And assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read 84 bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
'Cause I'm scared there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Outro]
Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me... make me sad, I'm sad
I'm gonna cry... I'm crying
I'm going to tell my mom... Mom!



[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help

[Chorus: Kobe and Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)



[Intro: Ca$his]
Uh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're renegades (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're renegades (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hit me up, man!

[Verse 1: Ca$his]
Bitch I'm from the {nine}, yo' hood ain't no realer
You the pussy ass nigga livin next to the killer
I'm the killer that moved out of the block
And head back to the hood, when I'm movin my rock
You can find me, on a dark road, dark clothes
Lle', in the console and God knows I make grip off blow
Shit - I could get rich off blows
My nation affiation pitch forks I've chose
What the fuck you gon' do? We bang back hammers
I'm a six point star, in a gray bandanna
I'd die for this, nigga you rhyme for this
Pussy I ride for this, and did time for this
That's why I'm convinced you fear, that I'm convicted
Until elevens in soaps, and some gangsta shit man
Guess who gorillas leave tats infragments
Two shots through your cabbage, and gas from Ca$h

[Hook: Ca$his]
Pussy niggas always talkin that shit
What you flaggin, who you bangin with? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (I don't give a fuck)
Pussy niggas talkin all that shit
What you flaggin in your bangin whip? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (cause I don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Ca$his]
Tip our levels and scarce piece, a meal beast
We'll creep one deep, slump seat, dump heat
Niggas scream "Fuck me" he lucky, when I blast it
I left respect enough for an open casket
Way to go Ca$his, boost up my ego
Let loose, out sunroof with my Eagle
Folk of the century, rollin with peoples
The omen the sequel, the more they will see you
Close kin, molotov close to no skin
His momma pretends that she doesn't, know him
I'm the reason, for the whole "Say No" slogan
Doped in folk and loc'ed if provokin
Got a brand new thing, with the scope in
Leave your family, with the wake for hostin
I'll collect enough snow, 'til my hands the Aspens
I'm the realest nigga 'round here, ask for Ca$his folk

[Hook: Ca$his]
Pussy niggas always talkin that shit
What you flaggin, who you bangin with? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (I don't give a fuck)
Pussy niggas talkin all that shit
What you flaggin in your bangin whip? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (cause I don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Loadin the cup folk, loadin it up tote
Hang fire up I, choke from the gun smoke
That's on the boss mayn, my Nina Ross came
Place gangbangers, into a coffin
This is renegades, Rick not really paid
Gave Ca$h pistols, now they milli sprayed
Full bricks of raw, nigga that's really weight
While my workers foldin, now that's really cake
Give it right back to 'em, watch it regenerate
I'm a degenerate black bandit, livin ape
Niggas dig in they pockets like DJ's dig in crates
If you cuttin my profits, you gon' in to dish some cake
Heckler Koch and, glass and vodka
I'm the independent kingpin, cocaine Koch
Fo' thieve blow weed, plus sold O-Z
Niggas never son me, I was born O.G. fo'

[Hook: Ca$his]
Pussy niggas always talkin that shit
What you flaggin, who you bangin with? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (I don't give a fuck)
Pussy niggas talkin all that shit
What you flaggin in your bangin whip? (I don't give a fuck)
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with (cause I don't give a fuck)

[Outro: Eminem]
Ayo Alchemist!
Let's play 'em some of that new Stat Quo shit, man!



[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I’m tired, I feel wired but yet I’m still inspired
To find somebody else for the job, tell me I’m fired
Really muthafuck what they say, I did my job yo
Hood nigga straight off the block, I beat the odds
Now you see a nigga, back to the wall
Now you exciting, now I’m done
Everything for you niggas but get indicted
Got niggas in the feds wishin I was still with ‘em
Death penalty, go throw ‘em in the ail with ‘em
Rather die int he hands of the judge then former friends
Man this shit is like an ongoing movie, it never ends
Same nigga say that they would, love you forever
Niggas get the forecast and change just like the weather
Got me feeling like a whole brick, cut with some pain
From winter days yeah, they start of sunny and then it rains
And even after all these years, it’s still storming
You couldn’t of told ‘em it wouldn’t be like this
You coulda warned ‘em

[Hook: Eminem]
Somebody better explain
Why my ears are ringing so loud
Someone's got something to say
Grow some balls and say it to my face
(Somebody talk to me) Ooooh Oh, Ooooh Oh
Somebody’s got a problem, I wanna know
Keep my name out ya' muthaf-cking mouth
Somebody talk to me

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Walking like I’m talking, play it like I see it
And I swear sometimes I hear voices talking to me in my head
Some nights I slept for months, the living dead to get this bread
There’s two ways out this shit, a casket or the fucking fed
I rap cause one day I pray this might be my escape
Everyday I seal up these bags, seems like I’m sealing my fate
My momma worked at your gangsta, jumped off the porch out the gate
But I can’t let my momma bury me, thats some shit she can’t take
Most niggas hate when you come up and you doing something constructive
Police to the politician, my whole city corrupted
Wanna convict me for a couple transactions that I conducted
And my homeboys just might snitch under pressure
So muthafuck ‘em, it’s just me and my two nuts
And you can bet they gon hang
And bitch my resume gon’ check out til I check out the game
Sometimes that ski mask on my skull it took effect on my brain
And I still didn’t tell the shit, I’m sick of telling you man
Somebody talk to ‘em

[Bridge: Eminem]
Somebody talk to me
Somebody better explain, how my name’s ending up in your mouth
Somebody talk to me
Got 2 seconds to talk, I want some answers right the fuck now
Somebody talk to me
Cause if it’s me that you’re talkin’ about then I, I wanna know
Somebody talk to me
We almost past the point of being able to talk this shit out

[Hook: Eminem]
Somebody better explain
Why my ears are ringing so loud
Someone's got something to say
Grow some balls and say it to my face



[Intro]
D.A

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Slide on a pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift the hand
3 million cash, call me rain man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong word, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. 'What Kind Of Car He In?'
In the city love my name, nigga I ain't gotta say it

[Chorus: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, fuck what a nigga say

Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah that's cool but he ain't like me

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
From the BART train to a tour bus
Still the same game except I'm pulling more sluts
More butts, more bucks, never giving more fucks
Did it my way, I'm never taking short cuts
Raised in that town like fool, who put you upon?
All these bay sounds, Mac Dre is who I grew up on
I'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon
You can check my resume, see every beat I threw up on
Smoking on grapes, rollin' up swishers, no papes
Back of the Ghost, closed drapes
I'm a boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high, I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room
She wants me to slay okay, that means doom
Boom, and it's to be expected
Knew this would happen as soon as she texted

[Chorus: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same, like Mary-Kate
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah that's cool

[Verse 3: Offset]

Aye, aye feed me grapes Maybach with the drac' (grape)
Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae (skrt)
Diamonds up to par, the cookie hittin' hard (hard)
The Rari sit in park, I'm at it, on Mars (mars)
Shotgun shells, we gon' always hit the target (blaow)
Popcorn bitch shell poppin' out the cartridge (pop it)

Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley (ride)
She wanna keep me company and never want depart me (no)
(Depart me) Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot (skrt, skrt)
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya (Yeah)
And I got the fire, don't make me spark it out ya (fire)
Keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet (hoo)
Like the way she suck it, suck it like a Jolly (whoa)
Stack it up and put it with the whole project (racks)
And she got the Patek on water moccasin (water moccasin)
I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy (hey!)

[Chorus: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same, like Mary-Kate
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah that's cool

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeahhh, me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we (we)
Pasted, plastered, puke, drink up, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin
Still got a few chunks on your shoestring showin
I was dehydrated 'till the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit

[Outro: Tyga]
Taste, taste, she can get a taste
Taste, taste, let you get a taste
Taste, taste, do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me
Taste, taste, LA you can get a taste
Taste, taste, Miami you can get a taste
Taste, taste, Oakland you can get a taste
Taste, taste, New York do you love the taste?
Taste, taste, Chi-Town you can get a taste

Taste, taste, worldwide they gon' get a taste



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah! Come on! Come on!
ATL! Yeah! Haha! WOO!
If you feel like you've been touched
By our music that is

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nowadays everybody just wanna poke their nose up in our business
What is this some kinda joke?
Man, everywhere I go all I’m hearing is more talk
"What’s up with Jada and Fat Joe?
Doing a song with ol’ boy on a song “New York”
Man, I thought you just did a song with them both?”
Man, the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass revoked
I never had no ghetto pass, you asshole
You really wanna know, when I did live in the ghetto
I kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
So I suggest you get your facts straight before you go
This assuming to know
I ain't grow up in no trailer park just cause I was poor
Man, this is my testimo...ny to those that don’t know
Me, and feel like they do
If not to feel compelled to go and speak on me too
So this dick goes to YOU and this dick goes to YOU
And if you feel like you want it then you can get it too
And when your through pass it to the person next to you
Ayo, Stat get on the mic and come and spit a few

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Motherfucker's so quick, to spit bullshit
Stat Quo, who’s this, Em gave me the assist
Shorty got a full clip, standing in the pulpit
A–Town misfit, repping that south shit
Back four or some years ago, foe was hating, I hear them
My flow is skating across the track, rollerblading
Losing patience, want to get on chasing but this taking all my energy
Tired of waiting, people faking fronting like they kin to me
When they're really enemies, give a fuck what it is
Cuz, this what it gonna be, Shady/Aftermath lately
GMM, baby, young nigga out them projects Thomasville
Grady hospital, Freida’s only baby
Niggas biting my style get rabies
Fuck you, pay me, eat a cock, swallow shit
And plus you ain't fucking with this, so don’t trip, ha ha
Don't abort this, what an incredible twist
I write incredible script
That fit in with the plot it’s endless
Now testify to this
Let it bang when you hear, this is classic shit



[Hook: Stat Quo]
I'm the next one next one
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me with me
Got a problem shorty come get me
Nah, I ain't Dr. Dre, nah, I ain't Eminem or 50, dog I’m Stat

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
As I think back, retract, from the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum, bein' broke
Fuck, with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem
I was trying to get on demo tapes state to state
Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hopin' my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting (?)
I would wait for these A&R’s say I ain’t grind bitch
Spendin' my last dime on this studio time shit
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for trying this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot, scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort

[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I'm patiently waitin', used to get love
Now the same niggas hatin', wanna give me slugs
Partner don't get it separated or twisted, you can't fade it
Stat's the wrong motherfucker to play with, understand me

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you opened up your ears long enough to listen
You may hear what you've been missin' out all of this time
I've been put in a position to put all this in position
So quit your bitchin', learn how to rhyme
Get signed and get your shine

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's like this and like that and, uh, welcome to Statlanta
Shady Aftermath and, uh, a brand new rapper from Atlanta
Who goes by the name of Stat Quo
Introducing our new excuse to keep producin'
Continue to do music, use it and expand it and make rap grow
The hottest new shit on the planet, on a new plateau
But don't confuse it, you don't understand it
Let me break it down for you to show you how we do shit
So that you cats know, this is Statlanta 101
Cause we don't want no one walking out this motherfucker with tunnel vision
So anyone with questions you want answered
Just ask and we'll try to unmask them and maybe explain why so few cats blow
Just spit the truth when you get in this booth and do that though
That there boy hot to death, you already knew that though
Is he the greatest from the ATL, we got haters all day to debate us
So we'll just say this: he's one of them not to tackle

[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I got caviar wishes, box Chevy dreams
CD covers, TV screens
The booth or the block, might go to triple beam
I'mma make it right, hear me, huh huh huh
Fuck what your saying, God put me here to shine
Going on tour or white collar crime
The rhyme or the grind, MPC or the nine
I'mma make it, I need mine, huh huh huh

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
I can care less, fuck y'all, you don't make or break me
Real niggas love me, pussy niggas hate me
Down bitches ride for Stat Quo, they know
The A-Town D Young County be trill folk
Didn't no other label offer me no deal
Till they found out Shady/Aftermath was interested
Then they started to beg, want the truth, there it is
This ain't a gimmick, this the south and I be that kid
Just ride through watching lines of his rhymes
In time you're going to find you're on a great trip
Ain't a word I could life be some extraordinary shit
The piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo, you son of a bitch

[Refrain]



[Intro: Ca$his]
Shady Records own, bogus boy
Ca$his, it's Ca$his nigga, ah-ha ha
I'm here, right back on y'all, nigga
Blocc Boyz, what the bid'ness is, nigga
Seven-fo', let's go!

[Ca$his]
In this industry, a fifth of Hennessy
I'm tryna get with the bid'ness so where the bitches be
When I flick the Vogues, I'ma get the hoes
In a seven-fo' Lincoln black, two do's
Hope to strap shorty, take a ride with Ca$his
If a nigga look wrong you gon' let him have it
Say, what's your name? What kind of set you claim?
I'm seven-fo' now; tell me, do you bang?
We ain't ask about your mayne, cause he ain't here with us
And we both know that we about to fuck
You see my limo tint, but they can't see you bitch
Go and pull out my dick, and put your mouth on it
If you don't do it now, you'll never get the chance
If you ain't puttin out bitch, make other plans
I still keep my money in a rubber band
With the pitchfork sealed up, on the other hand

[Hook 2X: Ca$his]
You see them niggas runnin, you see my spinnin drum and
You lookin at my face sayin that nigga a gangsta
Always gettin blunted, and holdin stacks of hundreds
And e'ry rider here know that nigga a gangsta

[Ca$his]
Seen switchin lanes, off of sniffin 'caine
And a sip of purp', I'm hurtin on my drank
I've been doin work, you know about my gang
You want me you can find me wherever that you hang
I got a bigger dick, plus I'm fly as shit
You've seen me with your bitch, cause I got benefits
I'm a militant, AWOL lyricist
Your face menstruates when I clap-clap, period
I snatch cakes off the, back of you wack nigga
Shady Records in your mouth, take that nigga
Em I never leave, forever got your back
And e'ry soldier in my squad feel like that
Gangsta disciple, you motherfuckers know
You should've killed me, a long time ago
I'm a regular ev-ery day psycho
Hat to the right on sight wherever I go

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
I've been provin this, for a long time
And e'ry line that I write, is all mine
See me walkin a straight line in daytime
But I spray nines right in front, of the one-times
Livin life, in the California sunshine
But I'm the only star out, in the nighttime
Flagged up, knowin suckers ain't gon' like - I'm
Makin them turn they head straight boy just like mine
Took the West over, I'm the real king
You don't believe me, fuck you, kill me
I don't fear none of y'all, meet a real G
Come against me, pussy nigga you will see
When you awake, and you still sleep
You dead you lil' pussy boy, feel me
You said you was gon' muh'fuckin kill me?
But you bled, guess you ain't that real, G
Screech

[Hook]

[Outro: Ca$his]
That nigga a gangsta nigga
You stupid ass niggas don't know what a spinnin drum is?
That's a 100-round shot clip, comin straight at you
Your face, your back, your chest
It don't matter to me nigga, and that's real
I got guns nigga, I got money nigga
I got riders, what the fuck you gon' do to me?
I got guns nigga, I got money nigga
I got riders, what the fuck you gon' do to me?
Nuttin, Shady Records own, bogus boy
Ca$his, King Mathers!
It's brought to you, by the great King Mathers
I'm out, let's go! {*echoes*}



[Hook 1: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in
Knowin' everybody knowin' that I’m sewin' up the game
Destroyin' like they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind

[Hook 1: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate, not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight-grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (that's it)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (bitch), but she know I’m rich (I'm rich)
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish–sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it
Double timing it, but I still spit triple the amount of
Insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dawg
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

[Hook 3: T.I. & Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it's over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
TIP told me on this ho tip, best tip I could give you to hip you
Is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig you, ho? Take a shovel and dig you some dignity, bitch!
Shit, you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone, tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, it's you, but fuck ‘em, TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin' like a villain
Like the penguin in its fuckin' igloo eating fudgesicles
I’d rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie the fuckin' knot I’d tie you in one, bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin' dumb is you?
I’ll give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here’s a penny for your thoughts
But it won’t buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official, so blow the whistle, I got a trust issue
There's a bombshell: Scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin' cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin' stud, slut, this'll
Teach you not to come drunk stumbling my way, for shizzle
I still live like I budget a Gilbert's Lodge check stub, bizzle
So fuck Sizzler! These checkers are bust like a blood blister

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me

Man, I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn’t a restaurant, well, I guess I’m wrong

And we see just how you laying and we peeped yo' style out

That's how niggas get fucked up!
[Proof]
No love at home with your kinfolk
And the world just keep fucking with your mental
And all these kids making fun of your trench coat
That's how students get shot up!
[Kon Artis]

[Kuniva]
When your mans hook you up with a bitch
Over the phone and when you see her she ugly as shit (god damn!)
Now at the end of date she want a kiss, AND some dick
That's how blind dates get fucked up!
[Proof]
Saying we not a real crew with a lot of skill
And only one nigga in our crew make the dollar bills
Y'all fools just mad cause y'all ain't got a deal
Local rappers talk too much!
[Kon Artis]

Manager tripped the alarm and you all get stuck
Cops got AK's, y'all only got pumps - that shit's just dumb!
That's how Cool C got locked up!
[Swift]
When yo' ass wanna walk in a club
Instead of telling you to wait, the nigga wanna push and shove

And gather all your homies up to go and shoot up a pad
Soon as you finish y'all run out of gas - you better haul ass

Got your girlfriend sucking on my left nut
Your parents don't like me, but guess what?
Cause Bizarre don't give a fuck!

Chokin your wife all in front of your peeps (bitch!)
She toss a brick through the window of your Jeep
Get back together by the end of the week, that's so sweet!
Slim and Kim argue too much!

Invite a ho to your house while your bitch is out
Now you got your dick all up in her fucking mouth
Pull it out and then you bust off on her favorite blouse
That's how Clinton got caught up!
[Kon Artis]
Steal cars, wreck bars, get fucked up beyond
Recognition walk in titty clubs like we stars
Our mission every day is just to smoke bongs and fuck bitches in thongs
That's how Runyan Ave. is cut!

When your life wasn't raised up right
Then see your mother coming home with different niggas every night
And then you run into the one you don't like; so get the FUCK lost

[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip-Hop culture, y'all
Brought to you by the world-famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword-play, tongue-twist piercin' holes in you
You can't escape 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops the trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification

[Interlude]
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin', look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the Midwest
Leavin' MC's listless on the Wake Up Show
Make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher
Partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vild!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with white out
‘Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (Where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window, and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch!"
Pull a 9 out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped—fuck rape!
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many freakin' needles I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control—locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
‘Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can wake up
The X-Man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin' from high noon to the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts
Bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of skin
So the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked: "Why did he have to die like cast metal?"
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the TEC with the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board, like checker play
When I blaze, your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the tre, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the Heck and K
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to, but what you gon' do with it?
Tech can give it to you, but what you gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but what you gon' do with it?
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what!

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time
The most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us
In the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style filed sexual harassment, like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style, like JonBenét Ramsey
Now who the master to beg?
Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin' with Sway and Tech
My TEC's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X—bring KRS in!

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One comin' with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget: the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin' to rock in the middle of dry
And in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway and a Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you
Now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back, but for now just seckle
Ha ha ha! Fresh for 1999, you suckers!



[Intro]
I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

[Interlude]
Alright look, I'mma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

[Verse 1]
You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove I was even
Worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 2]
Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell outta the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like 5-6
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and 70 some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me
Some old fake pictures
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that pictures one of my relatives

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 3]
You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Cashis, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Outro]
Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!
Cuckoo, cuckoo, tweet



No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man (When Eminem created Slim Shady)
Behind the lies (DJ Cinema)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (He really started to connect with people across the world)
To telling lonely lies (Have outraged just as many people as the won over)
(Mardi Gras)
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep and I'm stillmatic
The way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still
It's like tryin to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped just knowin any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if
Bush rapped I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money you can't pay me enough
You to play me
Is cock-a-mani you just ain't zany enough
To rock with shady
My noodle's cock-a-doodle
My clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose
Yeah the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor I'm numeral uno
If Assuming
There's no humor in it no more
You know I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need fag to come a tear a new whole in my ass
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind the lies
No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To telling lonely lies
Damn I ain't never kill nobody I promise
An I promise if you try me
You gone hafta to rewind this track
And make me go back that thing'll go 'lack''
That boy'll lay flat so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm an I'm masturbatin
Black peter pan fly till I die
Wat u sayin Bathe in ape
Eve Saint - evie sue what I stay & gat me feelin'
Like scarface light the cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four seater
You know I be high get right in the four seater
Top floor of the four seasons
Four of them whores
An they all know how to cook it up
An look I got some and only one know how ta bag
Bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world so homie bundle up
Clean on this grind full or not get your hustle up
No one knows what it's like (I know that you put a lotta pain in your music)
To be the bad man
To be the sad man (Some of it comes from def jam)
Behind the lies (bein frustratin with other niggas)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (Some of it comes from my chick pissin me the f*ck off)
To telling lonely lies (I'm feelin a lotta pain)
(Mardi Gras)
I'm dealing with some shit homie
It's in the back of my head
An it's some shit homie but I just rap it instead
See I got wolverines bones in me but
The whole worlds throwin stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a childs mother and I hate her to death
But that's my childs mother so that's my
Mate to the death it's wow how I love her for
For putting little me here
And me and her could be forever
She gonna still be there
Then it's some other niggas
I judged the character wrong but
They some other niggas
Now let's get back to the song
I gotta Drug Problem
That I ain't tending to, cause I gotta enough problems
An my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to Pcp and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately
But nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately
I'm sorta feeling repressed lately
So ya'll been hearin and seein me less lately
Like does anyone notice the regress lately
Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed alota regrets lately
Yeah
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do
An I blame you
No one fights back as hard on their anger
None of my pain in the world
Can show through



[Intro: Green Lantern, Eminem & 50 Cent]
Okay (Yeah)
It's about that time again (haha)
Green Lantern (That's Right)
G-G-G-G-G Uni-*burp*
Hahaha, Shady
We back (Invasion!) Part II
The Conspiracy

[Hook: Eminem]
Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And E must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby
This is Shady I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown, trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute I'm rambling, back to the matter at hand
It's Green Lantern with Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we, yeah me and 50
Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga God damn it's all a plan devised by the Man
It's a conspiracy...against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits
Or ain't dope lyrically, so fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be see, and I got what it takes to rock the mic, aiight!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
Cause your magazine's over in less than 6 months!
Haha, Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking, cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks



[Intro]
Braveheart...

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Verse 1]
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death and I'm buggin'
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mother's life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary would've an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Verse 2]
I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters
.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on it's a new day
Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross, I carry the cross

Eminem riddled everyone by posting the squared picture of "The Equalizer" on Instagram - the movie with his favorite actor, Denzel Washington.

Just a day later, trailer has arrived.

It features Sia's singing and Eminem, most likely, singing a bridge to song. This snippet would be from their second collabo, with "Beautiful Pain" being first.

Eminem is most likely to do a full soundtrack, maybe even a music video for this song and/or make a cameo.

Stay tuned for more info on the song. As for the movie, it's coming 26th September.



[Verse 1: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
"Bill Clinton, hit this and you better inhale"
Cause any emcee that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten-speed
Screaming at Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
Eff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up 'em
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em
The rap struck 'em harder than getting hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper that trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'm a climb the Empire State Building
Get to the last step and still have half left

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Pompous, roll with monsters and dons for accomplices
Cock non-fiction concepts constant
Bomb threat and I ain't even on yet
On spec, I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet
Lightning in the clouds, start a fight in the crowd
Hyper and loud, get this mic in your bowels, biting my style
Attack all of y'all, react on the thought of y'all
Slaughter y'all, I'm calling y'all, in fact, I'm blackballing y'all
More official than an ordered pistol aimed toward rappers
Blame fame for it, shrapnel bits tore the tissue
Burying the [?] under the gravel
Saw off the pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience
My odyssey carries the [?], compare me to Phoenix
Solid and hard and light up a star, I got to be Venus
Huddle and bomb back, take cover and all that
And try to not die, you not rugged enough
You just shook as soon as I step foot in this rap game
I'm a bubble on contact like peroxide, I'm touching a cut
You stuck in my raps, [?]
Y'all sucking my ass, boosting my confidence a buck and a half
I know the game, I'm a train trapped inside a name
And whoever they taught me, yo, we ride the same
I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change
Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This 9 is lifting you six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with six shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now)
No pun intended, just hop out of this whip
And leave it unattended 'fore I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute
Cause I can leave your Infinit' full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans'

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
You get laced by the gun in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the ton, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative thrust that a enemy
The impact'll be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black boy since birth, burst and tore the womb up
To hit the earth like a asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Anybody can say, "Eff [me]", and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man, and it's hot, I'm out of my head
From the bottom
I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise an eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store
Switch up the breed of emcee and stick a chick up
Vigorous speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I done crushed all ya'll, now you want a collaboration
But eff that, you stepped up, so I'm a eff your rep up
And tear the rest up with every joint that I press up
So stop violence or violence'll stop you
Got crews iller than anybody on your block do
I roll with a white boy that pop 'shrooms
Listen to rock tunes and jump in a costume and rob you

[Verse 5: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
"Hi, Renée, I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?"
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up
You talk a lot of ish, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
Demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, trick, it's an image, I live it
Give a what? I don't know what a "what" is to give it

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
I grab your throat and squeeze it until it's swollen
Then exceed it until it explodes over your shoulders
Pick up your urn with ashes in it and piss in it
Diss intended to verge like a hearse with a witch in it
No more do I battle emcees for fun
Now it's guns and niggas should run from the [?]
It's barely vivid you witness rare exhibits of terrorism
Through Israel and the art when even they're dark and dismal
I'm a deranged breed, shoot me
I'll catch a bullet in my teeth
And spit it right back at you at the same speed
I'll injure if I'm offending you, we can go to blows
Even my interview should be a Hip-Hop Quotable
You can have the title, that's for brothers that's cocky
I'll take the belt with diamonds in it like Ted DiBiase
I'm rebelling your chains, in fact, you wack
I'm telling you the plane still spelling your name in your raps
You're soft-hearted, I'll say, "Let's take it to the streets"
You'll start pleading with me before we can get the walk started
I'm a deranged breed, so don't try to touch this
5'9", I told you I don't know the chorus

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career
And walk away with the floor, so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you out of ten floors
Pull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This trick wanted to blow me, I said, "It ought to happen"
"You swallow nut, girl?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing
Cause I sent her mother white water rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocking my U-Haul
Screaming, "You ain't moving here"
"Lorena Bobbitt, come here, want a souvenir?
I've been high as "L" since I was a juven-eer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Said you want a little company
And I love it, 'cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be
Your pill refill and I’ll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly we hit the flight deck and got sprung
(Pww!) Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills
Just the effects of each other, but we gon' film
'Cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that…

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2: Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard?
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you’ll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him, just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that…

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

It's hell to be Shady
Yesterday I yelled a degrading insult
At an elderly lady
Then I asked her how it felt to be eighty
Fuck a senior citizen
Suck a wiener, sit and spin
And why you driving so slow for
Don't you wanna get where you going faster
Since you probably gonna die tomorrow
You old whore, die old bitch, die
Before I murder you



[Intro]
And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark
And fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any—it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids say no to drugs (Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm…)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dump (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)
[?] (*fart*) (Ew, ahh!)
La la la (So fucked up right now)



[Verse 1]
Hey there, little boys and girls
Hey there, little boys and girls (Mmkay?)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
(Huh?) Say hi Bob! ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job
'Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock

And fake like he walks his dog, drag 'em in the woods
And go straight to the chopping blocks
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face
And said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said: "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off
'Cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
(AAH!) And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any—it's bad for you

[Hook]
The kids, the kids!
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
(?) The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
You gotta save the kids!

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Hehehehe!)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends
At a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys (C'mon!)
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull {​​​*blblblblblb*}​​​
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal, barfin' {​​​*BLEH*}​​​
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"H- hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting the money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga (*gasp*)
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class
'Cause it's bad for you

[Hook: Teacher]
The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids-
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it- put it- put it- put it- put it-



[Skit: Eminem, Gary]

["Everybody's Looking At Me" plays in the background]

"I'm gonna kill this bitch. I'm gonna kill her. I'm going to fucking jail 'cause I'm gonna kill this bitch!"
"Yo, man…"
"What?"
"I don't know, I got a really, really bad feeling about this…"
"Man, would you shut the fuck up, Gary!? You always got a bad feeling, man! That's her car right there, just park."
"Alright, just let me park… I'm parking!"
"Fucking turn the car off, dawg."
"Alright…"
"Alright, we wait."
"We wait for what?"
"We wait until she comes out, and then I'm gonna fucking kill her."
"Man… you ain't gonna kill no one—what the fuck did you bring that for!?"
"Man, shut the fuck up, dawg. Just shut up. Fucking clip is empty, it's not—" [Eminem reveals the empty gun magazine]
"Man, don't point that shit at me!"
"It's not even loaded, bitch, look." [Eminem pulls trigger, unloaded gun clicks]
"Dude! God, I fucking hate when you do that shit."
"Yeah, but it's funny as fuck."
"Gonna fuck around and kill me one of these days, I swear…"
"Gets you every time."

["Soldier" theme begins to play]

"Is that her?"
"Where?"
"Right there, motherfucker."
"Oh, yeah…"
"Alright, get down, get down."
"Fuck, here we go again…"
"Get down!"
"…The fuck? You want me to get under the car?"
"Yo, who's she walking with?"
"The fuck am I supposed to know? You told me to duck down!"
"It's the fucking bouncer... Did she just kiss him..?"
"I don't think so."
"Dawg, sh—she just fucking kissed him!"
"No, she didn't."
"Sh—she's kissing him, dawg."
"No, she's not!"
"She fucking kissed—" [Eminem exits car]
"Aw, shit…"
"Come on." [Eminem runs off, yelling "Motherfucker!"]
"Marsh!"



[Intro: scratches by DJ Mighty Mi]

"Shady! That's me!" -> Slim Shady
"High and Mighty Trilogy" -> Mr. Eon
"Back with the flyest material" -> Erick Sermon
"Shady... Sh... Shady!" -> Slim Shady
"That that... that's me!" -> Slim Shady
"High.. High and.. Mighty Trilogy" -> Mr. Eon
"Back with the..."
"Funky... beats" -> Erick Sermon

[Verse 1: Mr. Eon]
Packing this third eye, pursue a Cyclops
They trade in they high tops for nice sized white rocks (Excuse me)
Words in my right, that pass my left ear
Your style is ass-out like the Bulls are next year (you're GONE)
Fear this veneer, you get stung like virgins
Who that cat splurging instead of rehearsing?
Tough guys, degentrify your high rise
Looking more like Ronald than them fucking Fry Guys
Go on uptown fucking senoritas
In Taco Bell screaming, "Viva gorditas!"
Bring all your dogs - I give em rabies
They never had a chance like my two aborted babies (WAAAH!)
Got Pope John Paul the 2nd, praying to Satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cooking up bacon
On barbituates with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliffs withcha, cause spina bifida

[Verse 2: Slim Shady]
My nine is lifting ya six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with twelve shots in mid-air
And four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!)
No pun intended, just hop out of your whip
And leave it unattended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
‘Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those
Even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen, while I'm gravediggin' with Marilyn Mans'

[Hook: Mr. Eon & Slim Shady]
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
Got a satchel? Flash it, I'mma take your last hit
And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone
I'mma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'mma detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Got a satchel? Flash it, I'mma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it

[Verse 3: Mr. Eon]
Yo yo, "Eon's wack now," how you think that?
Couldn't get on my record if you were shrink rap (can I get a rhyme?)
Desecrate a crate with these rhymes I be toting
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Let's go back in time and steal my whole steez
The Quickening, did a bris at the christening
I'm exercising, doing liftings and twistings
Instinct's the nicest, I keep telling you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you?

[Verse 4: Slim Shady]
(Here - buy this) I'm e-mailing you at the wrong website
And misspelling you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you
Escaped Bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted version of birth
Driving off, leaving a murdered virgin at church
The first person who searching the Earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they should have alerted the surgeon first (Kill his ass)
Get thrown curves, and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves!
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm taking off both shoes and sticking each middle toe up
(Fuck y'all!!!!)

[Hook: Mr. Eon & Slim Shady]
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
Got a satchel? Flash it, I'mma take your last hit
And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone
I'mma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'mma detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Got a satchel? Flash it, I'mma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it

[Slim Shady]
Any disease out there I'm willing to catch it
Slim Shady
All praises to The High & Mighty

[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna (Eminem)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

[Outro: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)



You have reached the voicemail box of: Suck it

Hey, Em. What's going on? It's Paul. Uh, I wanted to call you to let you know we're getting ready to shoot the "Monster" video. We got dates for Rihanna and she's gonna come out to Detroit and we can get it shot. We've got some concepts together based on your conversations with Rich Lee and I think we're ready to go.

So the basic concept is sort of like an Inception-type of vibe. The whole video sort of happens inside of your head and Rihanna, in the beginning, is gonna act as your therapist. And you answer into her office, you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off; we're not really sure. And next thing you know, you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career. And there's various stops along the way. We're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments.

I had to go home and get my straightjacket. Redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because I don't remember it. Dr Dre would say, "I'm glad to see you got your coat back on. The way things should be."

The scene from the "My Name Is" video, with you in the straightjacket and Dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office there.The song which recieved an Oscar for you ,yes "Lose yourself" will also be included. We're gonna go back and revisit "The Way I Am", with you jumping off the building, falling through the sky, with everything moving past you. And then we're also gonna do the classic Grammy scene, with you and Elton John performing "Stan".

"I can't see it all. Even if I could, it'll all be grey. But your picture on my wall, it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad".

So, all these things are going on in your head. You're travelling through the elevator, looking at it from a new perspective, with you watching yourself. And then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator, you come out and you see this sort of caged beast. And the beast is actually Slim Shady.

Slim Shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on. And then you see it's actually yourself. And Slim Shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them. And the idea that you keep feeding Slim Shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it. And the songs'll keep coming back out.

So, it's really kind of a trip. It's very surreal. Less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey.

So, anyway. Call me back after you listen to this. Um, I sent the treatment over, read through it and get ready for some really long days. Later.

I'm done. It's a wrap. Uh, I never want to perform in these clothes again. Way too small. I'm try'na go, like, quadruple X next time. So, these clothes are a fucking wrap too. Peace out.

And goodnight. Give it up for him, folks. Thank you very much.



[Verse 1]
I'm coming wit more reality than virtual
Watch my family circle you
Bashin you till he's purple
You fightin, look like a Teletubie
I don't think you want to fight with this King
I'm Joe Lewis baby! Knock you out, right in this ring
So you are a joke, containing no punch lines
Listening to the rhymes you wrote, waitin on the punch lines (Where you at?)
I'm murdering this nigga. Merciless with scriptures
Burning his ligaments, and serve him with your verses
Nigga, kill him
My hunger pains got my insides eatin themselves
But I love the pain; seein you die is a treat in itself
So many wicked ways - you're worthless like a bitch with AIDs
Get served bitch, like a tennis game
I'm trynna get blown and I'm very comfortably
But you rhymin, killin my buzz like a murdered bumble bee
King Berry Gordy's the name and I'm kicked stories thats strange
And I came to take over your brain with unexplainable thangs

[Hook]
(The pain) I came to bring it
It seems you really need (the pain)
I'm here to get wit you
Hit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)
It's better than pleasure
Just let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)
(The pain) I came to bring it
It seems you really need (the pain)
I'm here to get wit you
Hit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)
It's better than pleasure
Just let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)
(The pain!)

[Verse 2]
Stop lookin at me. And put the money in a big bag
Wit yo gay ass style, man you sound like you kiss fags
What would possess you to diss me?
I pull up in ten speeds putin holes in the side of your Bentley
Always talkin bout your 20 inches
Or your bitches ridin 10 inches of dick, hittin switches
I ain't no battle rapper
But I will gladly slap ya
Blast on this bastard, trap him
Then blast the nigga's adams apple
Witness my shoot cops, just to get in to a chase and
Hit you in your rooftop, watch that shit come out his basement
I ponder as I smoke dro
How can a fuckin gun so hot turn a body so cold?
Cause I got to braids stickin up, I'm just a rap character?
Just because you look and sound like every rapper in America?
Fuck all your moves, you kickin
Smack you for approval
Touch your neck, locate your veins
So I can insert my fangs. It's

[Hook]
(The pain) I came to bring it
It seems you really need (the pain)
I'm here to get wit you
Hit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)
It's better than pleasure
Just let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)
(The pain) I came to bring it
It seems you really need (the pain)
I'm here to get wit you
Hit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)
It's better than pleasure
Just let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)

[Interlude]
I came to bring the pain
Hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astroplane
I came to bring the pain!
Hardcore to the brain!
Let's go inside my astroplane!

[Verse 3]
The spirit of Pun and Biggie is in me
Mixed by the human beat box, and the switcher was sticky
I be hittin you in your temple quickly
You're a wanksta, stop frontin, please listen to 50
These garbage MCs trynna give me beef
Like I ain't starvin to eat
Sound so silly, like a girl when she's gettin boned swiftly
A fan let me hit it just because I know Swifty from D12
Now your female is goin home wit me
Now every big person that has low self esteem
Wants to be a Fat Killah know, it's on they list of dreams
Well, tell your momma she can not join us
She too enormous, must be under 400
She weighs more than 4 Corvettes
Don't be mad at niggas all in the streets
You kicked your ass in '93 when niggas was callin you sweet
Wishin time can rewind youm King Gordy'll hide you
In a place so far away, God can't even find you!

[Hook]
(The pain) I came to bring it
It seems you really need (the pain)
I'm here to get wit you
Hit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)
It's better than pleasure
Just let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)
(The pain) I came to bring it
It seems you really need (the pain)
I'm here to get wit you
Hit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)
It's better than pleasure
Just let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)



I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back

They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me

This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training

My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low? Bring in a truckload with a high-low

My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up

I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then

Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass

Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut

Shady man, I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not



[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio in MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let’s all stand up!

All of these women love Eminem
"Chigga chigga chigga Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who," "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on when you don't let loose
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for your mom to cook me a dead moose
"Kim never gave me a kiss, Kim never gave me a kiss"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give Kim a little flip

We ain't nothing but mammals -- well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other rappers open like antelopes
But if we can kill animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

Well, I do; so he sucks and so do you
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
This woman put me on blast on MTV

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just crap it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like his name is Caleb
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
Every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling

The Murda Mixtape; if you don't like it suck my penis
You know that little thing

The sins of our young

God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue

[Eminem talking]

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album
He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm Breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm...

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never it's not alright
So I'm Breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight



[Intro: Obie Trice]
Yeah
Aye, Em, you ready?
Herc, you got them thangs nigga? (you know)
Detroit city!

[Hook: Obie Trice]
There they go, them D-town boys carry the Calico
Whenever there's war, you gotsta know
Them boys got toys tear down the front door
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
You are not convincing
When Detroit blocks stay flocked with henchmen
Niggas get popped for instance, infrared dot for distance
Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pen shit
Straight detention, a nigga doing tension
Once released he on that music buisness
When viewing 106 and them cafeterias
Only to find that rap's actually serious
Deliriously resort back to crack and vigilence
Same shit that sent em upper Michigan
Us is pimping, a difference, from any city I visited
It's that Detroit spirit and if we in it, balling out till the ending, period
Use O as a reference to that sentence
The message I'm sending you, best just pay attention

[Hook: Obie Trice]
There they go, them D-town boys carry the Calico
Whenever there's war, you gotsta know
Them boys got toys tear down the front door
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

[Verse 2: Big Herc]
If you don't like how I act then blow me
I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me
Man what's up with that scratch you owe me?
Now run my chips before we fall out like Shaq and Kobe
Big Herc on a track with Obie, when you come to the D
It's cut-throat, better be packing homie
And niggas get they shit split for acting phonie
We're known for the Glocks and the choppas
These niggas'll rob you, leave you standing in ya socks and ya boxers
We got real G's and lots of imposters
I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rastas
Ya'll niggas ain't impress me yet
Ya'll yapping, not rapping, turn that shit off and press eject
See we known for the car shows, running from the narcos
Keep them bottles coming, we gon pop em till the bar close

[Hook: Obie Trice]
There they go, them D-town boys carry the Calico
Whenever there's war, you gotsta know
Them boys got toys tear down the front door
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Meat cleaver, leave a gash in a bitches ass
See her dreams of being an R&B singer diva
Leave her face, cut her from the waist
Ah man what a waste, of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangsta
It ain't just New York or L.A. that bangs no more
There's Latin Coun' Kings here
Southside, four, East Side and Gansen
Nothin' but ganglands and, spray paint cans
And when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancing
That window rolls down and that tre-eight's dancing
And them shooters don't miss, homie they hate chancing
Straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue Dodge flashing
Red and blue lights, no ambulance, you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no Detroit anthem
But just so ya know, if ya see them D-Boys passing

[Hook: Obie Trice]
There they go, them D-town boys carry the Calico
Whenever there's war, you gotsta know
Them boys got toys tear down the front door
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

[Outro: Trick Trick]
Here we go motherfuckers
This the motherfuckin back acha Trick
Don't even dream of fucking up in Detroit, bitch
This is where the real killers at
Detroit motherfucker!
Ain't never no difficulty smashing no bitch ass niggas
Matter of fact, bring your bitch ass to Detroit nigga
We got something for your ass
[Gun shots fade out]
[Laughter]



[Intro: Eminem & Royce da 5'9"]
Ayo, this next song is a true story (Come here, bitch)
'Cause some things in this universe
Don't make sense but somehow always seem to fuckin' work

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Flying down I-75, 'bout to hop on 696
I look over, this fuckin' chick's tryin' to fix
Her makeup, I'm like, "Bitch, you ain't a plastic surgeon
I advise ya to put up your visor, I'm gettin' kinda ticked
You're blockin' my side mirror," she's like, "Yeah, so?"
I'm like, "So? You gon' need a stitch you keep acting like that, ho
I look like your husband, slut? That's a rhetorical question
You talk to me like you talk to him, I'll fuck you up
In fact, get in the backseat, like the rest of my dates
No bitch rides shotgun; what? Taxi?
Stop and pick you some Maxi Pads up?
Is that what you actually ask me?"
Bitch reaches over and smacks me
Says I annoy the fuck outta her, get in the fuckin' back
Put on your slut powder, you slut, what?
And shut the fuck up now, or get your feelings hurt
Worse than my last chick when I accidentally butt dialed her
And she heard me spreadin' AIDS rumors about her
Turn the radio up louder, make it thump
While I bump that Relapse CD
Tryin' to hit every bump in that cunt
Thought I snapped back into accents
'Cause she kept asking me to quit calling her "cunt"
I said, "I can't!", she said...

[Chorus: Eminem]
Marshall, you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart
'Cause you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Uh, pull up to the club in a Porsche, not a Pinto
While Marshall's at a white trash party, I'm at drama central
I walk up in there lookin' at my phone, on Twitter, tweetin'
I'm feelin' a bunch of bitches looking at a nigga, cheesin'
I get approached by this little skeezer, she asked me
Am I the realest G? 'Cause I'm Gucci from head to feet
I said, "Yeah, I'm really is, 'cause I spit in your man's face
Like Cam did that little kid on Killin' Season"
She said, "I'm feelin' your big ego, wait, am I talkin' wrong?"
I said, "Nah, I'm a walkin' Kanye/Beyonce song"
She said, "I'm mad at you," I said, "Why?" She said
"Why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?"
I said, "I make songs for me, leave the studio, and go
And fuck the bitch who belong to who making songs for you"
She said, "I'm feelin' your whole swagger and flow
Can we hook up?" I said, "Umm, you just used the word swagger
So, no!" She said...

[Chorus: Eminem]
You ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart
'Cause you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We been riding around in this hatchback 'til I'm fuckin' hunchback
Where the fuck's this party at, slutbag cunt? Cut what act?
Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm tryin' to shag, skuzz
Better find this love shack or somewhere to fuck at
Ah, don't touch that, you fat dyke!
I'm tryin' to hear some "Bagpipes from Baghdad"
Don't act like you don't like 'em, them accents, I rap tight
And I'mma torture you 'til we find this place, yeah, that's right
Thought it was just past this light, just past Van Dyke
Better hit that map light, read them directions, oh yeah
You can't read, and you can't write, you told me that last night
She took my CD out the deck, snapped it in half like
"Relapse sucked," I snapped, hit the gas like
Blew through the light, spun out, hit a patch of black ice
Forgot we had a trailer hitched to the back, we jackknifed
Bitch flew out the car, I laughed like she deserved it
She didn't think I'd act like that in person
(Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club)

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
Tell him I'll be there in a minute
I'm tryna break up this catfight
Between my mistress and damn wife
Then a chick wanted a hug, she was fat, so I gave her dap
Then I tell her to scat, I'm not mean, I'm cute
On my way to the front door, takin' the scenic route
To avoid this chick with a lace front
Lookin' like Venus's and Serena's hooves
I'm just sayin', them chicks got horse asses, they been attractive
Hope when they see me
They don't slap me with they tennis racquets
My mind drifted, back to this shit: I see my wife push her down
Step over her body, then smack the mistress
Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vishis
Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin
He mugs the mistress, turns around
And gives the missus hugs and kisses
Looks at me twisted, like Nickel ("Yeah, watch this shit")
He smacks the dentures out of the mouth
Of the fat bitch he rolled with, and looks back to mention
"Royce, it's good to be back to business!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
They said, you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' our hearts
They said, you're breakin' our hearts
'Cause you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' our hearts
They said, you're breakin' our hearts



[Intro: Eminem]
[Eminem beatboxing.]
We should do something like that, yeah

[Hook - 50 Cent]
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!

[Verse 1 - Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous, Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his {ex}, a chainsaw and an axe
Choke a bitch to death, strangle her neck
While we have sex, while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the facts, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby, I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zie automatically
Says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it, I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this whack ass rap, kiss my black ass!

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Nah, Em, tell them to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tear you're ass apart
I came in this game crushin' motherfuckers from the start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the MAC home
Still grinding, still shining, nigga lord knows
You rocking with the kid to spit sicker sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
Everyday Dre day, front and cause a melee
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down
I smile through something fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fucking with straight stacks, I'm kicking you straight facts
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

[Hook - 50 Cent (Eminem)]
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head front, get fucked up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Now boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit your ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, (It's the Re-Up!)
Shady, Shady



[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (Evil, spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us." (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Oooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fuckin' industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date."  "Looks like an olive to me."
"Look, there's an apple!" No, it's not, it's a peach!
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eatin' a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners



[Intro]
*Schianto Aereo*
Yeah (Illa)
Yo, scriverò solo le prime cose che mi vengono in mente, e vedo dove mi porterà farlo, perchè ora mi sento come se volessi prendere a pugni il mondo intero
Yeah

[Verse]
Lasciatemi spiegare come creare la grandezza
Dritti fuori dal cancello, sto per romperlo
Non sono permessi errori, ma state sicuri, sto per
Stuprare l'alfabeto, potrei far alzare qualche sopracciglio
Se insisto sul problema solo per sfogarmi (Brrr!)
L' intera rivista potrebbe mandare via Staples
Selvaggio, ma non penso a nessun conto in banca
Ma troia, Sono libero dalle catene come Kala Brown
Testa di cazzo, chiudi la cazzo di bocca quando sto parlando, troietta
Aspetta scusa, qual'è il tuo talento? Oh, criticare
Il mio talento? Oh, troia, non so chi cazzo siate voi tutti
Per scrivere una barra schifosa o avere addirittura un' opinione o un pensiero
Parli di me, milioni di visualizzazioni, attenzione nei telegiornali
Parlo di te, sconfitta sicura per me, vittoria certa per te
Miliardi di visualizzazioni, i tuoi dieci centesimi sono due
Skippi la musica per scrivere recensioni di merda
Per fare visual, ma troia, hai solo acceso la miccia
Non farti ingannare, come sempre
La lista della merda è rinnovata, quindi trovati qualche merdata da fare
O fatti dissare perchè sinceramente non capisco
Che cazzo di merda ti stai ascoltando
Hai la minima idea di quanto odio questo schifoso flow
Quindi lo copiano tutti? Probabilmente no
Levate questo cazzo di audio dalla mia Audii, yo, adiós
Capisco perchè alla gente piace Lil Yachty, ma non a me comunque
Non sto nemmeno dissando, semplicemente non è per me
Semplicemente quello che sono è un emcee
Forse "Stan" non è la tua tazza di tè (Capito?)
Forse la tua tazza è piena di sciroppo e tè dimagrante
Forse ho bisogno di fomentare sta merda, preferibilmente
Far tremare il mondo se dipendesse da me
Paul vuole che mi calmi, voi tutti volete che sia pazzo
Dovrei prendermi una pillola, probabilmente lo farò
Il vecchio me ha ucciso il nuovo me, guardatelo morire dissanguato
Alito sullo specchio, non vedo il mio respiro
Forse sono morto, devo essere posseduto
Come una magia malvagia, Sono E-V-I-L (compitato EVIL)
Blocco una striscia sbiancante della Crest sulla punta del cazzo
Con un punteruolo da ghiaccio, lo metto in una tenaglia
Lo appendo ad un recinto appuntito, lo colpisco con una chiave inglese
Mentre prendo le mie palle e le smuovo su e giù come un interruttore della luce
Come il vicepresidente Mike Pence
Passo sopra le mie palle con una Sidekick  mentre le lascio su una striscia chiodata
Queste sono le cose che farei piuttosto che sentirvi rappare
Visto che il 90% delle vostre rime parlano di gioielli e
Gesù Cristo, amico, quante volte
Qualcuno vorrà farsi la mia troia? (fatti la mia scopamica!)
Non vedrete mai un Em ingioiellato
Ma talmente freddo che non appena prendo il M-I-C
Polarizzo merda, tanto che il Tamigi potrebbe congelarsi
Ed il vostro cranio potrebbe spaccarsi in due come se vi fossi passato sopra
Stronzo, faccio venire giù il locale come un manganello  (Sì)
Perché abbassare il volume?
Non è abbastanza alto, no alza il Valium!
Perché non ho idea di come farvi chiudere il becco
Ora che non ha importanza il livello
A cui rappo, scommetto centomila bigliettoni
Ve ne fregherete e sarete tipo, "Amico,come cazzo
La fighetta impazzirà solo perchè il suo album fa schifo
E ora vuole prendersela con noi." (Ooouuu)
Ma la settimana scorsa, un ex-fan mi ha spedito una copia
Del Mathers LP per dirmi di studiarlo
Mi aiuterà a ritornare me stesso e mi amerà (Oooouuu)
Ho risposto alla puttana e ho detto che se avessi fatto così
Sarei semplicemente come tutti gli altri nella fottuta industria
Specialmente una fottuta copia di me ai tempi di recovery (NFing)
Quindi sfondare una fica con le dita, alette di pollo, MGK, Iggy ‘zae
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitano Lil Wayne
Dovrei dare addosso a tutti in questo business, scegli un nome
Mi sono stufato di essere umile
Ho sentito che volete brontolare come uno stomaco vuoto
Ho sentito i vostri borbottii, ma è tutto un miscuglio senza senso
L’era da cui provengo vi sfonderà di pugni, questo è ciò che accadrà
Che cazzo farete quando arriverà?
Vi sbriciolerò e poi mi farò una cagata
E ve la lancerò addosso, a meno che non siate Joyner
Kendrick o Cole o Sea siete finiti
Sto per portarlo a tutti quelli che lo vogliono in questo game
Immagino che quando andate da BK vi aspettate di trovare un Whopper
Potete ordinare un Quarter Pounder quando andate da McDonald’s
Ma se state cercando una bistecca è meglio che prendiate Revival
Ma vi comportate tutti come se provassi a servirvi un mini-hamburger
Forse le vocals dovevano avere l'auto-tune e in quel caso le avreste comprate
Ma dire che non ho più abilità
Perchè vi siete persi un verso e non lo avete mai capito
Perchè è andato oltre le vostre teste, perchè siete troppo stupidi per arrivarci
Perchè siete mentalmente ritardati, ma fate finta di essere i più svegli
Con la vostra esperienza e conoscenza, ma non sarete mai artisti
E sono più duro con me stesso di quanto lo potreste essere a prescindere
Quello che non sarò mai è perfetto, tutto ciò che sarò è onesto
Anche quando non ci sarò più diranno che l'ho portato
Anche quando raggiungerò i quaranta come un cazzo di alcolista
Con una bottiglia di malt liquor
Ma non potevo più sopportare questa merda
Il fatto che so che finirò a fondo
Se non mi tiro fuori dalla morsa della sconfitta e mi rialzo in piedi
Non capisco nemmeno perché voi tutti abbiate cominciato a prendervela con me
Finisco nei beef, i miei nemici muoiono
Non cesso il fuoco almeno fino a che non sono tutti morti
Sono dell’eastside, mai fatto beccare quando sono rilassato
Ora capite perché non dormo, non abbasso nemmeno le palpebre, non batto ciglio
Non mi stanco, manco annuisco ai beat
Nemmeno chiudo i miei fottuti occhi quando starnutisco
“Dai, amico! La tua performance al BET cypher era debole, era spazzatura
La Cosa non è nemmeno arancione – o mio Dio, hai esagerato!”
Urlo a tutti i daltonici
Tutti e ognuno di voi, se dite che un camion dei pompieri è color acquamarina
O pensate che l’acqua sia rosa
“Amico, quello è un dattero.” “A me sembra un'oliva.”
“Guarda, quella è una mela!” “No, non lo è, è una pesca!”
Quindi ancora, sfondare una fica con le dita, Pootie Tang
Burger Kang, Gucci Gang, cacca, diamine
Charlamagne odierà comunque, non importa cosa dico
Dammi il Donkey of the day
Che bel modo di cominciare per questo 2018
Ma dirò tutto quello che voglio dire
Benvenuti al mattatoio, stronzi! (yeah)
Invitali come una One a Day
Non ho finito (ben detto)
Perché mi sento come una bestia da soma
Quella riga nella sabbia , ne valeva la pena?
Perché il modo in cui vedo la gente voltarmi le spalle
La fa sembrare inutile, sta perdendo il suo scopo
Vedo la mia fan base farsi in tre parti
E stavo solo provando a fare la cosa giusta, ma gira voce
Che il giudizio dell’opinione pubblica è arrivato ad un verdetto
Oppure deve ancora essere determinato?
Perché sono determinato ad essere me stesso, criticato o venerato
Ma se potessi tornare in dietro, almeno l’avrei detto in un altro modo
Avrei detto che empatizzo con quelle persone cui questo serpente malvagio
Ha venduto quel sogno che ha disertato
Comunque penso che vada bene così
Questi miei versi lo stanno rendendo un pochino nervoso
Ed è troppo spaventato per rispondermi a parole
Perché sa che sarebbe liricamente assassinato
Ma almeno so che le ha sentite
Perché Agente Arancione ha appena mandato i Servizi Segreti
Ad incontrarmi per vedere se davvero penso di fargli del male
O se sono collegato ai terroristi
Io ho risposto, “solo quando si ha a che fare con l’inchiostro e con i liricisti”
Ma la mia specialità sono più i giornalisti dei media
(aspetta, aspetta, aspetta…)
Ho detto che la mia carne è più succosa, un giornalista
Può avere un bel boccone di carne
E sì, intendo prendere in bocca un cazzo
Perché loro hanno insultato a morteil mio album
Quindi ho mostrato il dito medio ai media
Non voglio trasformare il tutto in una seduta terapeutica
Ma mi hanno messo sotto torchio
Quindi non la faccio finita con la stampa
E faccio a pezzi questo beat



[Intro]
It's all bad now, man, it's all bad
But y'all done fucked up now
Yeah! Haha! New shit!
Ayo, I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it

[Verse]
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, ‘cause you last
And you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in
The Source was like our only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas
Or Benzino—shit, I don't even think you realize
You're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably ‘cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit, I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
*Spit* Fuck a relationship! We through!
No more Source to street credit, them days is dead
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays's head
Every issue there's an eight-page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin' waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So, listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
You motherfuckin' punk!
Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
I ain't mad, I feel bad, here's an ad
Here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit
That you don't know about, yeah?
Let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
I'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
Bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me on your TV
‘Cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the morning
To see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yeah
So, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzino's wack; no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack
You're better off tryin' to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin' and bossin' Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him, and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, ‘cause I would have never said shit if you'd
Have kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it, Clue! Spit it, Slay! New shit, Exclusive
Yo, Lantern, yo Whoo Kid
You know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who you callin' a bitch, bitch? You owe me!



[Chorus: Eminem]
It's… (It's…) be… (be…) …cause (…cause) of… (of…)
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do
It's because of these drugs that I do that make me
Do these things that I do, do these things that I do
Be… cause… of…
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do

[Spoken: Eminem]
It was like, "Whoa…"
And then the fucking room started spinnin' and shit
And my friend came in; he was like, "Yo, yo! Em, Em! You puttin' that shit up your nose again?”
And I was like, "Nah", nuttin', like, everything was just spinnin'
I couldn't even see, and like, he started to look like a monster and shit
Then I just started laughin' and threw up all over the fuckin' floor
It's crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin' to it
It's got the power to get you to do it (Come on!)
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfucking kid get stomped (Aaahhh!)
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
'Cause times like these, got me doin' lines like these
Plus, I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs; Shady does what he does
And is what it is; I'm dizzy, Bizzy, visit these kids

[Verse 2: Bizarre & (Eminem)]
Hey, Stephanie (Hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (Okay!)
Now pull your pants down, bitch, and have sex with this dog next to me (Huh?)
‘Til I'm dead I'm takin' blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
That I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Cussin' out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin' 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
'Cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (Uuuuhhhh!)
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smokin' a half a pound
Fuckin' the engineer's wife, while he's mixin' my song down

[Chorus: Eminem]
It's… (It's…) be… (be…) …cause (…cause) of… (of…)
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do
It's because of these drugs that I do that make me
Do these things that I do, do these things that I do
Be… cause… of…
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do

[Spoken: Eminem]
It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy; I was like, out of control
And… just was fuckin' wasted every night, like
Wakin' up the next morning like, "Where the—"
"Where the fuck am I at? What the fuck is goin' on?"
You know what I'm sayin'? I was just like, out of control

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay & (Bizarre)]
These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowin' Anacins, standin' over my bannister
Laughin' with a chromed out caliber (Ha ha ha ha ha ha…)
The weed that I'm sellin' is black, look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashin' it, after framin' a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous; drugs been ran for months
Crackin' capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm lookin' like a extra on "Night of the Living Dead"
Until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything; bitch, you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin' up banks like Uncle Fester

[Verse 4: Proof & (Eminem)]
Aaaahhhh…
Watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-O spleen, and see yellow rings (Ooohhh…)
Blue pills and purple mushrooms
(Hey, little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
Missin' since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See, I'm on Judgment Day, numb from Special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin' the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
While D12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach linin', drown in my vomit

[Chorus: Eminem]
It's… (It's…) be… (be…) …cause (…cause) of… (of…)
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do
It's because of these drugs that I do that make me
Do these things that I do, do these things that I do
Be… cause… of…
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do
Be… cause… of…
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do
It's because of these drugs that I do that make me
Do these things that I do, do these things that I do
Be… cause… of…
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do
Be… cause… of…
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I like, I always tell people, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like, if you got an addiction, don't admit it, to nobody, you know what I'm sayin'?
Keep that shit to yourself, because if anybody sees that, you know what I'm sayin'?
When you're out in the public eye and shit, they're always gonna think that you're on that shit, even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, you know what I'm sayin'?
But, I mean, like, for me, I don't give a fuck; I'll probably end up dyin' from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like, "Eminem dies from drug overdose"
You know what I'm sayin'? And—
And my friends, they ain't no fuckin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
They ain't nothin' but influences, bad influences to me, so
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to, and… I give in to it, so do they



Who the fuck wanna get it on? [pig squealing]
Get shitted on, ten minutes long [loud chainsaw]
Oh fuck! [various violent butchering]
Get shitted on, ten minutes long
A few minutes featured, then they gone

[gradually fades to a live performance]

Fuck rap, I'm not dealin with it
I carve kindness on a bullet, and kill you with it
Your mom's a slut [mic gets cut off, weapons sound]
[people screaming as a chainsaw revs up]
[gunshot]

What is an emcee?
An emcee, is a soldier
Who never backs down from any challenge
From any cypher
Well this is the title that was given to us
Slaughterhouse - no fake emcees allowed

[Eminem]
I fucking hate you, I can't stand you
I'll rip your titties off, and them, I'll hand you
You're ugly, you won't hug me, you're dumb, you're stupid
I'm fat, lazy and crazy, you think I'm Shady?
I am Shady, you stupid bitch
Take your silicone implants, now you gotta Slim chance of
Fuckin' with me ever again
I got your silicone, you can't fuck with me
But I'm still alone, in my cell, mad as hell
Might as well give you some more shit to sell
Fuck!



[Intro]
It's the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot… oh yeah

[Verse]
That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
I'ma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time **** talks
She gets her mou— ahh, I'ma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for shit to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up
And fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to givin' a shit, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to havin' the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the fuckin' nuts like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his fuckin' rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he cannot withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
Fuck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin', "Drain the swamp!"
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in–
–stead of talkin' Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignorin' our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryna use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, "You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!"
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespectin' the military
Fuck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch!
"He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!"
"He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!"
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm usin' all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
Fuck you!
The rest of America, stand up!
We love our military, and we love our country
But we fuckin' hate Trump!



Like
Lemme take it back to 97, the year that most of this started
Grew up in Barnet, North London where my heart is
Man wanna know why I'm heartless
Grew up in the worst way, couldn’t have cake on my birthday
Yeah we couldn't afford the simplest things, we all can rap
The difference is, I work so hard
Cah I need to blow, I know pressure

I know pain, I know real life struggle, been living it everyday
And ask me bout the time I nearly died in a car crash
Outside my primary school when I was just age 11
And the doctors said that I wouldn't ever make it, but I
Came back from the jaws of death
Spoke to god, who said I’m born to reach greatness

See my dad had to duck from the feds cah the poor guy couldn't get his visa
One day they came home, they took him
Then they put him in jail and then they wouldn't let him meet us
It was around this time that we found out my grandad was ill
Got a phone call, straight from my uncle
Saying he was dying and I was wishing he was lying, but he wasn't

See my grandad was living abroad, we couldn't afford to all go see him
Been a fucked up ting but we couldn't all meet him
We had to send dad, luckily they freed him
But the funny ting is that his freedom was a waste
Cah he got there but he got there too late
See my grandad passed away the previous day (then what)

Then my dad came back and he kept his freedom
But he didn't have much and he worked so hard and made sure we were eating
So we started saving, everything was going okay
Over the years we saved 20 bags then thieves broken in and it all got taken

Mans heartless like Ansem
And I know what it's like, when you have nobody wanting to help
But you wanna get the grands up
Man changed when my Nan got cancer
Cah I watched her go through the chemo, what I mean bro is a brand new me
I seen the mad tings that my Nan had to go through
Had opps like she was a gangster

True say, real talk and honestly, I’ve seen death like so many times that it no longer scares me
Working way too hard so I couldn’t give a fuck if a gyal wanna air me
Cah me I don't chase no girls, cah the last one left and left my broken
Left my wounds open, wishing you the best, you left my heart frozen

And I had to learn how to deal with demons
Niyaz, Asheeq, Trinity that’s bros
Helped when I was low
Helped when I was broke
Any ting thats mine is yours when I blow
And shouts out to Patrick, Soj as well
My day 1s in this music business
Don't watch me, just mind your own business
Anybody step in to my way'll be a victim

Come on then, blud come on then try me
Don't brag cos your watch says ice g
You wanna know what cold looks like
You can step in to my shoes, take a look into my eyes g
Right now man are savage with the grind
Lost some friends that said they would have my back till the end of time
We don’t even speak no more, I hope you're doing fine

One day I'm gonna make it
And one day I might get why all this pain had to come my way for me to be famous
Tell mum don't worry bout the bailiffs
I've seen real life stress, thank God now I'm feeling bless
I don't mean to be heartless
But these days man I got to use heart, less



[Intro: 2Pac Talking]
I wanted to bring back that reality
But nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga
That's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions
Cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size

Watch this uppercut, here it comes..
Watch the jab nigga...ugh...here it come
Look out, watch my arms..

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Commin' equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you ho niggas
Run up on me and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why? Stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time
And its a bitch cause the judge gave you 8 years
You doin 6 and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over turned snitch like a bitch

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
They got a nigga in the dice game
I'm feelin' lucky but the nigga just a little bigger
He tryin fuck me out my cash, I'ma blast nigga
He don't know I gotta tell ya like the last nigga
Gotta go don't need to roll for the truck, I get 'em up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit 'em up
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't puttin down my Glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
I'ma show you not to ever play a true nigga (haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin motherfucker we can do this

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

[Verse 3: E.D.I. and Young Noble of the Outlawz]
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent
Roll on our enemies, beat 'em at they own game
Molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if I'ma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let em'
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em'
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret em'
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends and the felons
We all lost souls tryna find our way to heaven

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

[Outro: E.D.I. Talking]
To all the comrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
'Til we get up there with y'all, YOU KNOW!
Thug Life we still livin it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go!



[Intro: Eminem]
Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Is 'cause you denied seeing me
Now I'm pissed off

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sit back, homie, relax, in fact grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wildin' out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio
Session down and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do; Mariah it ever occurred to you
That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for something
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurlin'
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curlin'
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me
I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say "whore", Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time
For no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, I blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got
Includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot

[Interlude: Mariah Carey]
Slim Shady, artful dodger
Slim Shady, artful dodger

[Verse 2: Eminem (& Mariah Carey)]
(I love you) I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said (I want you)
Now should I keep goin' or should we call truce?
(You think you're cute, right?) You bet your sweet ass I do
(I'm Mary Poppins, baby) And I'm Superman, ooh
(Mary P; Slim Shady) Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my (Baby girl)
Then I'll still be your (Superhero)
(Oh and Em?) Yeah, I'm right here
(You like this) Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a (knife) when I tell you get a (life)
But I'm movin' on with mine, Nick, 'cause that's your (wife)
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't (stick to the script) then I'ma just keep goin'
Damn

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife



[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changin', young niggas is agin'
Becoming OGs in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

[Chorus: Eminem & Knoc-turn'al]
'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life and I ain't leavin', I like breathin'
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes (The watcher)

[Chorus: Eminem & Knoc-turn'al]
'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us, now callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just having fun just watchin' it fly by (The watcher)

[Chorus: Eminem & Knoc-turn'al]
'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

[Outro: Knock-Turn'al]
The watcher
I'm watching
The watcher
The watcher



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knifes, I like those
I might just O.D. by the end of tonight's show
With the right dose I might wipe out this light pole
But, the strangest things can happen from jabbin'
Pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
Gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets
I seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Versace "Whoa, hey!" Liberace "ho!" (echoes)
I might have bashed of somebody you probably know
Buncha' faggots in your clique screamin' "It's not me! No!"
Drag 'em out the closet and across the floor
Went you paid 'em a visit in the hospital
Stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils with a popsicle
Stick, and sit back and watch 'em choke

Cause every chair that I throw
People sue me for dough
They press charges on me
Till I can’t fight anymore
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
So I suggest you stay home

Ha ha
Son of a bitch "what, what, what, what, what, what"
Slim Shady, album May 23rd
Dr. Dre

(Imitating Dr. Dre)
Damn bitches, I just took some ecstasy
I'm an extraterrestrial lesbian with a...
Ha ha

Cut that shit off, I'm outta here, peace



Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming OGs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rapping
When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

[Hook: Eminem & Knock-Turn'al]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played, the best to emerge in the game is the Watcher

[Hook: Eminem & Knock-Turn'al]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
And uh, I started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
Listenin' to the radio, wishin' that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
Listen, I got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
Hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, "Have a heart" — fuck they feelings
I've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers, haha
Niggas talk a lot of non-shit I choose to ignore it
A war? They ain't ready for it haha

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained

People I used to know just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch, bitch!"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Haha, watch me clown, give me lovin' when I'm high
I'm a outlaw baby, I'll be thuggin' 'til I die
In my drop-top, double-R, life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend 'til they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watchin niggas out of sight, in my night scope
Cookin' white dope, got my nigga 25-to-life stressed out
Tryin' to have all the better things in life
While Makaveli — a born leader, 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heed, from out the Bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the Earth and the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's alright
I'm in the studio makin' music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated 'til the death
Tryin' to beat me out my last breath
Whatcha gonna do?

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)



[Segue from "Steve Berman (Skit)"]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Hook 1: Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,"
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don’t mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Kruegar
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cause...

[Hook 2: Eminem & B.o.B]
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
With the soul of a Shaman
I'll eat a beat then vomit
Like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It’s probably got diseases on it
I’m just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I'm diarrhea on the track so it needs plunging
Somebody please tell these girls to release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin’ back watching Earth from my Space station

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a muthafucking icicle i'm a nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
(He can’t say whore)
Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny then murdered her
While he danced around the room and wore her panties

[Hook 1]



[Intro]
Hey look let me tell y'all somethin' alright?
What I do, I do. Straight like that
So ain't no sense in y'all troublin' yourselves over that
Cause man the way I feel right now today

[Verse 1]
I came up on the wrong side of the fence
I gave my family pain and strife and asked them all for strength
But hell in my defense
And I got too much way too fast
My mama told me it won't last
Now I'm back down on the bottom
Wishin' that I took another path
I should've listened, but my mind was gone
My temper too quick so when my fuse get lit
So when it's on, it's on
Yeah, everybody wrong
Yeah, and I'm always right
Yeah, ain't nobody to blame now
It's me vs. me, man, this my fight

[Hook]
So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better

[Post-Hook]
Yeah I put that on my family, all you gotta do is give me the chance
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner, back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner, gotta get out

[Verse 2]
You think I got none but I got all kind of sense
Stop judgin' my book by the cover
Maybe you should do a little reconnaissance
I ain't tryna vent, this ain't woe is me
It's nothing owed to me
Get the swan song, I don't need an ode to me
Shit hopefully holdin' this rosary'll keep me out of close calls with the O police
I said I'm tryna be a whole new me
I ain't tryna do the same old thing
I'm tryna prove to my family that I will not bring
No more trouble around, I ain't gotta do nothing
But stay out of shit, I ain't gotta be up in the chaotic
Prolly cause it's my redemption that I'm entrenched in
And I won't let anybody deny my vision, it's my decision
But y'all ain't listenin'

[Hook]
So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better

[Post-Hook]
Yeah I put that on my family, all you gotta do is give me the chance
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner, back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner, gotta get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner

[Verse 3]
It's my gameplan now
To get in this ring and show that I'm a changed man and how
I won't blow another chance to make you proud
Even though you got the right to hate me now
I know you lost your hope in me
But hopefully I can restore it back where it's supposed to be
I just want my daughter back, this fight means much more than that
I'm tryna think before I react, I ain't get the message at first
I tried to ignore the facts
But I'm much older, she's my soldier, I told you I'd go to war for that
I said your boy is the truth and it's no lie in him
All he needs is his family with him
Y'all want him 'til it's no room given
I'ma hit him 'til the ref come and get him

[Hook]
So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better

Lies in the game, how I entertain
The last lines of the next Kurt Cobain
Standin in the mirror with a .9 at my brain
Most rap guys wanna die for the fame
Supposed to die young cause, I'm in the gang
And I can't change cause, I entertain
Can sniff three verses through lines of 'caine
You just realized that, I'm insane
I'm enraged, engaged in a war with ways
They can have me spray shots off the stage
If I die like Malcolm will you feel my pain?
Or just cry like a bitch while I lay in my grave?
If I die like 'Pac, cause I yearn to bang
You discredit me, like I never learned a thang
If I die like Big would you praise my rhymes?
And give me the spot, "Best of All Time"
If I die in N.Y. will the West Coast ride
And the beef not stop 'til, hip-hop die
Will a nigga who don't, understand that line
Try and damage my safety, in N.Y.?
Will the rap game embrace me cause I got skill?
Or for the lies of that man, will I get killed nigga?

[Hook: Ca$his]
I'm just gettin high, gettin high
Think of suicide, suicide
I'm just gettin high, gettin high
Think of suicide, suicide
I'm just gettin high, gettin high
I think of suicide, suicide

[Ca$his]
Will the crimes of my youth, come back to haunt me?
By the time I shoot, will my father want me?
When I tour will my girl be-come a whore?
And I come back home and can't fuck her raw
If I walked on stage like, "FUCK the law!"
Will the hip-hop cops try and kill my squad?
Will the niggas on my team really ride like they say?
Or push me in the shots, he gon' die anyway
Is niggas really jealous, cause I got shine?
Is it envy from the fellas, cause I got signed?
Will the whole hood hate, cause I speak my mind?
Will I die for a rhyme before I reach my prime?
If I kill my bitch like Robert Blake
Do I got enough money, to beat the case?
If I crash out, right before I end the race
And die, 'fore I come out, would you feel my pain?
I'm almost to a point, where I can't be saved
My mindstate, at a place, where it can't be changed
Laws got a nigga stuck like he can't get break
But I gotta back up, all the shit I say
It's lies in the game, how I entertain
The last lines of the next Kurt Cobain
Standin in the mirror with a .9 at my brain
Most rap guys wanna die for the fame

[Hook: Ca$his]
I'm just gettin high, gettin high
Think of suicide, suicide
I'm just gettin high, gettin high
Think of suicide, suicide
I'm just gettin high, gettin high
I think of suicide, suicide

Try us we'll bury ya, bury ya, wasted
Standing on couches, everybody know me
Rock star, only thing that's left to do is O.D

Back on my money got wings on it, fat
Booties got my ding-a-ling on it, clap
Clap, clap, make that butt applaud
You got all that back, what you frontin' for?
Bitches, bitches, this is y'alls song
I got riches itching sitting in y'all thong
We're the business, this is Slaughterhouse baby
This is what it's all about, crazy, money
Blowing in the breeze like
Like a picture pose, I got cheese like
Come, come, get this money from me, I don't want it, honey

Climb the pole to the top of that bitch

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Yeah, bitch, damn right, I'm piping a lesbian stripper
In a Dodge Sprinter; Dick Van Dyke
Whores gonna love it when I go Warren Buffett
Throwing euros on the floor balling on a foreign budget
Slaughter's in the house, look at the clique, that clique
Deeper than the breathes of a fat chick, fat chick
Party in VIP with the Earth's realest
On blue boys and 'shrooms, now the club is Smurf Village
Throwing money in the air like
I'm yelling I'm falsetto like
I know you killers hold the metal tight
Who give a fuck? We all ghetto, right?
I had a lap dance, moment of clarity
This a tax write-off, this is my favorite charity

[Interlude 1]

You see me throw it away

[Interlude 2]

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Tell her she could crash here, hit and run, hit and run
Hop off that pole, get on a different one, different one
I told her do that thing I like and she ain't do it
That was my bad, thinking that she ain't stupid
Cute face with a pretty butt, pretty butt
Shake got a nigga saying giddy-up, giddy-up
Throwing Diddy bucks, put it down, that's a pick me up
Money too long for me to try to titty fuck
Car murder like
Even got the valet workers like
You scratch that, and it's one thing
Cause I fuck around and you gonna hear the guns sing
Red bottoms hopping out the coupe
We got it tied up, even when we got it out of the loop
I tell 'em

[Interlude 1]

[Hook]
And throw it away
And throw it away
And throw it away
I like to throw it away
And throw it away
You see me throw it away
Racks stacked up, get it up and throw it away

So why would I wanna break shit down for you
Better me confuse with the punchlines and bars that I launch
Here the king of debauchery come, with a cracker dick
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one
You must be barely the one billionth
Really you kidding, bitch I'm the prodigal son
And I'm stunting like my Daddy
D-dr-d-drinking like my Mama
C-c-country like my uncles
Stuttering like a CD in a donk
BUMP, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP
And I'm in a blue Chevy
Running over motherfuckers in first
I ain't even shift gears yet
I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth
Right, yeah ho
But I just hit the surface
And I'm bout to walk into a bank
With a shank and a black can of paint to check the clerk
Where the keys
Bitch you better check your purse
I gotta brick of herb
And I hit the syrup
And I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb
So get the fuck outta my way buddy
You don't wanna run around the chicken house with a heart of a puppy dog
Yelawolf and Eminem shit
Sufferin' succotash, yeah suck a dick bitch

[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talking loud but you ain't saying shit
Get the fuck from round here, you don't rep my shit

You don't want that drama, you ain't ready for it, bitch
Now throw it up, yeah, ho, throw it up
Throw it up, yeah, ho, you ain't ready for it, bitch
Throw it up, yeah, ho, throw it up, throw it up

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Bitch please you don't wanna step up to this Misses

You'll make me hurt one of your feelings
Ha ha ha ha
Nah nah ni nah nah
Pick your face up off the floor
I got you feeling sad now
You be on that Hokiewag, Hokiewag is bullshit
Run into this Gangsta, have your preacher at the pulpit bitch
I was born on the Mississippi River
Take no shit from a bitch or a nigga
So, so crazy gotta fucked up temper
Bi-pola', not Nicki I'm worser, I'll hurt ya

Ma nigga, I'm a lion, untamed
Hunt ya ass down in my jungle, I do this

[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talking loud but you ain't saying shit

Throw it up, yeah, ho, throw it up, throw it up
You ain't ready for it, bitch

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Me and Yelawolf
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
You ain't got the umph
You're a hoof to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent
That's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kicking my seat
And I'm trying to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole
When I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation
Throw it back in her face and
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper
That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut, ho
Skidda dee da da
Prada, not a chance
I was thinking about buying you some clothes
But Target's closed
So I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought
Great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know
They didn't carry a size eight in hoes
Oh, this is ugly boy swag
Putting toe tags on you motherfucking ho bags
What a Trailer Trash pioneer
I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you
So we don't gotta scream at you
Ow, I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell em all to go get fucked
But I'm never gonna bite my tongue
Little bitch, throw it up

[Outro: Yelawolf + Eminem]

What the fuck is this, White dog
Yo
Yo, what' up?
What' up?
Uh, you do that verse?
Yeah, I just killed that shit
What?
Nah, nothin'. Urm, yo, you know what I was thinking, man?
I think the one thing that er... that the album don't have
That might be missing
Is like er... a song for, like, for girls
Uh, what do you mean? For like bitches?
Nah, girls. Like a love song
No?!
We need one!
Like—love song, love song?
Yeah, man, bitches like love songs!



[Intro: Eminem]
Right about now
You're about to be possessed
By the sounds of Slaughterhouse

[Chorus: Eminem]
She strips to get tips
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9" + Eminem + Bad Meets Evil]
They call me, "Nickle Nina," a.k.a. ("Royce!")
A.k.a. ("Throw-That-D"), a player gotta keep a condom on 'cause we play safe, aye
Then I'm taking the condom off 'cause I skeet they face
Then I turn off Jodeci 'cause they say, “Baby, won't you just stay?" but you can’t stay—aye!
It ain't trickin' if you gettin it, if you ain't got that, you ain't ballin’—you mad
They call me, "botox," up in Hermès 'cause I help them get rid of all those bags
(All those bags?) I throw this brick on you, girl
Then I drink up, what's your number? I’mma throw this dick on you, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Yeah, yeah, 'cause the strippers love me and I love them too
My bitch be like, "What am I gon' do witchu?" All I know is that I got a thing for her

[Chorus: Eminem + Royce Da 5'9"]
She strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)

[Verse 2: Crooked I + Eminem]
I’m Crooked I, a.k.a., "Fuck-Your-Girl"
(Throw that D) up-up in the sky, when it come down, say—("Fuck the world!")
These strippers are sprung, my middle initial is R, for Richard
And my nickname's right on the tip of her tongue, the side of her mouth is drippin' with—egg
Uh, I’m drunk right now, stumped right now; tryna figure out how
To get four chicks to sit on one chair—oh, yeah—turn the chair upside down
(Upside down?) I throw this grip on you, girl (Girl)
Talking that handcuff you ain't never coming home, man, finna trip on you, girl (Girl)

[Pre-chorus: Royce Da 5'9" + Crooked I]
(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Baby, you got some incredible skills
I want brain, you want shoes—true love's always head over heels

[Chorus: Eminem + Royce Da 5'9"]
'Cause she strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips (I love you!)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I said, "Yo, yo—
You got me on a string, I'm dangling like a yo-yo
You string me along and leave me hangin', and that's a no-no
In my world, 'cause I'll—I'll throw this dick on you girl."

[Verse 3: Joe Budden + Eminem]
Look—(Throw that D)—they call me, "Joe Butt-In," I be around when them hoes strut in (Throw that D)
This relationship is 50/50—if you meet me halfway, I get the whole nut in
'Cause I’m in town—just one day, now, spin round—get your face out the way
And just when she want an encore, I’m gone, Ma, sorry that I couldn’t stay—aye

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
And they call me, "O-E-double-L Ortiz," a.k.a., "Yaowa"
A.k.a.—nah, nothing, I just got an AK in my jeans, can I spray your flower?
(Spray your flower) I ain't really trying to sit with you, girl
When you finish that spit, let's split, where's your wrist, let me throw this grip on you, girl, girl

[Pre-chorus: Royce Da 5'9" + Joell Ortiz + Joe Budden]
(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Before this night is a blur
Here’s my offer—that shit you did, do that with her
Then both you girls—report right here

[Chorus: Eminem + Royce Da 5'9"]
'Cause she strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips (I love you!)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)



[Intro]
Hahaha, right, thug for life, nigga
Can't you read the signs?

[Verse 1]
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, stuck
Can you picture a middle finger out the window, gettin' fucked
Off liquor; get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sho', black
So be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me, what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki'
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game, like the crack game, I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun
Stuck in, buckin' my motherfuckin' Magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry
Pick a spot to be buried, ‘cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry

[Hook]
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

[Verse 2]
Game thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin' money
But you stuck on these fake bitches
And jealous motherfuckers can't see
That's it's the fame that causes
These stupid bitches to pass the pussy free
So tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me?
A young nigga tryin' to hustle up some G's
You pussy-ass playa hatin' hoes
Freakin' down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows
And you the first motherfucker to jump
To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
Thug motherfuckers don't die
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin' in L.A., still clutchin' on my AK

[Hook]
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

[Outro]
Thug for life, beyatch!
Yeah, nigga, Thug Life
From now until for motherfuckin' forever
Have-nots in this, motherfucker



LYRICS WILL BE ADDED ONCE ALBUM DROPS



[Intro: 2Pac]
Hahahaha, man, you crazy

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Please, ain't nothing left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
‘Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Outro: 2Pac]
Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby
Thugs get lonely too
We ain't gotta go through all this bullshitting ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me



[Intro]
Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfuckin' anthem (hip-hop)
To hip-hop music (anthem)
'Cause I'ma keep doin' hip-hop music
Until the day that I die (Until the motherfuckin' day that I die)
Aight, bitch?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumpin' off rooftops drunk after I do shots
Landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizzas, now I got twelve visas
So tell Jesus that I'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes (over)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I used to be too heavy in that cruising Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
I go to parties bumpin' Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot 'til I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced, ain't it? It tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like Sci-Fi TV, "Fuck ICP, buy my CD!" (Yeah)
That's what I'm screamin' while I'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut
Tellin' bitches, "Let me eat your pussy while I shave you!"
Ain't no shame in my game, I turn the party out
Makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over

[Outro]
Uh (Uh-uh, uh uh-uh, uh uh)
Uh uh-uh uh uh
Ah ah-ah ah ah
Uh uh-uh uh uh
Ah ah-ah ah ah
Uh uh-uh uh uh (Dr. Dre)
Ah ah-ah ah ah
(Slim Shady)
(Outsidaz)



[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Your left, your left, your left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Your left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Your left, your left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Your left, your left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Your left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, your left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Your left, your left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me



[Verse: Crooked I]
When I’m speaking, Long Beach is breathing
You could put your ear to the concrete
And hear my heart beating beneath the streets even
As my every breath deepens
You're standing on my chest that’s the reason
The sidewalk underneath your feet is even
To feel them East Side winds breezing
The broken stoplights flashing, that’s my pulse beating
Ima ghost creeping, and there’s no sleeping
No blinking my eyes no I won’t even
The city’s alive in the cold season
The temperature drops when the thoughts I’m thinking are below freezing
I pneumonia the whole region(You ain't hard)
So you thinking of leaving but nothing can (safeguard)
You from me I can reach you as soon as I (take charge)
Of the weak while they sleep deep in they dreams then I wake 'em and make'em a(braveheart)
Seed at you and I swallow the deceased because my stomach’s a (graveyard)
I eating people and beefing (thank god)
You won’t live in my city, I mean live in my body
Cause I am long beach, plus spitting's my hobby
Super sick skills got me sittin’ on big wheels
Nigga clique still the villain's willing to mix quills
Never switch reels, shits realin' to feel
Women and children’ll get killed when we ill nigga big deal
I’m sending any to sleep when you send me the beef
It’s war paint on my face like an Indian chief
I’m an identity thief I’m only leaving my enemies teeth
A homicide to identify a hideous beast
It’s ironic because I hit 'em with the prettiest piece
The way I did 'em don’t ask me is he deceased?
You niggas is meice (mince meat)
I’m white tee give me a crease
My city’s the beach
I’m dumb flow idiot speech
Strong arm gimme a piece
Long arm plenty of reach
Touch you niggas up from Philly to Greece
You don’t wanna die do you?
Soon as I pull the heat out, bullets’ll drive through you
Slugs love to eat out
The way they knock your meat out is quite a surprise to you
Stay out of a ridaz view is what I would advise to you
Cause this is COB until you kill me
I’m 44 weeks deep you niggas better feel me
FOR REAL G

We got to get the get well cards
Niggas is sick

Motion picture shit
Hahaha!

[Verse / Freestyle]
Now don't think I won't hit you because I'm popular
I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya
Catch you slipping I'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya
You never had a hot gun on ya waist and blood on your shoe
Because a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
Homie, you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me, and I'm not like you
I'm like an animal wit it when I spit it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryin' to play me
One shot is not enough you need at least a Uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start to feeling woozy
I write my life, you write what you see in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me
I find my space at the top, I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spit shells to your convertible
Lotus you notice richer or poor
Hollow steel go through your door, this is war
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back
50 Cent, I know you like that, I know you like that



Hook 1: 2Pac]

Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back

Tech's in the place, everybody get mainy
Punks better cuff your lady, can't nobody tame me
Blame me, for keepin' her runny eyed rainy
Ladies used to hate me, now they comin' out they panties
Girls on the jock (Check), pocket full of socks (Check)
Got a fat knot (Check), somethin' gone squat (Yeah)
Down, puttin' it down, down for the block? (Yes)
Tryin' to be hot, but you flop
Wanna be shot to the top but you not DWAMN!!!
I ain't never seen so much green
Than when I seen when my team hit the scene
It must be a dream, hit the stage, everybody holler
Gettin' throwed, rippin' shows for a bigger dollar
Father, I don’t wanna leave nobody toothless
Cause they greedy in the middle of what I do best
You finna' to see me in the TV with a few guest
We 'bout to bubble baby, get you waterproof vest

[Verse 2: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I got glad bags with enemies, cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessy, so they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick 'em and holla
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For my profit pick my Glock up
I'm bustin' with self-defense, you see
Poppin' nobody got 'em, holla
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Niggas is too through, true to the game
I claim Outlaw riders, we give a fuck what they try, I'm…
‘Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain?
Kick back, lil' nigga, and watch the game

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity

Verse 1 2Pac

Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas, and slug niggas
Am I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I bust, then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky; how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me
Look, bitch: I'll cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
Then, we watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
Bam! Set my plan in mo'
Time to exterminate my foes; I can't stand you hoes
Uh, now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride on our enemies

Hook

Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Tell me why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Blessed with a thug's heart

Verse 2 Eminem

I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as Pac signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, ‘cause I get a lot

Hook

Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Tell me why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Blessed with a thug's heart

Verse 3 2Pac

Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die; say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream "Peace!" after they start some shit
Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep
Nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well
Hell, how many niggas wanna be involved?
See, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies

Hook

Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Tell me why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Blessed with a thug's heart  (x2)



{*alarm clock goes off, door opens, kids playing*}
{*sounds of traffic, gun being loaded, shots fired*}

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
Nobody dead knew they would die before they woke
They probably started off a beautiful day with weed smoke
Out of last night's pussy, the murder that she wrote
Cold sweatin from a nightmare, mind on a C-note
You leave the door with intentions of fulfillin your visions
Constantly sidetracked, thinkin bout who's your man or who isn't
Maybe it's necessary - maybe you're overreactin
Maybe your actual downfall is that ho that you're clappin
Maybe your pillow conversations been controllin the actions
Maybe your homey overheard and never told you what happened
You look behind you when you turn the corner, cause death is promised
You done seen some niggas go before ya, the threats are honest
And with that lingerin in the back of your head
You know it's possible that you won't make it back in your bed
The confusion and jealousy and dishonor'll spin ya
But then none come worse than when that gunpowder's in ya

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
If you my nigga, you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a Benz
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da
If you my nigga, you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo'
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
The smell of marijuana reeks off me
I raise hell 'fore I speak softly, caught in the mix
Put at least a hungred grand on one hand, bought him a 6
Acknowledged the weaknesses that his man taught him to fix
We ain't never left the hood, so we camcorded the trips
I done watched the nigga go from BET to the Bricks, shit
The slanted eyes what the chocolate thai gave me
I'm a bachelor, nigga you ain't knockin my lady
A lot of these niggas been jockin mine lately
And I hope you catch this long nap, rock-a-bye baby
We two brothers, pitched outta different mommas
Close enough to conflict and put the shit behind us
Your baby boy meet the daytime
Oldest watchin and these niggas tryin to get mine
Remember back then the lines in your flat top
Hopin your moms ain't the momma on crack rock

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
If you my nigga, you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a Benz
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da
If you my nigga, you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo'
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da

[Verse Three: Lloyd Banks]
Keep my, mind on my money, and my head to the sky
I never really smile much, if you was here you'd know why
There's frustration and fire if you look in my eye
The media fuckin me up, right hookin my high
Niggas hated on us 'fore the game took us inside
Then they opened they arms wide, took the whoopin and cried
I got a platinum plaque hangin on the wall of my crib
And handsome's one of the things they been callin the kid
They watch you close when you coppin all the VS stones
If you ain't tryin to get it poppin, leave the BS home
I got a saditty broad that gives the best dome
And I'm blowin on some of the finest weed that's grown, homes
You won't know when they gon' dump a slug
But you can tell I'm gettin money from the line out in front the club
My whole click caked up, you can't compare the dough
And if it's only one bitch, then we gon' share the ho

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
If you my nigga, you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a Benz
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da
If you my nigga, you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo'
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da

[Outro]
(If you my nigga you my nigga til the end.. my friend)
{*sounds of children playing*} la da da
(If you my nigga you my nigga til we go.. my niggarole)
.. la da da
{*sounds of door opening, alarm clock going off, harmonica playing*}



[Eminem]
Yo blast me off, Tim, blast me off, son
Blastin' off right now son

PART ONE

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods, the MC
With the Christopher Reeve beef
We started out on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood
I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O
I'm like hello to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like Iron Mike 'cause I bite earlobes

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart till I die
Even after I’m all gone and my ashes fried
Went from an ashy guy class clown as high
To a grown ass man stacking motherfucking pa-per
Runyon Ave.'s the clique , D12's the game
We've been spitting this (shit)
Since we were little bébés
Gaga goo goo nana, nadi do do never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot and leave a nigga's face  lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock-eyed it
When I bust it out off in the crowd, niggas start diving
Greg Louganis went over the bar I ain't lying
Hot Iron lethals not defying a soldier
Runyon Ave. soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than (a nigga) understand the struggle
Apply the street-muscle we've been had to hustle
We've been had to hustle, we've been had to muscle
Apply the street hustle, we've been had to hustle

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight, aight
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin Gratiot til I damn near crash the car
Tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off
Over the bridge into oncoming traffic
Caused a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all
Hopped up holding an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kickin' fire out your ass you little bastard
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdrawal
Dick so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of Plastic Man with a drastic force
And went spastic, put my penis on classic sports

PART TWO

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished, huffing the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothing because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares making the hairs
All on the back of your neck stand
Like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yah, Angela so I command you to start dancing
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, ya gangsta, my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facing a task greater, he's chasing your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
I'm so obnoxious, open hand slap nigga, you with me?
See, you couldn't [?] like Cuba [?]
I swan dive in your bitch pussy, I call her puddin'
She love [?], I love the bitch cooking
Scrap that, you niggas weak like Chuck Nevitt
I fuck bucket [?] Jesus swing reckless
Entrepo-po head honcho, hope you're ready 'fore I pop his ass
Nigga, kickin' through your door
You send goons to do your work
I send goons to mommas in church
I've been a problem since birth
Got a middle finger up her skirt
I don't ask a bitch on a date, I ask her can I fuck her first
See y'all with this Runyon shit
I made something out of nothing, I'm a hustler bitch
I keep a nine tucked burner beside of my hip
Gotta make a hit for any nigga for fifty thousand chips, bitch

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm checking the exposure, a full dose of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and Codeine
I was only supposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink frozen
Myself, self-loathing, 'cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosey
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodelling
Rosey, won't you come out to play
Ain’t no sense, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies 'cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events and then he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will
Do what he feels and still can spin
Straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol - three pills, the Real Slim
Shady's entered the building
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and
Tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's
Will get fricasseed on the grill then

PART THREE

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You wanna start with the hook first
You wanna start with the...oh
I have no idea what I'm doing, I have no idea what I'm doing, but
Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
Live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this uh
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me? I disa-
-ppeared, I was hiding in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and a jump from my skin gushing
Nails into my face that I been pushing
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a
Sucker like a vice grip, my pen put you
In the slaughterhouse 'cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brains on
Hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
I got it figured out now nigga, see
My mind's right, money right
Can't nobody stoppin' how I get it
In hindsight I never shoulda left where  I was livin'
I probably wouldn't be getting pressed by all these women
But then again I wouldn't 'a met the ones that I was diggin'
So now I like to look and talk a lot like
She like Lil Kim and Kim and Serena Williams
Just like my [ ] I'm a regular Charles Dickens
Bitch call me talking about she pregnant
She crazy so I [ ] that ho and left baby
I won't never trust her no shit
Even if she specialize in mouth massaging my testicles
I never trust her, a ho, I, even on the first date
She's basically getting her mouth raped
Then turn around and ask me for a kiss
"No bitch I'm straight"
I've never really been concerned with how my own dick taste

I think I'm about slip on my swag juice, swag juice
I think I'm about to slip on your swag juice

[Eminem]

Oh no! Don't slip on your swag juice!

[Mr. Porter]

Yeah, yeah, I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice!

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
So here's a smidge and a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to figit with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice.  Aright

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there sister
Bound to get you dizzy 'cause he gets as busy as a
Bee baby you could throw a Frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he, he's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick witcha
I want the kiss before I blow this bitch to smitha-
Reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
Ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turn tables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
We'll wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's six o-
Clock in the morning unless you want to get some dessert

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidge and a midget to get your Bridgets, digit
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I said, here's a smidge and a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag, my swag juice

[Epilogue: Eminem]
Ayo, just so everybody knows, that was a hook we made on the way to the radio station and we were trying to get it right;
So we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever;
But, this is what we were trying to like work out before we came here. Especially for Westwood, man! ESPECIALLY for you homie!



[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

[Hook]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right

[Verse 2]
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this; I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' lime lighters
I think we live in era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By usin' a special fusion
Of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it
Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

[Hook]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right

[Verse 3]
Eminem is headed skyward
For those who thought that I would
Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas
And showed you all how wack you was
I meant it as a diss
‘Cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you addin' fuel to the fire; I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical
To my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
Freakin' vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here

[Hook]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right



[Tonya]
Hey! Hey, stop, hey. Please stop, fuck, stop!
Thank God you stopped
Fuck, my fucking OnStar isn't working
I left my fucking phone at home!
God, I've been standing out here for like, an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much. Really, you're a life-saver, uh
What are you doing?
Fucking! Get away from me! What the fuck! Fucking asshole!
Get away from me, you motherfucker! Get away!
Get away, you fucking freak! Get away from me!
Goddammit, fuck! Help me!



[Verse 1: Eminem as Dr. Dre]
My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low, bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though
Ghetto idol I think, but what do I know
Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Dont act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly, Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West Coast, the home of the body-bag
The shotty, the Mag Los Angeles, where the party at
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back so have a cardiac
Started back with the black Raiders starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fuckin' started that
Everyday with this game I'm gettin' smarter at
Sky's the limit so everytime I get on a track

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Guns blaze when I shine
Nigga wish quick, no startin' I'm the shootin' kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick but I ain't got no roof on mine
I drink topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I drink topless, I live topless
Sky’s the limit I’m paid to run the city now

[Verse 2: Nas]
Your skin's your travelin' bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistenin'
Vivid on my skin how many continents I’ve visit then
You could journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shittin' on 'em, ya brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it however you want I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit the grind
My genetic code make-up, murderer by design
On mayan calendar time when night meets day
I’m in a light grey Bugatti like a high-speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger the jump in rope in place
The Muhammad Ali hobbies no pilates tryna keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man’s wife see what these hoes can buy me
Lookin' forward but it’s nice to see the road behind me
Hotel’s a seven star, baguette's glowin'
Keep your lid yet dawg the private jet boeing topless

[Hook]



[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, yeah, no roof
Live life topless, can't nobody stop this

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, this the DR., in charge of saving artists out the ER
Bring them back to life, beats like CPR
Made the westside worldwide, no PR
Gangsta rap god, I'm the end all, be all
California love, from the Bloods to the C-Dogs
The Compton monsters make you wanna cut your MP off
The greatest in the game, haters should be ashamed
For not acknowledging the brain of the west coast king
Brought Chronic to the scene, folded pills in the lean
Now the game full of puppets, look at me: no strings
Again and again I've shown, you seen me
Piss on niggas' egos, ruin they self esteem
Sky the limit, no roof, I can do what you dream
Done it all 'fore you ever did a thing, knamean?
Tees and black jeans, no bling, just bang
Officially deranged, clinically insane
Look Eazy, ain't a damn thing changed, I promise
Still live like we did back with Straight Outta Compton
Taught niggas how to have attitudes on some hood shit
Showed them what to smoke when they were blazing that bullshit
That's why you smell the drug aroma when my record play
Not a blemish on my image, decorated resume
A legendary legacy
All that I was, you'll never be, fuck is y'all telling me?
Forever on top
Face it, you'll never be better than the Doc, ask Pac
Again, I say it's never gon' stop
Face it, you'll never be greater than the Doc, ask Pac

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My motto is live by the bottle, so why is my supply low?
Bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded, but I still reach for the sky, though
Ghetto idol, I think, but what do I know?
Shit, I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Don't act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly, Muhammad Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag

Yeah, Andre is back, so have a cardiac
Started back with the black, Raiders starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fucking started that
Everyday with this game I'm getting smarter at
Sky's the limit so every time I get on the track

[Hook]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
1996, I left it all behind
'Cause I ain't got no roof on mine
I had to jump ship, I double back for my chips
My captain handle my shit
I've never been the losing kind
Grind, I feel it like it's year one
I'm a fool anywhere near square one
But ain't no glass ceilings, I crash through 'em
Ain't no coal spills, I light a match to 'em
Ain't no haters right, just say congrats to him
This is Detox, it's rehab to 'em
I bring it back years later, let it flow through 'em
Putting that Chronic in their systems like I used to do 'em
Respected so it's proven that's what I've been doing
Moving the game like weight and everybody been using
Bitch, it ain't really nothing left to say
You're tuned in to Detox, I am Dr. Dre

[Hook]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)

(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Your skin's your travelling bag of your existence

Vivid on my skin, how many continents I visit then
You can journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shitting on them, your brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it, however you want it, I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit, the grind

Hit a rich man's wife, see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward, but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, Baguette's glowing
Keep your lid, yet dawg, the private jet Boeing, topless

[Hook]



[Hook: Eminem + (T.I.)]
When we touch down, (in the Midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass)
Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana
Mississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state
When we touch down
(Go right from the plane to the Range)
When we touch down
(On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we)
Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby
We 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down

[Verse 1: T.I.]
When we get in town, you know how we gettin' down
Pull up clean, then we hop on out
Snatch all the freaks, then walk on out
I'm livin' what they talking 'bout, shinin' if it dark or not
That one hundred E-X-double R
You'll find that in the parkin' lot
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever, son
Still be on whatever coke, ridin' blowin' heavy smoke
Aye, Em, you better tell them folk, won't hesitate to let 'em go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin' me, I put that beam right on your tater (pow!)
Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous
Try to keep him in a cage, but somehow he keep escapin'
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be takin'
Private planes out to Spain, I keep on flyin', I ain't fakin'
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lyin', you're mistaken
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waitin'

[Hook: T.I. + (Eminem)]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Welcome to the Midwest, yes, where them Detroit playas ball
Like you have no idea, the boy is here
Got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home
And just let 'em loose with the crayons?
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like Frogger
They hoppin' out of the way
Whenever they see Marshall's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin'
But I'm bound to bump into somethin'
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'
The way they tumblin', I gotta do somethin'
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, "Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends."
"This is for the pimps
Listening to Mims, nail polish on the rims."
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal

[Hook: Eminem + (T.I.)]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
From my arrival, until my departure
Guarantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody daughter
Aye, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
Flew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of
It's ironic that the shit that we poppin' makes us psychotic
Then treaten corporate America
That's why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant?
Look what hip-hop done brung us!
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest
For that am I being punished? Why is you so astonished?
Now, I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me
You can tell how they yellin' and screamin' and waiting for me

[Hook: T.I. + (Eminem)]

Touch It, Bring It, Pay It, Watch It
Turn It, Leave It, Stop, Format It
Touch It, Bring It, Pay It, Watch It
Turn It, Leave It, Stop, Format It

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh, now you know who the God be
Back runnin' the city
And you know who the squad
Flipmode
Look see ain't nothin' changed
Back with the remix
With the Queens
(TURN IT UP!)
When you see me in the spot
Better respect each other
Y'all already know where I'm rep
Ain't no reason to check it
And I know that
You ain't messing with me
Just for the record
So instead
I'mma let Mary J. Blige
Come and set it

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
(Get Low Mary)
Maybe you can guess
Who it is
Mary J. Blige, I'm 'bout to
Handle my biz
I'm on my grown woman
Still I rep for the kids
In every hood, and all my peoples
Doin' a bid
(TURN IT UP!)
Now you know
Who's really the Queen, deliver the mail
Seven Hundred Thirty Thousand
First week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch
Lookin' all pale;
While I'm on a yacht, overseas
Doin' my nails

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
(Get Low Digga)
Now he sittin' there, lookin' stuck
He thinkin' cause he spent
A little dough, "I'm 'gon fuck."
If money ain't a thing
I'm sayin' let a chick know;
Type to empty an account
How far you willin' to go?
(TURN IT UP!)
Now he hoppin' on the jet
He ain't wasting no time
Told me all expenses paid
Any place I could find
Hit the islands in the Winter
Trickin' all on his dime
Ain't no alpha in this world
Who is better than mine
They wanna

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
I'm jinglin' baby (Go Ahead 'Mami)
Don't I look charmin'
Put your lips up on me
Kiss it, touch it, good
Yes I wish you would (TURN IT UP!)
You like to see me
When I dip, baby, dip
Don't I look like I got Beyonce's hips
Lookin' like I could be Nia Long
Boy, you smokin' that
Cheech and Chong

[Verse 5: Lloyd Banks]
I know what it feels like
I been gone for a minute
But I'm back
Chinchilla on with a fitted
Everybody talk money
Everybody gon' live it
That bowl of bread smaller
Than the arm
(TURN IT UP!)
And you know I'm doin' my thing
It's blue in the ring
If you had it like this
You probably do it the same
But you won't cause you broke
All you do is complain
After the club, I'mma put a few
In the range and let 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Papoose]
Five boroughs of death
You don't understand
I got New York City
In the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist
And let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world
With a New York Nemesis
(TURN IT UP!)
I got Staten Island on my pinky
Queens on my thumb, dude
The Bronx on my middle
Finger screamin' F you
Rock Ice in Manhattan
So there's the ring finger;
You know I had to keep
Brooklyn on the trigger finger

[Verse 7: DMX]
Swizz is the monster, X is the beast;
Fuckin' with Bus, everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets
I'm tired of talkin' to y'all niggas;
I'm stickin' a fork in y'all niggas
(TURN IT UP!)
When I hit 'em, man
That truck come get 'em, man
Roughed up how I did 'em, man
Ain't no remorse for the corpse, truth is
Can't I.D. the body, nigga toothless

[Hook]

[Verse 8: Eminem]
As I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact, BOOM on the track
Come attack (Shady!) guess who's back?
Everybody in the place take a look at the face
I disappeared without a trace, he's a little high, ain't he?
New year, ooh yeah, who's here, new gear
Full gear, Spookier (AAH! AAH! AAH!)
I'm 'bout to scream at the top of my lungs
And I don't even know why I'm screamin' (AAH! AAH! AAH!)
And I'm screamin' on the wrong part of the song
Bus, you did it again, lets turn it up more
Let's turn it up loud, let 'em know we ain't playin'
And I don't even know what the chorus is sayin'
(Touch It, Bring It, Babe)
Just give me the beat, Bus, with THE BIG BANG!



[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I’m the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don’t want no one else to see
’Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn’t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I’m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me—my friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
But, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, "Screw her!"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)



[Verse: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

[Verse: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, hold up
I don't know what planet I'm on
I'm a king, lil bitch watch the throne
I feel like Bono, I'll chop off your arms (off your arms, yuh)
Steady causing havoc, yeah
Bitch I'm ballin' hard just like a Maverick
Money stretch long lil bitch, like elastic
Now that bitch steady calling me Mr Fantastic, yeah, ayy
Know I keep a ratchet (alright)
If you play, boy I'll turn your ass to ashes, yeah
Automatic, doo, doo, doo, doo, bitch, I'm blasting yeah
Ooh, put you in a casket, yeah
Money stretch long, it's elastic
I don't know what planet I'm on (I'm on Mars)
I'm a king, lil bitch watch the throne
I feel like Bono I'll chop off your arms (yuh)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

[Eminem:]
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious
And enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture
When she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her
In this war
When she gets going, she don't stop
When I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her
It was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton
Of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground
For me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it
When I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

[Verse: Lil Pump]
My lean cost more than your rent, it do
Your momma still live in a tent
Still slanging dope in the 'jects
Me and my grandma take meds
None of this shit be new to me, no
Fucking my teacher, call it 'tutory
Bought some red bottoms, cost hella Gs
Fuck your airline, fuck your company fuck it
Bitch your breath smell like some cigarettes cigarettes
I'd rather fuck a bitch from the projects
They kicked me out the plane off a Percocet
Now Lil Pump flying private jet
Everybody scream, "Fuck WestJet!" (Fuck em)
Lil Pump still sell that meth
Hundred on my wrist sipping on Tech
Fuck a lil bitch, make her pussy wet what?

[Outro: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings



[Intro: Eminem]
Big Proof, rest in peace
Doody, we love you
We just wanna keep makin' you proud

[Verse: Proof & Eminem]
My life is trapped in these lines, that’s why I’m packin' these nines
I gotta rap, I ain’t dyin', that’s in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can’t relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers 'til I’m snappin' my spine
Natural high, gotta focus, on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda, hold up
We nothin' but soldiers, slow up, this gun is loaded, roll up
They beef and we leavin' ‘em coked up
If Slim say it I spray it, if he will it I kill it
We Kilpatrick and Ilitch of Detroit, y'all can feel it
Real as this gun on my waistline, at war we don’t waste time
[Ja, man] he can’t take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got school crap here at the 7, 8, and Dexter
I’m up in Hollis spendin’ dollars, ain’t feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha you flinch
When Proof shoot up that coup and wet your whole clique



[Intro: Proof]
Dirty Harry is dead [x4]
I'm here to announce that Dirty Harry is dead
Now witness the life of his son, or Oil Can Harry, The Boss

[Verse 1: Proof]
My life is trapped in these lines, that's why I'm packin' these nines
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back on my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers til I'm snappin' my spine
Naturally, I gotta focus on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like shoulder
Hold up (We nothin' but soldiers), slow up (This gun is loaded)
Roll up (They beef and we leavin' 'em coked up)
If Slim say it I spray it, if he will it I kill it
We Kilpatrick and Ilitch of Detroit, y'all can feel it
Got this gun on my wasteline, and woah we don't waste time
Ja, man he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got School Craft here at the 7, 8, and Dexter
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha ya flinch
When Proof shoot up they coup, and waste your whole clique
Fuck it who's next on this shit, this is prefrence to bitch
When you preface to stiffen slugs enter your wig
You'll be next to BIG, Pac is destiny kid
Before ya lead get popped, stop testin' me bitch

[Hook: Proof]
Homie you think you tough (what)
Think we won't fuck you up (punk)
Even the innocent get pistol-whipped by this pistol grip (punk)
Talkin' shit you drunk (what)
Think I won't fuck you up (punk)
We both deep, I ain't scared and I don't give a fuck (jump)

[Verse 2: Proof]
I ain't feel no games, homie don't even try
We ain't bowin' down to no one we gon' start a riot (yeah)
Heart of fire, soul of ice, roll the dice, see what you get
No advice, all my life I ain't leavin' in this bitch
I'm a man, more I'm holdin' my ground
To loadin' these rounds, at any call approachin' my ground (blah)
I'm a kid but grimey, nothin' but killas
And behind me, I'm a bully fully cuz your team is tiny
If I was to crush 'em, got to say these Bibles are nothin'
This rifle on clutches to leave you stifled on crutches
I fight for my cousins that ain't even related
Even I stated, not from life I leave you bleedin' and faded
Hatin' made in my nature, I'm clappin' and clackin' your captain
Smackin' faggots and act as a rapper with platinum status, ya livin'
Flappin' 'em slappin' 'em backwards
After these rappers' status
To shatters, knowin' Proof and that Mathers has gathered an army
It's Shady bandatas
After rest the game is won, who in the matters get blamed fast with brain damage
The name that some forgot, D12, it ain't hard to feel, guard ya grill, it's REAL!

[Hook]



[Chorus: Fuzz Scoota]
Trife thieves, we can't be trusted
Steppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches
Trife thieves, we can't be trusted
Steppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores (AHHHH!)
Battle Bizarre and it's just too deadly
Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still couldn't forget me
If I don't get all my fuckin' dough
Y'all gon' see more fights and spits than the Jerry Springer show
'Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
For ten rocks even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
'Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his Polo
I'm the reason niggas come ten deep and end up leavin' solo
(I'm by myself!) Me losin'? Y'all niggas must be buggin
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz' and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard, so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it (eat this)
You need to be immediately treated
While you breathin' and you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
I hop in a Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floatin' around drowned, face down in a boat (damn)
I'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull up
To the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he rides by me at ninety miles an hour
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face
With white out, 'cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

[Verse 3: Fuzz Scoota]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips
Yeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin' clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin' hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jacksons sold
I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin' foes
Telepathically harrasing foes
I know your little sister is fourteen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down Titanic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they askin' fo'
Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show
You passing one blunt bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to keep his head up
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like, "Bitch, come and pick this bitch up"
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

[Chorus: Fuzz Scoota]
Trife thieves, we can't be trusted
Steppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches
Trife thieves, we can't be trusted
Steppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches



[Intro: Fred Durst and Eminem]
Uh
Aiight
Check
Slim, Shady, through the mic kid, Uh
Slim Shady, Oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
From a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I say to the girl, I'm like, "What up, girl? Shut up, girl!"
Then I showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed "bloody murder" so loud everybody heard her
She slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
"Yo, baby, what are you on?"
I looked at 'em both and I was like, "Look
Check this out, toots, I'm lookin' for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week"
And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some
Here comes Fred Durst, "Now Shady, let me get some"

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose, I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick
Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no, he insisted we should go
And before I could drop him, Shady had to clock him
The music stopped, the party stood in shock
I looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

[Hook]
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Turn me loose
You better tell them to come reshingle the roof
‘Cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til I puke
Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sitting at the bar and I'm not being approached
‘Cause Fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
"Yo, Fred, save me some"
I walked to these siamese twins
And asked to have a threesome
I told them two heads are better than one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up, like, "Wait, where are you goin'?!"
Well, three strikes and I'm out
And I just struck out two times in a row (Ow!)
I ain't trying no more, fuck it, I'm chillin'
Did a shot of Jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling

[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started

Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...

[Chorus: Trick Trick]
Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)
Work that shaker (twerk dat, pop that)
Go ahead baby (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Turn around lady (twerk dat, pop that)
Everything on us now (twerk dat, pop that)
Turn down for what now (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Bag it up, turn around now (twerk dat, pop that)
Let me see you drop it down now (twerk-twerk, twerk dat, pop that)

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
Who said gangstas don't do that? Cause they lying
In the back of the pussy club, it's all mine
Getting drenched by the cheese, spend 'em rain and shine
They head to another one, can't decline
What up to the DJ, straight to the back
Ten racks to the waitress, change for all that
Twenty something years old, ass so fat
Them boys in the club, D hats all black
Tops coming off, ass on the floor
Guess ten ain't enough, so I gotta get more
They'll lose their mind if I head to the door
They don't love me, they love the bread I blow
God damn, got em on they hands and they knees
Scratching after scratch like rats for the cheese
I'm a dog, I even got scratch for the fleas
Touch my money you could touch your knees

[Chorus: Trick Trick]
Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)
Work that shaker (twerk dat, pop that)
Go ahead baby (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Turn around lady (twerk dat, pop that)

Turn down for what now (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)

[Bridge: Royce Da 5'9"]
I got a white girl (I got a white girl)
She's a dancer (It's Tricky!)
She do whatever I say, no matter what I ask her
Her action's the answer (Talk to)
Of course she know I got a black girl
Who's also a dancer
Don't talk about your life, don't wanna hear about your bottles and ice
Cause we got Marshall out the house tonight
Stay awake

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’m in VIP with no ID with a pint of Beam
Lightin' cheeba, wylin’ the fuck out like Bieber at nineteen
Or Ice-T in the 90s
Frightening in some Nikes slut, nice D’s
There a slight breeze? Don’t like me? Well then bite me
There might be a better chance of flight 370 turning up than us, bitch (highly unlikely)
Little dyke think ‘cause I’m Libra - you're Pisces, and you’re feisty
That you're like me and you might find that we’re like minded
We ain’t nothing alike Diva, you like sleeves
I'm a wife beater you white tease
Bet you like skiing though right skeez?
The way you’re balancing yourself on the poles
Why don’t you grab this one and Do The Right Thing like Spike Lee?
And look out like you’re sightseeing and invite me in the back and bite me in the (God damn)
Shake that ass and titties Cassidy felt that
Dick so fat it could practically snap her chastity belt strap
Standing all the way back where my hotels at
She actually fell back and landed in someone else lap
And laughed cuz she thought she sat on Pharrell’s hat
(Twerk dat, pop that)

[Chorus: Trick Trick]
Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
Fresh out of damn near everything I had
Lil homie, just grabbed the whole damn bag
I could spend all year, never blow my stacks
Getting white boy wasted, hold my mac
Back to the spot, roll some up
So blown last night I toked some up
Lookers want anything, ain't got enough
In the club without bra's ready to get fucked
They drinking, smoking, touching, rubbing
Rolling, crowd's in love with my thugging
Lick it, taste it, kiss it, suck it
Shit! Tryna see who want fucking
Drop that thong, grab that pole
Bend it over, let me see what I can do with that (OH!)
Stack so big it ain't never gonna fold
All the money I spend, you ain't never gonna close

[Chorus: Trick Trick]
Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)
Work that shaker (twerk dat, pop that)
Go ahead baby (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Eminem)]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But still worst of all is she (he) really don't give a—
(She (he) don't give a shit)

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey & (Eminem)]
Sometimes I wish that you would just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
(How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good, all you are to me, is a

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to

[Hook: Skylar Grey & (Eminem)]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But still worst of all is she (he) really don't give a—

[Verse 3: Yelawolf & Eminem]
Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo—smokin' blow with Antonio
In the back-alley, takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it, uh
Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside
'Cause

[Hook: Skylar Grey & (Eminem)]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But still worst of all is she (he) really don't give a—
(She [he] don't give a shit)

[Outro: Skylar Grey and Eminem]
But maybe I'm the twisted one that screwed this up
So, I guess, this means goodbye, for now, (laughter)



[Intro]
Slim motherfuckin' Shady... alright!
Missy Elliott, Timbo, c'mon, yo!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends
Holding a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tecs at you
Until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' out the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' out the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a buildin'
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (Keep filmin'!)
Woke up to a hospital staff
Got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half
And suffocated your oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'm a get the East and West beefin' again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Interlude]
Ken Kaniff: Oh fuck, oh shit
Ken Kaniff: I got the hotel room ready
Ken Kaniff: What time are you getting off, work
(Ken Kaniff: Or shall I say) Eminem: Aight, yo, yo, yo one more time, yo
(Ken Kaniff: What time are you comin' home)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'm only smilin' when I'm violent
Got on the plane wildin'
Told the pilot to fly me to Tylenol Island
Stewardess like, "You restless?"
"Nah, bitch, I'm restful, so hold this fuckin' jet still so I can eat these pretzels"
Forget school
The other kids are disrespectful
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles
I can't take it
I'm tryin' to gain weight
So I eat steak
And swallow the whole plate
And weigh myself, naked
Put out albums
To teach kids family values
'Cause every mom and dad should allow you to pop valiums
And never hit someone unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason
Make one up, then start swingin'



[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now
Haha

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 1]
Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up!
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
No, it can't be, it can't be—yes, it can be
The fuckin' Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddamn it
Insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk négligée, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me
'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 2]
Six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day (hah!)
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 3]
Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? "Headed off to?" Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Outro]
So, it wasn't a choice, it was "I had to do this."
And now I got 90 days clean
And uh, that's all I have to share, thanks
(Thanks for sharing, Brian
Is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
Yeah, I got something to share:
"When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So, homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down."
Where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay-A
Okay, wait, I got another one
"I just love condoms and lots of cum."
No? Well, shit!



[Hook: Eminem]
Chem-le-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Chem-le-le-le-ne-miah-nuf-niah, ne-nish, ne-ne
Translation:
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
‘Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin'– nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a "Stop the Violence" rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
‘Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, ‘cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', "Kuniva, yo, yo!"
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

[Verse 6: Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Outro: Eminem]
Ha-ha! Suck my motherfuckin' dick!
D12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady



[Intro]
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (When it's on that's who you get, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (That's your motherfucking clique, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (You a motherfucking snitch, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna shine like me (Me)
Rhyme like me (Me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (Me)
They want to do it 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Ayo, you think about shittin' on fifty, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King Davids
I teach niggas sign language, that ain’t deaf, son
[click click] you heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at ya car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It's nothing, I can go after Mase's fan base
Shell hitted my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth [huck-too] spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like "Fiddy, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P. Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

[Verse 2]
Mama said everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk to him I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy 'cause I don't fear man
'Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
32 karats in the cross, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me
I'm the one

[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

[Verse 3]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stay in some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it’s special y'all
A country boy tell 'ya "I’m a finna to blow"
I’m more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I’m in this for the paper, but I don’t love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know 'em little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won’t you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching, you watching me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me? Ha ha

[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me



[Hook: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've got divas sleeping at my house like a lodge
Cause after one massage, I hit them with a barrage of flesh they can't dodge
My garage and driveway are filled with parked cars to the street from visitors who didn't survive me
One night stand of loosey-coochie, dying in my animal house with my neighbors like John Belushi
I talk dirty to nuns until they're horny as Satan, and keep them running back there like Walter Payton
Here ya go, here's my number yo, dial M&M for Murder if you wanna undergo
A hard day's night and we can get on it
I pack a full load, and I do ya like laundry
Cause I believe that all bad girls must get spanked
So come gank the clank, and we'll go clankety-clank
And you'll be permanently added to my collection
So I suggest you feed the dogs in front of the lawn before ya check in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
See, I may be a youngster but baby I can do the pullup for ya
Physically delirious so get your butt over
Cause like Whitney I've been saving all my love for you
So roll out the the great taste of Pepsi, and get ready for Mountain Dew!
Here's a [?] cause looks can be deceiving
If you look into my eyes you'll be perceiving a sexual demon
And don't measure me in just 12 inches, since it's essential to make you suffer a bit, [?]
So let's put our heads together, we'll come up with something
Jimmy Deans are like raw cut, you're cookin', so
Grab the meat, at a place that's dirt cheap [?] for such a delicacy
You'll be royalty to me if there's loyalty to me baby
Yeah maybe I get this sweaty and salty [?]
We'll get in that heavy-duty bucket
I ain't using protection, I ain't Vanilla Ice, I want the satisfaction!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
All I'm asking for is one night
And in the heat of the moment, your pants dropped and I do my best work at night
So after seven I can't stop, once I kiss you you'll be wanting me really bad
And how you feel [?] without the natural aphrodisiac
I'll getcha hot [?] rap
[?] getcha hot [?] graduate [?]
[?]
[?] flooded with anxiety
[?] like "yeah, put it inside of me!"
And once I begin to dig and make that hole twice as big you can't renege
I've got nymphos to where they can't stand sex
Cause I've ended up stretching their muscles like Spandex
Watch 'em squirm like a worm the entire term
Get a firm grip, aim for the eye and shoot sperm!
And all the action got the capability for excitement
But the night ain't done yet, 'till we reach enlightenment
So, yo... do you think you can handle it?

[Hook]



Wow, it's been a few months since we've profiled a creme-de-la-creme MC in need of some nurturing from a record company. During our ninety day hiatus, however, our ever-reliable "Flavortracker 2000" came across a target that, in many ways, redefines the term ill. He goes by the name of Eminem (as in the popular candy). After making a buzz in the Detroit area for quite some time, he just recently gained the hip-hop nation's attention with his impressive showing in events like the Rap Olympics. One glimpse of the contents within his Slim Shady demo, one can't help but recognize that this rapper of the Caucasian persuasion's got skills.

     As far as flow, he keeps it simple, yet extremely effective. In "Murder, Murder," he kicks a humorous tale about a bank heist gone wrong: "Left the keys in the van/ With a gat in each hand/ Went up in Eastland/ Shot a policeman/ Fuck a peace plan/ If citizen bystands/ The shit is my hands/ Here's your life span/ For what your life's worth, this money is twice than/ Grab a couple grand and live in Iceland/ See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan." Another guaranteed rewinder is the semi-demented "Just The Two Of Us," a crazy tale about the actions Eminem takes upon his baby's mother. With wifey placed comfortably in the back of his trunk, Em drives far and wide explaining to his seed the reasons why "daddy had to bury mommy."

     Point blank, this ain't your average cat. This Motor City kid is a one-of-a-kind talent and he's about to blow past the competition, leaving many melted microphones in the dust.



[Hook]
Unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't
I'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box
Until I sit in Heaven I will never stop
I will never stop

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to niggas too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, visions of niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Psssh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It’s like I’m - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked 45, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan

[Hook]
I am unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't
I'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box
Until I sit in Heaven I will never stop
I will never stop

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I got a handgun habit, nigga front I'll let you have it
When the shots go off, cops sayin 50 back at it
I'm allergic to the feathers on these bird-ass niggas
Front and I'll put your brains on that curb fast nigga
I ain't a marksman, one spark and I spray shit
Nuff rounds from that H-K, I don't play bitch
Move like I'm militant, back on that gorilla shit
Moody, disrespectful, unruly, but niggas can't move me
I squeeze till I run out of ammo, if it's a problem it's handled
I have your people pourin' our liquor and lightin' candles
You fuck around I blow your brains on my New York Times
Run home, turn to the sports section and read your mind
It's crystal clear, you should feel when that gat bust
First there's crime scene tape, then you end up in that black hearse
We don't go to funerals, but we'll go to your wake fam
Do your body all banged up, (inaudible) you made a mistake man

[Hook]
I am unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't
I'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box
Until I sit in Heaven I will never stop
I will never stop

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause that's sort of unique cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[Hook]
I am unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't
I'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box
Until I sit in Heaven I will never stop
I will never stop



[Intro]
Nah, man—not quite finished yet
Haha, woo!

[Verse 1]
Girl, I think you just might've tried
To pull a motherfuckin’ fast one, I’m mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade?
Tryna play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway?
Better cooperate or get sauteed
And rotisseried while you’re hog-tied
MC’s get so quiet
You can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin’ Fall Guy
I don’t gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
And run over kids, women, and men—Vrinn-Vrinn!
Motor so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin’?
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it’s gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shit, if I think a penny’s pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he’s tryin' to roll a snowball
But don’t make him lose his cool
If he hollers, better let him go, y’all

[Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
"You don't own me"
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit—yeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it
Evil—I see, hear, and speak it
Lady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin’ chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin’
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in
So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin’
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag’s asshole
Now let’s take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he’s cool with it
Don’t stand there and look stupid at
Me, bitch, I ain’t in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it 'til it pops up
Y’all are so motherfuckin’ full of shit that you're stopped up
Me, I’m always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth
'Til your speakers crap out Pfft, huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt
Like a lit cigarette (chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won’t get a hot fudge sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut, because—

[Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
"You don't own me"
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 3]
And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, it’s time to put the math back into Mathers
'Cause I’m a fuckin’ problem—run, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered
So every last word that you fuckin’ fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words, I’m a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank, yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don’t feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist him now—can you, ho?
“Shady, I don’t understand your flow”
Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu’s hair, boy
Don’t you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I’m raw, you ain’t even medium-rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point
But you can’t touch, I’m too clairvoyant
I don’t get it, man, is there a void?
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I’m back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
And remember, boys—

[Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
"You don't own me"
Now here we go, go, go

[Outro]
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
Until next time;
Peace



Pt. I

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to build

[Chainsaw revving]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got a shit-eating grin
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City, since when did we begin to get dignity?
No diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your figgity-friends
I'm lookin' at your bum-stiggity-bum, hun
The miggity mack's biggity back, don't act wiggity-wack
You can get the figgity-finger: the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit and spiggaty-spin
Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Cîroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I'll call it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit, yeah, that little chick is hot
But if she got rabies I wouldn't give the bitch a shot
I'd poke her in the rear, but I bet if I lick her, she'll try to chase me
(Ha ha!) What are you: pit, rott, mixed?
Oh, you just got fixed, well shit, then let's lip-lock
If not, then trick, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit 'cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
'Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like the shit's sobbin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross
You'll dig this; if not, then kick rocks in flip flops!
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So crank the volume 'til it's bangin' and I'ma keep on sayin'
All the shit I should be hung for and probably killed for sayin'
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like Joplin 'til I drop, and still
If that don’t do the job of killin' Shady, then the karma will
They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done ate away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'
I ain't stoppin' til we explain it
Oh my god, for real, man, not again, I'm shakin'
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until it's—
Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'…
What's it called again? I'm blankin'
The thing above the balls between my legs
And I think that I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait, I think that I got it, okay
Bitch, I got you, Robin Williams hangin'
Bitch, don't hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on, kemosabe, it's past time like your favorite hobby
'Cause of the way that I spit she remains on my dick
Then she grab me by the nuts
And try to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no-brainer
Or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbitt
Gotta weiner off it, wean her off it
Like she took my fucking penis, chopped it
And stuck it up between her armpit
And she begun to swing a karambit knife and paint the carpet
At least that's what her train of thought is
'Cause I came, saw, conquered it
Hit it, quit it, and made her plain b-bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches a complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you give this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I learned extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Cha-cha-cha
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car!
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick, so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie, so swallow my pride
You're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away, Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle or me?
(Squee!) I love it, love it, love it
'Fore I get lost we're gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now let's hit the highway
And try not to get lost 'til we get to Las Vegas

[Bridge: Eminem]
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas

[Chorus: Eminem]
Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
'Til we get to Las Vegas

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9]
Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room
Like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Lick her like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
And 7 nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas
We roll in circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib wavin'
And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store
With about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down and did an ALS challenge
Haaaan! I stole that adlib from French
Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sittin' on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothin'
Then that shouldn't mean nothin' to you like likes on the 'Gram
If she current, I keep her pussy purrin' like the pipes on a Lamb
Weed got her so chinky-eyed
Look like she been gettin' high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fuckin'
Sound like I'm shakin' up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas
I make you my ex miss if this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listenin' to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
(Bitch, get the fuck out of my face!)
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter
Startin' to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me, I said say, por favor
Thought I said the Wraith had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the 9 like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and yo' friend
The only fear I have is of loathin'
And I won't even kick in 'til we get to Las Vegas

[Bridge: Eminem]
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)
Vegas

[Chorus: Eminem]
Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
'Til we get to Las Vegas



[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)



[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, alright, alright
Uh, Slim Shady, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar, with your skeleton showing
Developin' anorexia, while I'm standin' next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20-percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick so tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

[Outro]
Motherfucker! Slim Shady, bitch!
Recognize, for the '99! Album February 23rd!

(dialing tone)



[Verse 1]
Met a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the forty
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I strapped the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house, killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strappin' more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker!



[Intro]
Its like this and like that and like this (x2)

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners, looking for hookers
To punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr. and smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now



Fuxk vic mensa and vice
I won’t be twice as nice
But I’ll be fine
Once your dead with no shrine
Fuxk the reporting work
It has no real worth
About guys giving birth
You said you beat women
What you teachin children?
Diss people who aren’t livin
You dissed X
Cause he was high on Complex
Think before polling
Bitches just trollin
Dead bodies can’t come back
Luckily we can react
I would knock you out if I see you
But hitting bitches is BAD to do
You should check genius
You are not jesus
Fuxk vice with the fake news
They should pick and choose
They going to lose
Have some shit and no clue
What’s really going on
Telling everyone to hit the bong
Without proper research
Sounds like the church
Don’t even wanna web surf
It will make me shoot, no nerf
Fuxk your path
Because I can
I can take a blood bath
I’m a psychopath
Never will be fan
Someday you will be dead
But noone will be at your deathbed
Also fuxk Jah’s killas
You will never be iller
THERE’s SOMETHING GOING ON
Listen to that song
Vic’s not that strong
What the fuxk you doin’
Now your career is ruined
Poorly you have been choosin
People will see this shit
Credibility you will never get
I’m sorry, I’m just pissed
Suck a dick
You little twit
Drink a fifth or smoke a spliff
Slam your ass in the wall
Who you gonna call?
Ghoste bust
I feel like I must
My hand will thrust
I will cause I have the lust
Freestyle for this diss
Just fuxkin cut your wrist
No one would remines
She just wants a fuxking kiss
From anyone but you
There wasn’t enough proof
You must be smoking boof
She would have been dead
Have you seen his fight moves
She would have died without being fed
Now sit alone and go improve
Fuxking punch you in the face
You would lose this race
No followers on my page
No one can feel my rage
Fuxk Vic mens
He doesn't make sense
Just trying to build suspense
Faker than mike pence
In front of his mother
Never call you my vrother
Just trying to cover
The fact you have no lovers
No one likes your music
Or even heard
Till you dissed X
Now you get the bird
Everyone hates and your ruined your career
Everybody wants to steer clear
Can’t even make a good track
Why are you here?
Just trying to figure out
You just chasing clout
That’s not what you really about
Fuxk vice
Quit would be my advice
Your fuxking articles are shit
Everything not just a little bit
Never wanna go
Should review roller coasters
Or like toasters
You disrespect soldiers
And I wish it was all over
Your brainless ever since
You emerged from the mist
You wanna bet
I have no regret
I’ll take you down on my set
Fuxk it, I’m threw
I hate you too
Take your last breath
Before you get death
People think I’m a nice guy
That I keep my cool
But I hate fools
And they gonna die
Young never sung
Or never sprung
Your too dumb
You guys are such pussies and I wonder why?
You article are fake like AI that is Bi
I spit straight fire
You want everyone to get hired
And vic should fuxking retire
Fuxk you I don’t wanna hear
I’m the headlights and your the deer
At your show I would boo
You can’t even rap as good and me dude
When you fail, no remorse
Going fall of that high horse
Have very little skill
It’s like your on a chill pill
Just doing it for the meal
That's why you're trying to steal
I did this track with such ease
Why don’t you suck these
All the ideas are wack
Hating everyone with a sack
Trying to get back
I wanna attack
The way you fuxkers act
Better get your act right
Don’t too things outta spite
Alright
Drink by the pint
Now lets fight
Your bullshit won’t fly
Wish your one of the kids at columbine
This beef is worse than 6ix 9ine
Not an OG
I hate this bitch high key
Vice covers sexual trees
The facts are so fuxking dumb
It’s like chum is fum
Your not Rolling Stone
Have an empty dome
I think your a hoe, oh no
Maybe I’m just an asshole
But what the fuxk are you doin
Your fuxking in ruins
I’m just bloomin
You all feses
Not hard so no cheese
Fuxk this
Write diss
Fuxk the BET
For giving this guy a seat
You guys are fuxking fake
You fuxking bitch
I guess I have to slit
You with the vic(E) grips



[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo



[Thug] There he go right there, got this nigga. What's up Obie?
*gun fire*
[Obie] Oh shit
*gun fire*
[Thug] Uh, uh, uh nigga. Yeah nigga, shit
*car pulls away*

Obie Trice

[Hook]
You can catch me in the hood, up to no good
With that Mac like right beside me
I ain't by no niggas eyeing my figures
Deprive me of my life, try me
I'mma rip up tissue, homie I won't miss you
This'll be the day that ya dying
Nigga I'm violent
Ya hearing the sirens, once that ass silence
For fucking with me, nigga I'm violent
Cause I'm so tired of these wannabe riders trying to touch Obie
Cause nigga I'm violent

[1st verse]
Hat match the jacket, jack match the glove
Glove match the Mac that send niggas above
All black when his faggot ass acts up
When the boys interrupted haters can't wait to duck
Cause when I buck I leave a peep hole in his face
They peep O in the place then they get a bad taste
In they mouth, running his lip, I pull that ouch off my hip
Commence to spit, I'm too grown for this
But they tend to take you back to when you're known for riff raff
That'll be his ass, fucking with this cat

[Hook]

[2nd verse]
They say O calm ya nerve, but some niggas need to be served
Cause it's purpose is unheard of
Blacks done seen too much murder to flirt with death
Guess he feels it ain't nuthin left
That's when the weapon is taking it's last breath
If he think for a second he taking me outta my flesh
Violent when it comes to putting Obie to rest
Natural cause is the only way they say he left
Not from no hater, I got too many guns
So, when it come to that shit, I'm off one nigga

[Hook]

[3rd verse]
Incapacitating O, no, I'm so
Observational I recognize you ho's
Nocturnal mufuckas knocking ya mans
Cause I'm sitting on paper bigger then Shaq hands
Plus every chance I get Obie advance
From spitting to getting riches, I'm so enhanced
On bitch ass niggas trying to slow my plans
Realest shit a nigga ever spoke to fans
Listen, I'm taking kites in the pen
A nigga ever offend again, and that's on my kid

[Hook]



[Verse: Obie Trice]
They say he was a monster from birth, so
Fuck it, I'll just a lean warn-os them hoes
I suppose O took on the street life
Even though my mother told me I could be otherwise
Wasn't the school type, I was too cool
My agenda wasn't general education, nigga
Generalizing Obie's expectations
It was like, a cucoo in twenty-twos
Bad news my nigga, pass the brew
Cause in a week we be pouring a glass for you
So rapidly homies become causualties
We was just playing Madden
Now a nigga sad for his family, that's how it happens
Dudes get blasted, another casket
Another child becomes a fatherless bastard
Make a nigga wanna grab this rachet
It's so tragic, and Obie can't get past it
And you wonder why a nigga'll flash it
Just to show these demons that I ain't having it
Put 'em beneath the grass in a flash
Homie I'm from the craft
And to make it where I'm at, that's called Soldierism
Real niggas notice em, they wanna flow with 'em
Wanna do major shows with 'em
Get the fuck out the ghetto with 'em
Heavy metal, leave a nigga twisted, don't fret
This is the set we live in
But I ain't crying or whining about my environment
Even though black folk is dying constant
Niggas'll shoot you unconscious
With no conscience, until you lose conscience
Conscious, and pompous white folk think I'm just rhyming
Just designing lines, just for the sake of shining
Like I just speak violent applying to the business I'm in
Rewind and find him in a dirty ass hood with no sight of climbing
Moving on up was just The Jeffersons
Rest of us watching the tube got less then them
So why you vexing him? Why you stretching him out?
He got the weapon all because his whereabouts
Born and raised, mental slaves
And I don't see change before I'm seeing the grave
All I see is my homies corpse decay
Crying at his wake, can't recognize his face
Face it, you not identifying with me
My identity distorts ya visibility
So you can't see me, peep what he's achieving
You recieve information from TV
I'm in the hood, I live it you read about it
Rest in peace Peezy
Please believe Obie eyes've seen The Wire
Prior to what you seeing on the screen
I done been in and out of the bing
Lost niggas to unfortunate things
That's why, praise the Lord I'm still on the scene
Praise the Creator who made human beings
Just for creating a nigga like me
A nigga that put the umph in G, yeah

[Hook: Eminem & Obie Trice] (2X)
(Wake up)
I try to reach out but you won't
(Wake up)
My brothers and sisters, we got to
(Wake up)
'Fore you stuck in the system, and then you
(Wake up)
Reality hits you, before you can
(Wake up)

Previously on Good vs. Evil

[Interlude 4: Eminem]
I live in a world
That's different than your world
Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy

[Interlude 5: RZA]
This is Bobby Digital
Contacting you from cyber space
The puppet master and his minions have penetrated into our dimension
We need you to make a full on attack
His evil dark forces can't be allowed to spread
This is a code red
This is a code red

[Interlude 6: KXNG CROOKED]
I'm here to kill the puppet master

[Interlude 7: Announcer]
The puppet master was destroyed
But there was no time to celebrate
Because a new evil was awakened



[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Six in the morning, don't even know your name
Even though I'm glad that you came, I'm sorry, but (you gotta go)
Instead of tryna parler, why don't you make
Like heaven's having a soiree? The party's up (You gotta go)
No disrespect to you, I just met you, you special but would you (gotta go)
And even though I feel you fly, my incidental bill's too high, sorry
Here, put my number in your phone so we can talk again
That walk to the lobby you got, we call that the walk of shame
I don't know what room Joey's in, or where's your friend
I don't know your friend, no offense but (you gotta go)

[Interlude]
Goodbye, muah

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
It all started when she stuck out her rear
Top bunk of the tour bus, she getting dug out up here
It felt like we could have hung out a year
But I was thinking with my dick, now bitch get the fuck out of here
I'm sorry that I did your girl reckless
I fed her a squirrel breakfast, she left with a pearl necklace
That big old ass had to be felt on
Or else it’s just a waste like the space, I put my belt on
Now tell me what the hell is wrong
Fed with your ex, you get sex and get mailed home
Thugnificant tells em go that way
Then I send that bitch a smiley face (Bitches love a smiley face)

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Cab on speed dial, I ain't with devotion
Ain't buying what you're selling, nah, I ain't drinking the potion
Plan like anything slow motion
But a sweet baby Jesus when the frank's in the ocean
I don't know magic tricks, but you'll see plenty soon
Amazing how good one night stand in this empty room
She got gall, being the noise she had at breakfast
I tell her role play and be a voyeur with the exit
No, you don't get a key to the crib
You can be my wife for a hour get me in your rib but then you (gotta go)
And this party ain't unusual
She's sorry she came, I'm sorry it's not mutual

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Yeah, last night was fun, but that look like the sun
So yeah, last night is done and um (you gotta go)
I know, I'm sad too, don't forget your earrings
Oh, these ain't yours? My bad, but here's your bag, boo (You gotta go)
Your hair looks fine; I swear, your hair looks fine
Plus nobody care, you a dime but look at the time, girl (You gotta go)
I got shit to do but next time I'm in town you got my word
I'mma get with you, now where the fuck is this missing shoe? (You gotta go)
When I go in tour I find me a ho for sure
With open jaws and cute knees that both go on floors
Gina's and Pam's, I ain't tryna be Cole
But in the words of Martin: you ain't gotta go home but

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of (Shame)



[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"



Walk On Water

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?

A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as

Stan

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Love the Way You Lie

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, “Wait!
Where you going?”, “I'm leaving you.” “No, you ain't
Come back!” We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie



[Intro]
Woooo! It's Shady aka the Army Shady Records
Break it down

I do a lotta spittin' and I don't gotta try
But I ain't got rhymes to waste so let's make it
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop something

[Verse 1]
I got a friend of mine, named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now, the deals is finished and it's time
To get down to this business, let's get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop, G-Unit shit before it's gone
Its like a gold mine for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, he gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must be a sign, these labels must be blind
Columbia, I know this must be fucking with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry cause they missed out
But I know how to get the dough cause Dre gave me a business mind
I said in my line, I hit 'em with a nine
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'

[Verse 2]
Damn 50, this shit's about to hit the fan 50
Fuck happened to Ja?
He got the sickest vendetta, he must think that you betta
He bought to play with his paper, you gonna fuck with this chedda
Now homie think we gon' sweat 'em but we just gon' forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll dead'em, let Yayo stomp his head in
It's all good cause we'd rather rap then to let a
Pussy play us outta pocket homie, so tell 'em
He better be easy
Start some bullshit, he'll get his whole crew wet
D-Twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent and G-Unit
Yo, he don't want it cause he's always drugged out
You won't see one picture where his pupils ain't bugged out

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'



Since they wanna know
Since they wanna know
I said since they wanna know
Here's the formula on O, now lets go
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
Second rounds on me
Obie Trice
Emil hit em, let's go

[1st verse]
Ob Trice, the giant, standing a 5'8'' stature
Back with a second album, supplying ya Fear Factor
But Joe ain't the host my nigga, you have the access to the most
Noted flow on Shady's faction
And I ain't being cocky, if so accept my apology
Except, know I process my thoughts logically
First weeks sales tops the toll from tsunami
But haters like to yell it's the white boy behind me
But you couldn't inhale a flow that's more grimey
It would still prevail if another label sign me
Obie so timely, must Obie remind em
The first nigga to shine solo from the place ya find em
Native Detroiter, ghetto reporter, hit you wit some
Heavy metal for supporting wit'cha quarters
A little something different from the homie from Michigan
Basically, Obie's ripping on any instrument he's given, come on

[Hook]
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(End what’s right and why am i immature?)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know

[2nd verse]
Four niggas in a whip
All foes say they ain't fucking with Trice shit
Somebody's lying, I'm undenying, denying me means that
The driver got influence over you on certain things
Be destinguished, just cuz you ain't feeling his favorite emcee
Don't mean you speak no English
Hop out the car, catch the bus
At least you be established as the man that you are
I hate to take it so far and so tedious
But niggas bleed like bitches, I'm truly believing this
Once a month, they wake up with a Obie tampon
Inserted in they nuts, give em the flux cuz my bucks is up
And no this ain't eBay, so please be easy
Gotta be delusional to think Obie is losing yo
Let em get a whiff of some shit, they quick to abuse it though

[Hook]
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(End what’s right and why am i immature?)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know

[3rd verse]
Peep what O's selling when I hit em with Van Halen
But it's just a man from the ghetto rebelling
Rebel without a cause, cause I'm in them Superman drawers
Running around the shack momma had us living
Now ya mans limping a inch from truly killing em
All due to ambition, a gift, given from the man who invented em
When the system Scrooged just like Lil Tim and em
Will bless the child who manuevers the censors, then
Spitting venom, have them same dudes interested in him
My visions unlimited, music's my outlet, I rock a outfit
For all the foul shit I witnessed, make it my business
To get a listener of one, clear description
If you hearing them, you would catch what I'm pitching
Guarantee to serve your addiction, c-c-come on

[Hook]
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know
(End what’s right and why am i immature?)
Since they wanna know
(All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt)
Since they wanna know



[Intro: Eminem]
Woo!!! Yeah!!! Remix!!! (50 Cent: Ha Ha!!!)
Lloyd Banks!!! (Lloyd Banks: Uh Huh!!!) Ha Ha!!!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It’s like a joke, he’s like a king, but he don’t rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support, but he ain't begging for it
And you can love it, you can hate it, but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ig-nor-ant, though you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm fronting, man, you better come confront me for it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power, and respect in this rap game

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
He's straight outta a neighborhood where niggas hate
To see you blow and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomachs ache while he's lounging in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand where the nigga stay, houses with a bigger gate
Hounding him's a big mistake, he won't surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break
Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helping hand
Till he was sitting on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz to where you gotta mention his name
When you discussing the illest players that's in the game
And he's riding with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and 'em
G-Unit Records ain't a motherfucker stopping them

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power, and respect in this rap game

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
He's no magician man the kid does something out of nothing
So that niggas from his hood act like he owes him something
They talk crazy till they send niggas to where to buck him
Ask him if it's a problem and he'll say "nah, it's nothing"
He was gonna help 'em out but since they fronted fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate him or love him
He held his own on his own the kid is really thugging
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggas think he bugging
He bulletproof everything cause niggas try and buck him
Keeps two pistols on his hip I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggas say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch him slipping they creep in and he start bussing

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power, and respect in this rap game

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
I can give you niggas something you can talk about
I can turn your smile upside down
You ain't no G you a fucking clown
I can take your girl and tu-turn her out
Don't hold it in let it all out
I can give you fuckers something to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth



[Verse 1: Thirstin Howl III]
I hit harder than Foreman, landin' both gloves to a low blow, with no cup
Leave you speechless like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crowbar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls through helmets with the penetration of a screw nailed in
Return like I was sendin' self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles we pour blood and toast, death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress' doorsteps, slaughter lamb and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure, language unfamiliar
Art through a flooded air brush, rogue leaf craft
Sentences joined with words holdin' hands, it's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landin'
In exact time flight leaves

[Hook]
Watch deez, watch deez, watch deez
Watch deez, don't watch deez, watch deez

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Whose arm is this? I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
That refused to renew my seventh prescription of Darvocets (Sorry!)
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
That never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life that's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich and just ate the knife
My mother's screamin', "Please, heal him, take him straight to Christ!"
Meet you in the street and slap you just to break the ice (What up? I'm Eminem)
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol-whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit you was spittin'
I was probably just tryin' to shake the lice
Bugs fallin' out of my head, I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm crawlin' out of my bed, piss and vomit red
And my rash is returnin', I feel the sensation of burnin'
Occurrin', usually during pain for release of my urine
Screamin' at my shadow, "Please, quit followin' me!"
These pills keep screamin', "Please, quit swallowin' me!"
The devil keeps screamin', "Please, get down on one knee!"
I took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

[Hook]
Watch deez, watch deez, watch deez
Watch deez, don't watch deez, watch deez



[Intro: Eminem]
Hahahah, ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength, of Aftermath
Straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together, for Game, bitch! Hahahaha
Yeah! Yeah, mothafuckas!
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass, bitch
Game, let's go

[Verse 1: The Game]
Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty
And decided to chase it, me, him and 50 racin'
This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth and one-take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this, swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this
So they callin' us

[Hook: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
This day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')
It's a new game! You're now about to witness the power
Nowhere, so fuck you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame, bitch
You're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face, which ... Way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
In my face, looking for answers, rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted, the Mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting
Too much time, me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then
We ain't going!

[Hook: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
This day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')
It's a new game! You're now about to witness the power
Nowhere, so fuck you

[Verse 3: The Game]
Lo, get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 Mile, startin' to get home sick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is in it, body armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it, take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For telling me it's hot, when it's not and you got
What you got from them rocks, on the block you just stopped
Telling Dre you got shot, with a Glock that don't fade me
I'm crazy why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady?
I don't care if the radio don't play me I say
What I say when I feel like I'm feeling today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks
So I'm gone, bitch

[Hook: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
This day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')
It's a new game! You're now about to witness the power
Nowhere, so fuck you

[Outro]
Oh, G-shit homie
Told you knock my respect
Shut your ass up
Aftermath motherfucker, haha
Game, Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, G-Unit
G-G-G-Unit



[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah!
You rocking with the Talk of New York Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins
Here we go!

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas when I step up in a bar (uh huh), faggots wanna look (what?)
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'mma stand here as a man and
Let some queer-ass, funny-looking nigga get the upper hand (hahaha)
I got issues, got no time
Got guns that mourn niggas' moms (what else?)
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes (come on!)
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives (ahh!)
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade your gray brain meets Motor City pave'
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay-Z
O's an animals skirts get murked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
Trust in God cause you's about to get catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make not give a fuck

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail, make them wanna finish they last set
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case, then get a bigger one
You don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out the hood?
That's a stereotype, like everybody that's Black can jump
I'm in the white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic, and them
Out in Dallas to the Palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain soft (BITCH!)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it, you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in them, (BOOM)
You know how we do it when we do
How we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizz-ast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot, though
Dragged your little body and fucked like Kim Osorio's
Little sorry ho ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source covers like fucking Cypress Hill (break it down!)
Did in the '90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough secondhand to make my fucking P.O. choke (yeah!)
I'm an OG, you're fucking with a G.I. Joe
Bia Bia, mira mio la vida loc'
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hen, dog
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
(Bring it, bring it, bring it back!)
Nobody told you that I'm loco, ése?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha-D and the 'D' is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up (uh-huh!)
I'll pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for Easter please come
Cause we gon'

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it, you gon' get it
You name 'em and we'll hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
*Hock-ptui* Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a twelve gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death (goddamn)
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around, you know how I get down (woo!)
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it end cause the bad guy die (c'mon!)
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on them? They still look new (yeah)
You can raise your voice like you fitting to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fitting to cut something
They say I walk like Ron O'Neal, and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, the bitch don't know me
Hahaha, sorry Kim (Oh, sorry, oh)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day



[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
There's a Doberman Pinscher and a Pit Bull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tatooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been bastard
The shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fucking automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack-click!

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
Sshhhhh I got a secret, if you can keep it between us
I tuck two nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans



Eminem's Lose Yourself sample playing

[Verse 1]
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don’t care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Got somebody here, might get some now
If you’re not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight, alright

[Pre-Chorus]
So "la da di da di"
We like to party
Dancing with molly
And doing whatever we want
This is our house
These are our rules

[Chorus]
And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
Can’t you see it’s we who own the night?
Can’t you see it we who 'bout that life?

And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
We run things, things don’t run we
Don’t take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
To my homegirls here with the big butts
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember, only Dad can judge us
Forget the haters cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Trying to get a line in the bathroom
We all so turnt up here
Getting turnt up, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So "la da da di", we like to party
Dancing with molly
And doing whatever we want
This is our house
These are our rules

[Chorus]
And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
Can’t you see it’s we who own the night?
Can’t you see it we who 'bout that life?

And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
We run things, things don’t run we
Don’t take nothing from nobody

[Bridge]
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand, oh oh oh
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand, oh oh oh
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand

[Chorus]
And she can't stop
And she won't stop
Can't you see it's she who owns the night?
Can't you see it's she who's 'bout that life?

And she can't stop
And she won't stop
She runs things, things don't run she
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah



"Yeah"
"We did it"
"We did it"
"We did it"
"We did it"
"We did it"
"We did it"
"We did it"
"We did it"
"We did it"

Yeah
Hate to sound like a broken record but, we did it
What else we gon' do, huh?
What else we gon' do but hustle?
Grind, go hard man
We in a position where we gotta succeed, by any means necessary
Failure is not an option (real niggas don't die)
Cause if we do fail, it's back to the drawing board



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, 97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I’m on some loced shit, some fed up with the bein’ broke shit
I’m not to joke with, bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Havin' a coke fit, goin' through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brain’s dusted, I’m disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losin' battles to wack rappers cause I’m always too blunted
Walkin’ up in the cypher smokin’, talkin’ about “Who want it?”
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book I’ve done it
My 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin’ you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your momma’s Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boostin’ Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back trick
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasin’ dips – take ‘em on long vacation trips
Kidnappin’ ‘em and trappin’ ‘em in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
I’m messed up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
I’m sick of the crap, what’s Jack Kevorkian’s phone number?



[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 1]
Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it but I guess I can't
It shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out, Hannah Montana
Man, what's the matter, have you no manners?
No you know the girl from Juno's address
Yeah, I'ma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you? Superman?
All you have is a little stupid can
Of whipped cream, what the hell you gonna do with that?
I'ma put it on my wee-wee, oh good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man go ahead, what you waiting for?
You better get them clothes off, baby boy
Come on let's go, we're gonna make a porn
Ready, set, go hit play, record

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 2]
Are you ready? You better hold the camera steady
She's probably back there with a damn machete
She's probably gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's probably gonna kill you, still wanna check, see
Have a little quick look, go on sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back, we probably, probably
Probably, there probably was a problem
At the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did you?
Now what you gonna do when she gets you?
I ain't going with you, forget you
Quit tryna hold my hand, mister
Pretend she's your little sister, little sister
Might as well take the whipped cream with you
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture
We could try to make another Blair Witch movie
A beastiality porno with smoothies

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 3]
It's eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
Beauty and the Beast, his back is hairy
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very
No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But stop just ain't in her vocabulary
Get off me, please, get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop, she says go
He says no, she says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh, now the whipped cream is out
I get sick thoughts, sick, sick, thoughts
Things you could do with your lipstick gloss
Put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange
Bitch, keep goin', bitch, keep goin'

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Outro]
Banana
Banana
Banana
Banana

I got the Remy for any women that's feeling loose
Your man grillin' and he just stepped on my tennis shoes
I think we met, we gettin' checks like (???)
You see her shinin' with diamonds, glass, a swimmin' pool
All the women drool, when they see the linen jewels
The way you drifted by, it really got me in the mood
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue

[Verse 2: Village Boo]
I just came to party

Valet park

And I'm tryin' to leave tonight, with at least three freaks
Hit the room, you know, until I skeet, skeet
I hope these clowns in here ain't tryin' to start beef
Cause that'll be the reason that niggas kickin' your front teeth

Shit, to Swift and Nani
He's about to get the
Shit, kicked, stomped out of him

[Verse 2: TipToe]
I don't got no time for these niggas that's playing games
I don't take it as a diss unless you sayin' my name
I'm a bad influence, I smoke weed in front of kids
I crack a bottle open and ask 'em
If they wanna swig
I'm the bad guy that touched your wife
TipToe ain't nothin' nice
I rob Benz's and still sport a gang of ice
We gettin' money, we ain't trippin' off you ho niggas
Cause if we want you, we'll come show up at your show, niggas

[Verse 3 Jayo Felony]
He 'bout to get the
Shit kicked the fucked out of 'em

Head for the pushin' and shovin' 'em
So crazy
I harass and embarrass him in public 'em
Just sayin'
Hit a stick that get a guerilla pissin' me with that is Crip
I could get sick as I wanna get, cause you know I'm the shit
Never sound like an amateur, I damage niggas' brains
This buster
Came to be a party pooper, I'm insane

[Hook: Eminem]
We just came to party
We ain't comin' here to
Start shit with nobody
Girl, we just wanna see ya

[Verse 4: Niqle]
Got a couple of handguns, feel like my block is ready
And I'm livin' it Thug Life, like I was Makaveli and
Nigga, this Zoo Life, nigga, I ride for it
I'll die for it and do federal time for it
I'm a inglewood nigga just had me angry brother
I am starting gangbanging because of my favorite color
I done flip the whole brick
I'm flippin' this cocaine
Got socas in line, dancin' like it's Soul Train

[Verse 5: 40 Glocc]
The party don't pop off, unless we pop up in it
If the drama jump off, the first to dive up in it
Infamous/G-Unit it, baby, Shady, Aftermath
I done started my own shit, Zoo Life about to crack
Bloods and Crips, they love me (I get my point across)
Bang on the nigga that's phony (???) sauce
Pick up the phone with the police
And he was tryin' to kick it, but nigga's got cold feet
YAH!

[Hook: Eminem]
We just came to party
We ain't comin' here to
Start shit with nobody
Girl, we just wanna see ya
Work that, work that, body

[Intro: Young Zee]
Yeah, Young Zee, Eminem
Talk to..
What up [?]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
Usually it's beef the more the merry
Me and Em fill up a thousand mortuaries
Till ain't no more room in them cemeteries
And all ya fake mens is dead and buried
But tonight man-

[Chorus: Eminem ]
We just came to party
We ain't come in here to start shit wit nobody
Girl we just wanna see you work that, work that body
With your man lookin' like he could murk somebody
He just sipped a lil bit too much Bacardi
He done tripped into this cup and spilt it on me
Now he’s startin to talk shit to Swift and [?]
He’s about to get the shit kicked in, stomped out him

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
Zee come get the riches
That's how come I drop [?] filled wit sixes
Only bonin' one chick cuz hoes be lyin'
Fuck around and end up like Kobe Bryant
I just came to drink a thousand shots of Rémy
You gon' make me fuck around and pop the semi
Man I live two lives, I roll wit stars to open bars
In the hood we still ride around in stolen stolen cars
Pop shit, I’ll put this gun on yo earing
Till I hear that loud tune and voice disappearing
It’s Crow, man I get high off water
Wake up in the bed wit Ozzie Ozbourne's daughter
Test us, better give a vest to your wife
Or when I said it you’ll regret it for the rest of your life
Yeah, we roll up on a gang of harleys
Zee, Slim Shady, we just came to party man

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Verse 2: Young Zee]
Even though niggas know we down with Shady
Me and Saph, we still got them pounds of eighty
Purple heads bring me dough like it's chips from rappin
Make me look like all my records platinum
And I ain't dropped, when I do just rap at mama
I make a nigga fall off like Cappadonna
Yeah, in the club, don't treat me like a lame in the game
'Fore my lil niggas whip out, aim for your chain
Mad cuz we blessed to them things yall wish
We buy new cars, gut em' out like they fish
Yeah, we don't give a fuck what you say
We got those tech nines like [?] and [?]
Folks tell me slow down, I'm spendin' all my dough up
So what? I throw twenty-fo's on the tow truck
They think we bought no guns what you think?
But we ain't come to fight, we just came to drink man

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Verse 3: Young Zee]
When I roll out to the club with all my soldiers
I can get about a thousand heads and loaders
Right through the front door with all them toasters
They don’t search us, it's Crow them niggas know us
And nobody in the world on the mic can see me
I just spit hot flow and write graffiti
And I roll with mass spanish cats that be acting black
Pimped out caddilacs and they pack them macs
Pop the ignition in your limited edition
Get it come through spinning it, in the intersection
It's chrome, no gold, $300 dollar jeans
Smack their [?] DJ like I’m drama king
Fuck with that nigga the gats gon spill
I drive off in somethin' look like the batmobile, but chill
We just came to chill, money chill, we just came to chill, go!

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Outro: Young Zee]
Oh, oh it's on



[Intro: Trick Trick & Eminem]
Welcome to motherfuckin' Detroit, god damn it
Wonder boy, shit
Yeah, yeah, Tricky
Let's show 'em some love!
Welcome to Detroit!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla "Goon Sqwad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Goon Sqwad!" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla "Runyon Ave!" in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky?
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk
Fuck that, bla bla, I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit
Trick Trick, quick, come pick me up!
Bring them guns, come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk ‘cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
‘Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie, come get me, Wonder Boys, what up doe, I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah I see you, all my Detroit people
Where you at? Man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit, motherfuckers, till we die

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
Homie, it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to five-four and laced the track
This beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad and gangsta
Been bangin' the underground since ninety-five, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence, you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons, come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie, I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see, they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me, but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it being my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fucks with us

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Outro: Trick Trick & Eminem]
Yeah, Trick Trick
Eminem, Wonder boy, Shady
It's going down, baby
Ayo Em, I got yo' back, my nigga
Damn right I said "my nigga"
That's my nigga
Tricky
I pull this mothafucka' out right here
Mothafuckas' don't wanna talk out no more
Niggas come out with them nines and shit
When I come back this mothafucka'
And crack them bitch one good time
Niggas don't wanna talk no more, neutral
Hell nah, every time, please believe it
The mothafucka' said it right there
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Welcome to Detroit
Come back soon
Sorry we missed you
Trick Trick



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, told you we'd be back
Welcome to Hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off
So cold, I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
It's like squirtin' a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off
Other words, I ain't put a dent in the game
Compared to the damage I've yet to do
As long as you still have feelings to hurt
I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
As long as I got two balls to palm, I'll be the bomb
You're just a false alarm
Get scant, little piss-ants
And see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet
With a tornado's the kinda brainstorm I get
So when wind starts blowin’, shit talk about goin’ in?
Goin’ insane’s more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it
Like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast or miss it
Yeah, go ahead little prick bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick-ass explicit flow
Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes in it
Just know that all he knows is that
It's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick Dastardly of audacity
Mental capacity, unmatched it has to be stopped but it can't be
But man I can't just keep doin' 'em like that
Or no one'll rap with me
Except one, you asked who is it?

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Guess who just came through to blast you bitches?
With the ratchet, the book of Matthew, a book of matches
Lighting 'em under white linen
You 'bout to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, asked you, spit it
And you got handed your own ass
Your ass in your own hands, I'm sure they gon' laugh
When you're going to the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come against us?
Better be somethin' with a Bigfoot pedigree
Easily, these are the reasons that we need to be in y'all prayers
Each region breeds some MCs that wanna be the remise
That they wanna breathe our air, with these ideas
Anybody thinkin' the game don't need the Bad and the Evil regime
That's like saying that the Bad Boy Piston team didn't need Isiah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shit piss and bleed, this is a different breed of MCs, I swear
Better beware, there's too much at stake
And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass and eat shit stains out my underwear
That I don’t even wear

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9”]
This gotta be no fair, it's like hitting the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter? There gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got'll lobotomy your hair
Classic, smash it, smother it, read it and weep then
Perhaps you will have no rebuttal and
In fact, you seein' me in this rappin' is like saying
Tila Tequila can sing like Jazmine Sullivan

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Back to bash your skull again, push a bitch out the Aspen
And tell her get the fuck outta Dodge (Dodge Aspen)
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has-beens are duller than color books that ain’t colored in
Second and third, fourth wind, got another wind
Here they come again, none other than Bad and Evil
Also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time, but I bet that neither one of us
Have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fuckin' shit up on the dime
So telling us to pipe down is like talking to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fightin' it while he's watchin' internet porn
'Bout to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is David Carradine jackin' his penis
In front of his tripod, choking his own neck
What part you don't get? I'm saying I'll die hard!

[Verse 6: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
When you listening to my bars, nothing but the F-I-R-E
Coming out your iPod, we come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinnin' like motherfuckin' white walls
Got your mother suckin' my balls while we
Fuck each other, we punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say I'm so–rry, the 5’9” and the Fire Marshall
We spit with an intensity to shut shit down
In the industry, two different entities with a propensity
To put these N-U-Ts up inside of your fuckin' mouth

[Outro: Eminem]
Aw shit, stop it
Yo, welcome to the CD



[Hook - Eminem]
Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you cause there's a D-Block near you

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Place where ain't nobody that proud, it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Working around though, cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
5 minutes flat, the whole town know
Lotta assuming in niggas' salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Welcome to D-Block, the mighty mighty D-Block
The place in New York City where Diddy won't even walk
Its D-Block, the part of Yonkers I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
You'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
D-Block the place where O.G.'s get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You won't even see cops, hip-hop police don't even stop
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be 'Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit Reeboks

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Sheek Louch]
If you bust and your gun got niggas on the run
And you rep where you from nigga you D-Block
And you trying to come up and your pockets is light as a cup
And don't give a fuck, you D-Block
Aiyo bang bang nigga, let's get it on
Always been a monster, but its worse now that my son's been born
And every nigga where I be, I put in work for free
It's D-Block mothafucka, hey yo grab this P

[Verse 4 - Styles P]
Welcome to D-Block, a place where little niggas is killas
And the mother's raising the sons to turn into gorillas
And the hallways is pissy as hell, all we do is get bigger
More ignorant, you send us to jail
My niggas shoot anything that'll move
Sell drugs, from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon
I'd die the way I stand with my man if I can when the shells come
This is D Block, ya'll welcome



[Intro: Eminem]
I live in a world that's different than your world
Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy
Those things don't exist in my world anymore
Welcome to my world
Welcome to Planet X motherfucker

[Verse 1: KXNG CROOKED]
It used to be parks
Used to be jungle gyms
Now they just stories passed down orally from my great-grandmother Nem
It used to be public pools
Kids loved to swim 'til the summer's end
Now it's enough poison in the water to slaughter your son and your daughter
You can blame the government
Let me tell you how it all started
The middle class was evaporated then the filthy rich couldn't stand the stench of the dirt
Poor of course who had the world oversaturated
So a new world order was activated
No more black, no more white, no more brown, no more yellow, no more red
Just high born citizens and low born citizens
And all that race shit was eradicated
You're either rich or you're poor now
Digital identity chip implanted in everybody born now
Being poor is like fighting a war now
No energy to fight the real enemy because you're worn out
Living life on a tight rope, but the trickery is the tight rope
It's slippery as a ice slope
Every second somebody is falling off
So we figure we embrace the misery
Nigga we never liked hope
'Cause hope was the buzzword
That they used to brainwash us, fuck that, we unlearn
Now the rich people concerned
'Cause they know our return is confirmed by holding a gun firm
What's that in the distance?
You fucked slums raw 'til they gave birth to a resistance
You scared looking at your window
You see your own fucking children crawling over your fences

[Chorus: The Observer]
One by one they all come slow to meet their fates
And two by two I bury them in the shallow graves (I bury them, I bury them)
And three by three they've come at me, their guns and swords were drawn
Now four by four before the Lord they'll choose a witchy spawn
'Cause we're coming for you
(Coming for, coming for, coming for you, coming for you, coming for, coming for you)
La la la la la we're coming for you
La la la la la we're coming for you

[Verse 2: KXNG CROOKED]
Yo, what you gon' do now?
It's too late for talking, I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearing the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now
Who got the juice now?
Aye yo, what you gon' do now?
You want the truce now?
I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearing the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now
Who got the juice now?
Oil addiction, water pollution
(Who got the juice now?)
Soil contamination and over consumption
(Tell me who got the juice now?)
Wiped out two thirds of the planets fresh water
(Who got the juice now?)
And crop reserves creating a vast wasteland on a global scale
(Who got the juice?)

[Chorus: The Observer]
One by one they all come slow to meet their fates
And two by two I bury them in the shallow graves (I bury them, I bury them)
And three by three they've come at me, their guns and swords were drawn
Now four by four before the Lord they'll choose a witchy spawn
'Cause we're coming for you
(Coming for, coming for, coming for you, coming for you)
La la la la la we're coming for you

[Outro]



[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
"Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!"
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Bridge: Eminem]
And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
"Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Outro: Eminem]
So baby
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, woo!
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Yeah!



[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady, we're back!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi—
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady (Stat Quo!), we're back!

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick," I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit, nigga, I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dawg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon' tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady!

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady (Bobby Creek!), we're back!

[Verse 4: Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth, I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em, 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga, I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season
So I'm breezin through the track, nigga

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady! (Ca$his!)

[Verse 5: Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth, to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady, (Ha! I told you we was back!), we're back!

[Outro]
Haaaaaaaaa! *Fart*
(What?)



Real {​​​​​​​​​​​​​*echoes*}​​​​​​​​​​​​​

[Hook: samples 4X]
"Real rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget" (what they know about this?)
"When I bust on the mic, I bust real hard rhyme"
"Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it" (what they know about this?)
"When I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme" --] Keith Murray

[Verse 1: Uncle Ill]
I'm back in shit, packin' shit, while stackin' shit
If anyone steps up askin' shit, I'm blastin' shit
You gone fade me, but swinging like Peter Parker
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up
You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback
"You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack"
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid
And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade
Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies
So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies
You're played like my five-year-old's newborn toys
Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz
Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways
That's rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days
Listen up, all these words take heed
When I cock and squeeze, no more MC's breathe (none)
I'm sick of this, here's my final diss
Fuck you dumb niggas you ain't shit like piss

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy
Got your family lookin for your ass on Sally Jessy
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more
Leavin your skull split like Steven Seagal
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a madhouse
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed
We quick to pull the gat out and set it
And leave you with more shit missin than a Lil' Kim radio edit
Stick up kids be tryin to live paid
You get your crib sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your rib cage
Get the gauge, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack
Or I'mma send you flyin like a rocketpack
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
Break into your crib steal your shit and lock it back
Ten-year-old kids be standin on the block with gats
Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
Where I'm from...yaknow what'm sayin? That's some old Detroit shit
Y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though, 'less you come
To my city, ya know what'm sayin? See where we live
Cause we shine

[Hook] - 2X

[Hush]
MCs put Detroit up in they rap songs
Cause without us their careers wouldn't last long
So like a generation we've been passed on
Now its our time to shine, put your glasses on
Got these A & R's and labels with binoculars
Lookin in, jockin us and not jockin yours
Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal
Usin loops that transcend every bitch in you
Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town
One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down
Evaluate the situation, all the rest are killers
Fly hoes out on Jefferson with the drug dealers
Two years in the joint, nobody's touching Hush
Try to say you put us down, but you're under us
Now who the fuck are you? Its just coincidental
When you rhyme you're even worse than the instrumental
You're just a phone-tapper with no backbone
Talking shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome
Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit
Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin' wit

[Hook] - 3 and 1/4X



[Mr. Porter]
Welcome to the ill world of Mr. P yo
Hey keep the talk B
I'm tryna see dough
If it ain't about bread then what we gon


[Intro]
I'm like a white Michael, Vick
Psycho enough to stick Michael J Fox in a microwave with a rock

[Verse 1]
I might like a little Alize with a side of NyQuil and ride a motorcycle bike right through the side of my high school

Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle and a knife in a white diaper liable the shit on you while I snipe you

So dope begits of opiates, what an appropriate way to start off his day, he may just smart off to Dre

He may be hard to contain cause his rages so hard to gauge. See Hannibal ate his face and made Jason gnaw off his leg

Amazing hard-on for razors and blades and anything sharp, even poisonous darts it all plays a major part of his game

Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick he's so sick it's ridiculous saw the crazy part off his brain and he's still insane, why is there blood stains on his carpet mane?
It's some crazy shit going on in Shady's apartment again

[Verse 2]
News flash I'm still trash, them pills should have killed my ass but they didn't they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass, like the six-million dollar man after the crash, it's Aftermath, bitch in my milk glass it's still half empty
Yeah tempt me, hell isn't enough they need to invent somewhere new to send me. As sick as I'm getting they'll stick me in a conventional oven with the rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating-
Shit, I done laid a verse, said some foul shit tried to go back fix it fucked around and just made it worse
Yeah I'm back, lookin' no worse for wear, got these faggots mad enough to rip out their hair and start punching the air
Panties so in a bunch that they can't function, it's Shady and Royce yeah, fuck what a dysfunctional pair
So stop acting like a punk get a pair, take a pill and fall the fuck out spill your lunch in the chair

[Verse 3]
I'll do a hundred yard dash
Just to slash Kim Kardash
In the ass with a shard of glass from nick hogans car crash
You'll end up like the passenger of that, don't be a smartass
Yeah laugh when you sit there thinkin that the hard part passed
You haven't seen pain till leatherface flips mane I'll cut your fucking balls off homie my saws off the chain, I chop the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs and the top half of her torso fucking crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to mike jacks took the Elephant Man's Skull, fucked it and put it right back, handed my dick to Bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nut sack, can't even reach around while I fucked him right in his butt crack

[Outro]
Nah, I ain't takin it back faggot fuck that, I give a fuck about nothin so here's where you fucked up at, don't go touching that can man you don't wanna open up that wait ahh Alchemist, cut that



[Verse 1: Mr. Porter]
Welcome to the ill world of Mr. P-O
Ayy, keep the talk, B, I'm tryna see dough
If it ain't about bread, what we gon' speak fo'?
If it ain't no lead, then it ain't no beef, bro
You better get a leash ‘cause yo' freak ho
Specialize in wood like she Home Depot
I'm like Chico DeBarge, we stars
Roscoe P. Coltrane in these bars
Man, Amtrak, I'll break her damn back
Man, it's Ralph Lauren, this ain't no damn Chaps
It's all Polo, I'm so pro though
You bird-crazy; El Pollo Loco
Talkin' about cheese and this ain't no photo
Askin' about rings like the ho know Frodo
You better get out of my house and shit
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit: I'm sick

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Niggas be lyin', talkin' about they bust a heater
Once I see him, maybe more like Justin Bieber
Leavin' my rivals underground, like Skyzoo's, how I do
I have him layin' in the street and bleedin', butt-naked
With a bullet in his mothafuckin' head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in bein' in a place
Where I'm wearin' Gucci, mane, gettin' whiteboy wasted
I tell a nigga: break bread or take lead
I'm tryin' to get rid of this weight, like K-Fed
Me and Denaun got a gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime thing to you
That ain't the prom
The next MC that rhyme official, with ref, with a whistle
That ain't Young Money, I'ma definitely diss you
If you rhymin' "packin' a MAC" with "back of the Acura"
Or perhaps you can't match my spectacular vernacular
You still rhymin' bottles with models, college with knowledge
Usin' the word swagger, you're probably garbage
You thugs funny, comparin' 5'9" to anybody
You comparin' Superman to Bugs Bunny

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm like a white Michael – Vick, psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwave with a Rott
I might make a little Alizé with a side of NyQuil
And ride a motorcycle bike
Right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle
And a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates
What an appropriate way to start off his day!
He may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain
‘Cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See, Hannibal ate his face, and met Jason, gnawed off his leg
Amazin' hard-on for razors and blades
And anything sharp, even poisonous darts
It all plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous
Sawed the crazy part off his brain, he's still insane
Why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?
There's some crazy shit goin' on in Shady's apartment again

[Verse 4: Mr. Porter]
Okay, it's back to the blocks, slingin' yay like the old days
Superman on the beat, I carry my whole state
You wooden legs to a house: you can't hold weight
Oh shit, it's O'Shea Jackson… okay
A little bit of this twisted out with Obama in it
Mr. Porter back with anthrax, like Osama sent him
Bitch, I'm all that, I drive the girls crazy
They gotta look at Rorschachs to get they thoughts back
I ain't a small fry, small ticker, small tack
I make 'em all cry with big dick and raw sack
The potblood of science to return a raw rap
I'm the best, mane; Eli Porter stance

[Verse 5: Royce da 5'9"]
Y'all bitches should call Nickle the Don Bishop
A poet, a mixture of Don Goines and John Grisham
Flow'll have you rewindin' it four or five times
That landmine rhyme written with porcupine line
Step up in here with the Slaughterhouse
C.O.B. Gang will approach you
And bend your gun barrel to a horseshoe
Only fuck with monsters, we the truth
Monsters will pop up on you
Like you said "Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice."
I can't even see the booth, I could fit in Stevie's shoe
I'm sick, I got the Desert Eagle flu
I'm rich, lil' nigga, we don't need a cent, we Teflon
The doctor tried to take blood, the needle bent; ask Mom
Outta my mind if you can imagine
Usin' Magic's johnson without a condom, I'm bonkers
Got the streets goin', dude, it's tremendous
If I come for your blood, I ain't gon' be usin' syringes

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Newsflash, I'm still trash
Them pills shoulda killed my ass
But they didn't; they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass
Like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
It's Aftermath, bitch! And my milk glass is still half-empty
Yeah, tempt me, Hell isn't enough
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting
They'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done made a verse, said some foul shit
Tryna go back fix it, fucked around, and just made it worse
Yeah, I'm back, looking no worse for wear
Got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair
And start punchin' the air
Panties so in a bunch that they can't function
It's Shady and Royce, fuck yeah! What a dysfunctional pair!
So stop actin' like a punk, get a pair!
Take a pill and fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair!

[Verse 7: Mr. Porter]
Look, I'm sick, somebody better get the Dimetapp
Who I gotta shoot just to prove that I can rap?
People ask where my shine is at
I say check the liner notes, I done done all kinda crap
I am so much of a star, bitch
That I can fart and piss on the red carpet
Look, my bank account's retarded
My debit card's got a helmet and a harness
Hey, meet demands, but they all are harmless
At shows my riders always the largest
I need four pounds of fried poultry carcass
And red M&Ms chartered from Charlotte
Look, and if you try to act dumb and start shit
I just yell at 'em, like, "I'm the artist!"
Infected — you know the deal
If you wanna play sick, we can all get ill
Look, measles, mumps
I made you bitches, I don't need you chumps
Y'all got cheese and I need my chunks
Hurry up, so I can go to burn rubber
And get some more dunks

[Verse 8: Royce da 5'9"]
Now, if your attitude determines your latitude
This house that we call hip-hop, I'm in the attic, fool
A mic and two turntables, fit for the unstable
Converted to a padded room
Keep a street sweeper; in fact, I call the mag a broom
You seein' beef, seein' things
You musta had yourself a bag of shrooms
I make a call, make 'em fake a fall
My clique is too sick, say goodbye
In the streets where the stakes is high, like Ruth's Chris
I'm from the city of true shit
Where the mayor went to jail
For bein' a player right after Proof split
Levels the head of competitors, Royce that
I'm drinkin' everyday
'Til Hex Murda get his regular voice back
Ras, I got ya, look scared at ya, blast from ya
From a block away; ask Tricky, I'm that niggie
I'm more hooder than black Dickies
I rap like committin' suicide
In the booth, takin' the track with me
Patrón's in my chromosomes
In order to leave it alone, you have to ween me off
That Lorena Bobbitt chopper will knock a weenie off
Put your body between chalk
I'm squeezin' the 9 iron, like I'm swingin' golf
I'm with the best rapper alive, put somethin' on it
Your sound's plain as a cheeseburger with nothin' on it

[Verse 9: Eminem]
I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash'
In the ass with a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there
Thinkin' that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips, mayne
I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles
While he sucked it and licked my nut sack
Gave him a reach-around
While I fucked him right in his butt crack
Nah, I ain't takin' it back, faggot, fuck that!
I give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touchin' that can
Man, you don't wanna open up that
Wait a min, ah, shit… Alchemist, cut that!



[Verse 1: Champtown]
Get your rusty ass over 'fore I put a shine to it
See man, it's man I trust so I'mma rhyme to it
20% out of a hundred groups are mediocre
They took a medicine effect and I'm a pretty choker
So once you got a couple microphones well I'mma rep 'em
You got some Nile rapper rivers too, well I'mma check 'em!
Because they new to this, I'm true to this!
They shouldn't be doin' this
A lot of rappers reppin' keepin' miles is a few in this
Game, to maintain, I keep it going on
You hear the guitar and the funky beat I'm flowin' on
I don't tell 'em when I see it, I just spot it
Just runnin' me, have soul and ain't the only person got it
And blacks don't have to act white if they like Red Hot Chili Peppers
And whites dont have to act black if they like Salt-n-pepa
Cause I like a lot of people [?] mucus on the [?]
So I'm Blackened like Metallica, look at me in shock
But nothing else matters wherever I may roam
The microphone's my best friend and the stage is my home
Our music got the sounds, our rhythms got the hooks
I listen to Kenny Rogers, Marvin Gaye and Garth Brooks
I listened to that [?] that's [?] and [?]
But music is good music, the other, is mess
The [?] you chocolate and a peppermint
What color is my soul? Here's a hint: let's hook 'em

[Hook: Champtown, Chaos Kid, Eminem]
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Now open 'em up, even the best eyes squint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Now open 'em up, even the best eyes squint

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
We're up in it, up in it, and way, hi ho!
It's over when I don't get on the tip of the stickity sterile
If you want to high roll
Some people are comin' the [?] road, why though?
With my soul, it's deep enough to shake [?]
My oh my!
[?] someone touches a bottle
The albino brothers steppin' 'em up, we'll wake your [?]
Yeah, I think I'm enough to rhyme so [?] look like a [high-boat?]
I don't play around, we'll run and get the five'o, wait
Hold up! They don't, hold back
To just roll up, they cut no slack
You better step up to bat, or please get a hobby
Cause even a videotape can bring no justice to Rodney
Or IV, I'll put your chest [?] to the point its futile
Get back on your [?] noodle
So you will understand that you won't have the upperhand when
You think I may getting brutal
The America to Bootle
To get the zoom, zam, the zip for the rip
For the kid who had to trip my tint
It's as simple as A-B-Cs and as easy as pie
But is it never to be as intuitive as the question "why?"
Bullets try to inflictin' pain [?]
[?] shade of soul, huh
[?] skills they haven't even thought about yet
But when I [?] they act as if my color soft as my step
[?]
But don't call me Vanilla Ice, Serato  or Kid Rock
And grip with the [cold super missile?] Roundabout
Cause' I'm so down, I'm out

[Hook: Champtown, Chaos Kid, Eminem]
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Now open 'em up, even the best eyes squint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Now open 'em up, even the best eyes squint

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shit, there ain't idiots bad as the fattest skinniest
Sick with a little rapper to never battle, little, piddle or paddle the prettiest
Dumb fuck, lookin' for the hats or suck a numb
Or jackin' jeans keep your hangin' nuts tucked
And I'm about to take my look up it, up in a book
Plus I'm almost on the top of the booty pull that coppin' a district shit
See you're just barkin up tha wrong tree
Cause I got diarrhea, myamia, I uh be a fuckin' honkey
So bad on the mic gotta make ya titterid kid retell what tha fuck I'm saying
He just talk, but neva the type babbadababa they think they shits so poppa hipty
I'd imagine if I were to put up a zipper to the mic i'd be able to do a lip-sync
Because I rap in this muthafucker there's gotta be a certain rhyme this microphone stick, what the fuck i'll hoist it around inside my home
And the DJ better stick up like a rocket
Cause he could scratch on a fucked up a pool table with 27 pockets
Buttafingaz scratches like a girly fight
But if our color matters, take no less than pearly whites
But I’m hardcore like rocks in a tomato
Gettin' skinned like I was boxing a potato
I wouldn't suck on the mic if it was shaped like a nipple
I done made lots'a money so I'm good if i make like a nickel
But I'm out cold like a snowstorm
So I got nuts so fat, it'll keep my toes warm
(Hit)

[Hook: Champtown, Chaos Kid, Eminem]
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Now open 'em up, even the best eyes squint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Now open 'em up, even the best eyes squint



[Verse 1: Champtown]
Get your rusty ass over 'fore I put a shine to it
See man, it's man I trust so I'mma rhyme to it
20% out of a hundred groups are mediocre
They took a medicine effect and I'm a pretty choker
So once you got a couple microphones well I'mma rep 'em
You got some Nile rapper rivers too, well I'mma check 'em!
Because they new to this, I'm true to this!
They shouldn't be doin' this
A lot of rappers reppin' keepin' miles is a few in this
Game, to maintain, I keep it going on
You hear the guitar and the funky beat I'm flowin' on
I don't tell 'em when I see it, I just spot it
Just runnin' me, have soul and ain't the only person got it
And blacks don't have to act white if they like Red Hot Chili Peppers
And whites dont have to act black if they like Salt-n-pepa
Cause I like a lot of people [?] mucus on the [?]
So I'm Blackened like Metallica, look at me in shock
But nothing, else matters wherever I may roam
The microphone's my best friend and the stage is my home
Our music got the sounds, our rhythms got the hooks
I listen to Kenny Rogers, Marvin Gaye and Garth Brooks
I listened to that [?] that's [?] and [?]
But music is good music, the other, is mess
The [?] you chocolate and a peppermint
What color is my soul? Here's a hint: let's hook 'em

We're up in it, up in it, and way, hi ho!
It's over when I don't get on the tip of the stickity sterile
If you want to high roll
Some people are comin' the [?] road, why though?
With my soul, it's deep enough to shake [?]
My oh my!
[?] someone touches a bottle
The albino brothers steppin' 'em up, we'll wake your [?]
Yeah, I think I'm enough to rhyme so [?] look like a [high-boat?]
I don't play around, we'll run and get the five'o, wait
Hold up! They don't, hold back
To just roll up, they cut no slack
You better step up to bat, or please get a hobby
Cause even a videotape can bring them [?] to rob me
Or IV, I'll put your chest [?] to the point its futile
Get back on your [?] noodle
So you will understand that you won't have the upperhand when
You think I may getting brutal
The America to Bootle
To get the zoom, zam, the zip for the rip
For the kid who had to trip my tint
It's as simple as A-B-Cs and as easy as pie
But is it never to be as intuitive as the question "why?"
Bullets try to inflictin' pain [?]
[?] shade of soul, huh
[?] skills they haven't even thought about yet
But when I [?] they act as if my color soft as my step
[?]
But don't call me Vanilla Ice, Serato or Kid Rock
And grip with the [cold super missile?] Roundabout

Shit, there ain't idiots bad as the fattest skinniest
Sick with a little rapper to never battle, little, piddle or paddle the prettiest
Dumb fuck, lookin' for the hats or suck a numb
Or jackin' jeans keep your hangin' nuts tucked
And I'm about to take my look up it, up in a book
Plus I'm almost on the top of the booty pull that coppin' a district shit
See you're just barkin up tha wrong tree
Cause I got diarrhea, myamia, I uh be a fuckin' honkey
So bad on the mic gotta make ya titterid kid retell what tha fuck I'm saying
He just talk, but neva the type babbadababa they think they shits so poppa hipty
I'd imagine if I were to put up a zipper to the mic i'd be able to do a lip-sync
Because I rap in this muthafucker there's gotta be a certain rhyme this microphone stick, what the fuck i'll hoist it around inside my home
And the DJ better stick up like a rocket

[Hook: Eminem]
Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Take some Big and some Pac and mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, what the fuck do you got?
Fifty!
Big and, Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
It's Big and some pac and you mix em up and you got
Juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I got a gambling problem
I bet you niggas I'mma be back bustin'
But you won't notice me when that gat dumpin', you wan' bet?
I lost money when I bet on Roy
Won money when I bet on Floyd, I'm the one that bet on boy
Undefeated, eyes low like I'm weeded
I bet you niggas think I won't be number one again
I raise the stakes, you know why I put mo' on the line
It's showtime I'm goin' for my mine, you can bet that
I bet that tech jam before that mac
I bet that dope go before that crack, I bet my money stack
I bet yo bitch wanna roll with 50
I bet if I said I'm going to the hotel she'd go with me
I bet you really love her man you think she wouldn't come
She got your pussy wooped, her head game, it got you sprung
I'm taking all bets, through all sets I be a bookie
That have to be ten percent off the top, fucking rookies

[Hook: Eminem]
Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Take some Big and some Pac and mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, what the fuck do you got?

Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Fifty! (fifty!) Ohhhh! (Ohhh)
I wanna bet y'all niggas, it ain't gon' be
The old niggas like me!
Trust me, I came up hard! (came up hard!)
All you gotta do is go through my hood
Southside, niggas like me all up and down there
On the corners, in the penitentiary, they from southside
Yeah, they ain't on the top of the charts
They don't know the formula, they ain't on the hot 500
They like me!

[Hook: Eminem]
Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Take some Big and some Pac and mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, what the fuck do you got?

Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot

[Intro: Eminem, (Sticky Fingaz)]
Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
Hey yo Stick, Stick
(Yo, Slim Shady
Yo, I just had like a nightma…
Wait, it wasn’t like a nightmare
It was like a good drea…
Well, it wasn’t a good…) What was it?
(Hey, yo, I just had a crazy dream man.) What?
(Yo, yo I dreamt I was white!) Oh shit!

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz, (Eminem)]
What if I was white skinned, the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing: police wouldn’t always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jocking me
(Can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn’t need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn’t matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn’t follow me around the store
(Maybe he might have stole something)
Like I’d steal something, because I’m black I rob
And automatically assume I ain’t got no job
On my own land, I feel like an immigrant
If I was white, I wouldn’t have thought OJ was innocent
(He did it) If I was white…

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz, (Eminem)]
If I was white, it'd be a different world for me
If I was white, hm? What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class?
(You’d probably live in a trailer park and be white trash!)
In any case, that be the ill shit right?
But there’s a good and bad side of being white
You can’t say the ‘N’ word without starting a fight (What’s up, my nigga?)
Couldn’t dance to a beat, I’d have two left feet
Even if I was white, probably still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?)
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick? (Nah, it’s true!)
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears whenever I heard Hip Hop

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz (Eminem)]
If I was white I’d probably wouldn’t even think the same
I’d watch Tennis and Golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings, man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white I couldn’t live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an Onyx, shit
I be somewhere sipping Vodka and Tonix
Smoking on a Marlboro instead of a Newport
I’d live in Long Island instead of New York
If I was white, I probably couldn’t dunk
Cause everybody knows White Man Can’t Jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn’t be able to go to the weed spot
Cause all of the dreads would think I’m a cop

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, what if I was white?

[Intro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit
Can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you
And that's just being real with you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they
(Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth
And we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!

[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back
(Right) Just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one,
Nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed:
"Whose throat is it?"
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream "I just don't give a fuck" and see who means it

[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

What's the difference between me and-- *Gunshot*

Then I got these crab-ass niggas I first drew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they Ruthless
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors

But you don't do what you supposed to do

I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

[Verse 2: Hittman]
The difference is: I don't care
Can't you tell it by my rigid stare?
I'm legendary, get you open like a Frigidaire
More despair, your style's dead as Fred Astaire
You need medicare, security blanket and a fucking teddy bear
Awh yeah, awh yeah
Is your expression when you eyewitness a session
Vocal pitch making impressions like Jerry Butler
Stupid fucker, I will cut ya
Doing a sucka's such a tragedy, I'll run you raggedy like Ann
You'll kick the pink can like a faggoty man
New styles, I usually keep clandestine
Like files of semen found in J. Edgar Hoover's intestines
No question
But keep that on the low low, Falana slow mo
When puffing marijuana couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm fucking nigga's Mommas
Drama's still part of my dietary
Hit hard like Singletary
Kill your daughter, bust her cherry

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight, hold up hold up
Stop the beat a minute
I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me

[Hook]



[Verse One: Method Man]
Niggas is like "Oh my God not you!"
Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock and roll, new Tecs and calicos
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerrilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, busting yo funky dope maneuvers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm
Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's Lubriderm
10 out of 10 I'll be the, men of all men I mean the
Creme de la creme a schemer, sipping on 'Gnac and Zima
The Professional 2 (DJ Clue!)
Now that Bush is president nigga we all through

[Verse Two: Eminem]
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
Why I keep on ducking under the bed when I hear thunder
Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, they'd be just as many mutherfucking murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suing cause little Darren is screwing
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point
Now everybody's killing everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughing like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfucking-body
I'm so motherfucking nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothing

[Verse Three: Royce da 5'9"]
My wrist is water and freezer mix
This is Audio Jesus, the repent shit gets big
Keep a sharp-like knife in a pop device
So "Duro you gotta let it bump!", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true
I'll suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down, I'm still wilding
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby, knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all of my dogs with me
And they all rich, and still all of their palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walking like we talking drunk while we stumble over words
Clue, Duro, Slim, Meth
Five, Nine, hold up, breath

[Method Man]
It's just, Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do

[Eminem]
It's just, Slim Shady and DJ Clue
I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do

[Royce]
Uhh, uhh, Royce Five-Nine and DJ Clue
I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do

[DJ Clue]
DJ Clue, Desert Storm
Come on man



Lyrics will be available when/if the song is released. Stay tuned!

[From snippet]

[Hook]
Tell me what time, what time, what time
What time you sucking it?
What time you sucking it?
Tell me what time (tell me what time)
What time, what time
What time you sucking it?
What time you sucking it?



[Verse 1]
If the deaf could hear and the blind could see
Would the deaf listen? Would the blind still be
In the darkness? (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... and when you cry I can still see
If you want to die, well then come with me
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls a jade green flower, and early blue
She lets dirty men in her precious womb
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls a rich king sits right on his throne
A shade full soul, he shall die alone
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls on you

[Hook]
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls

[Verse 2]
You say your God doesn't treat you right
Would you stop praying? Would you trade your life
For the darkness? (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... I believe my greatest trick
I made you think I didn't exist
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... even though many have seen despair
Our loyal subjects, they would not dare
Choose the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls... Sex, drugs rapid. Rock and roll
These higher tragedies to behold
In the darkness (The darkness) Oh, the darkness
When darkness falls on you

[Hook]
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls

[Verse 3]
This song is for every kid who's disturbed. Every geek, every nerd
All my ghetto children that lay on the curb
A ruler who can so influence you and give you the nerve
To turn that pain and that hurt into some anger and burns
You damn angrier than everybody whos faces is heard
Shoot random, 27 bodies is facin the curb
Practices using voodoo, oujia boards, he prays with these cults
He casts upon you, your first born will vacate his birth
You sweatin through hot flames while I'm sayin this verse
Armageddon, you shall remain if you ain't praised in this world
Life is messy. Careful, you may got blood stains on your shirt
You don't like the ways things are going? Trust me, death can't be worse
Make your choice. Self murder or get saved in a church
While the pure virgin Mary carries this baby of hers
You were sent to wash away sins that remain in this world
Things go good again, but then a dark change will occur

[Hook]
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls
When the darkness falls on you
When the darkness falls



[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
But baby, wait! – "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

*Curtains closing*



[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers
Have a responsibility to these kids... Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
With real life when the music stops

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically arrived back at my enemies' crib with Hennessy, got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think, I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
To awake neighbours for acres
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin' – you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink till your car spin
You think "Damn!" when you slam into the wall
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal, when I pull up
Lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddy-wagon
Braggin' about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype, poppin' shit in broad daylight
Nigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, "Woof!"
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street: this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues
Nigga, or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"
N.W.A said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson – who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose
And a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the Glock, but the music stops [blam]



(scratched) (3X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -> Mr. Garrison

[Eminem]
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom couldn't take me, the bitch still hates me
Shit, one day she said, "Go rake leaves," I said, "Make me!"
I'm proud to announce I'm probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called the law enforcement when I broke the lawn mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then's
When I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
So anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fucking prick!

(scratched) (4X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"

[Pauly Yams]
Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit Parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in a headlock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than James Evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like Kool Keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease
Parl Yams be the chosen thug
What I spit be cold juice like a frozen hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper like Bushwick Bill, bitch leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'
Your moms just told me to act, I've been wheelin'
So boy just slow your deck, i've been stealin'
I wet rappers cause it's me and Em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like Eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like Bruh Man and bustin' your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggas what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the Dutch

(scratched) (4X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"

[Eminem]
I came to my last show on a horse swingin' a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two Xanax, and I give a fuck what I SoundScan at
Fuck Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm Happy Gilmore, just slip me anything in pill form
I may mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays
And I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats I'mma keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So "I'm the Rapper, He's the DJ"
I'm the one that's got your six year old nephew screaming "F-U-C-K"
So Jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: "No!")
The rest of y'all can kiss my ass 'til your lips stick to my pants

(scratched) (5X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"



[Intro: 2Pac]
Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep tryin' to diss now too huh?
Hahaha! Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
This is what it sounds like - when we ride on our enemies
BEYOTCH! When we ride on our enemies

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
HEYYYY! Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas now I plug niggas, and slug niggas
Am I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, HOW many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we RIDE - on our enemies

[Hook: 2Pac]
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em 50
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some 'Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
You now about to witness the power

[Hook: 2Pac]
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD
Know I meant, every mother fuckin' word!
When we ride on our enemies

[Outro: 2Pac]
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies, hehe
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you got me
I’m up now, it’s your loss
Must suck to be you

[Break: Eminem]
History is like a quarter-note delay
It keeps repeating itself, and what else can I say?
You wondering why I act this way
I never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There must've been a gust of wind
‘Cause you change your mind every time it blows
And you just changed it a-motherfuckin'-gain
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you, fuckin' men
You say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin'?
Some shit is goin' down
You must've just not been truthful from the start
See for me it’d be nothin' to say you never had my heart
But I’d be lyin'
Fuckin' see why they call this bullshit a relationship: ships sink
And you know it's love as soon as you fall in it ‘cause shit stinks
And it feels like every time I fuckin' do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me, six weeks
Have went by and we only spoke twice
I’m sittin' in your driveway, callin' you from the car, suffice
I think it's safe to say you’re not at home
I’m callin' your cell phone
You answer but I can tell though that you're not alone
How was I to know?
It should've been time to go a long time ago
I kept holdin' on, it's comical
When I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwin', I wasn't catchin' your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowin' over me, I'm over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shittin' all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you're goin' to
I’m hauntin' you, bitch, everywhere you turn I'm followin' you
‘Cause I loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true
It's killin' you now, yeah, I hope the ho dies slow in you
It's ‘cause of you now I don’t trust ‘em at all, fuck 'em!
Middle finger up, I’m gon' just keep grabbin' my balls, cup 'em
I’ll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So, buttercup, don't try to come back knockin' on my door all dolled up

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel, I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel, I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, I’ve had it for the last time
Your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
Your options are leave or put out, granted, your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what you’re in love with
You and them bitches you run with
Lately I’m feelin' smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You thinkin' about who's lovin' me, I’m thinkin' about who doesn’t
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splittin', you don’t think I mean it?
Left you with everything I got, fuck you! Ain’t no secret
No apologies, you keep it
Now that I’m doin' my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it?
Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times you’ve seen it
You stabbed me, should have leaned it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
It’s my fuckin' life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I’d break, it ain't that easy
Bet you thought I'd need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Ain't no freebies, get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money-hungry hopeless ho
You fuckin' with my focus so
Go back to that chump that played the role befo'
Love is like a cancer when you don’t let go
I’ma blow fo' sho'
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don’t need you sinkin' us, hope you float
Lyin' through my teeth, I hope you don’t
(Drown, drown!) Not a sound out her be dope
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke
Let them girls crowdin' me go
If they got somethin' to show, let 'em show me
I don't love 'em, never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, I’m laughin', ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car, nothin' is what we are
No beginnin', no tomorrow

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks, Eminem & Both]
‘Cause I’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be aight without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t, ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t, ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)



[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
Oh, we sound like Em clones, huh?
Where the fuck you think he started at holmes, huh?
Skip the small talk, talking is a risk you take
Kick yo' face 'till yo' head go through this window and break
Break to the 1-9, Denaun cause the gun-line
And collect bank from every weed spot like I'm one time
I'm ain't the remorseful type, I'll drink and still drive prone to hit anything at any given night
Fuck leaving my roots, I'm still in cahoots with nincompoops who shoot out like troops in Beirut
Pull up in a red hearse with Fred Durst dressed like a nurse
With a coach purse screaming he's [?]

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
On my Harley Davidson, I ride down Main Street
I speed with my dad's name on my ass cheek
Gimme your ones and get robbed with a broken gun
Got you doing more dances than Puffy's son
All you groupies that wanna get took
You gotta be 12 years old with a coloring book
And anyone else who wanna get fucked, 'cause
(Yeah bitch, oh shit!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We interrupt your little world of perfectness
To bring you the shit to murder conservatives with
To curse and diss, with verses so merciless
These words can just fuck up your high worse than this
{Police Sirens}
I've killed for less, and dumped bodies in the motherfuckin' wilderness
I'm a wildebeest, and I've concealed a piece even after I was busted by Warren Police
You think just because I got caught by these cops once
I'm not gonna carry shotguns to blow your wigs back like hamburgers without any top buns
So many damn murders I can't even count one
Two black guns, I don't know maybe they're Magnums
I don't know what the fuck they're called, I just grab them
12-gauge dumps in a drug-fueled rage, fuck age, still goin' through my "fuck-you" stage
I'm a 27-year-old eleven-year-old, I'mma never grow up, bitch, I ain't gon' ever get old
I'll be sitting here with a cane and a beard
Still insane and as weird as the day I came in here, brain in my rear, yeah
So until I'm wrinkled as Robert Van Winkle, I'mma drop a damn single every goddamn week, people
It's D12, June 19th, so do like me, and go buy three, with no ID
Kids

[Verse 4: Proof]
Now why you wanna play a game with me, dangerously
The outcome's hot, once split your brain in three
Proof with crooked raps, always ask them "What the fuck you lookin' at"?
And invite the hook to scrap
I gave my life to God, nigga, then I took it back
Took it black, this fuckin' gat will leave your cookie cracked
Detroit's derelict arrogant terrorist, straight on you aerospit
Spit at various people, to leave you [?] bloody 'till you're buried with
Every hit was serious, niggas wanna know how murderous the Dirty Harry is
When I'm on your front porch with guns about to bust
'Cause

[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 5: Swift]
When they run into Swift they change directions
My shit so tight when hoes hear it they catch a yeast infection
You need protection, you gon' fear it
I snatch away yo' DNA from existence, with no spirit
Give up the carats or see the nine
Fuckin' with mine is like Farakhan chewin' up swine, on Christmas
With a white trailer bitch on his arm, chillin' in Europe, havin dinner with a Uncle Tom
I attack killin', fuckin' hoes like Matt Dillon
Stackin' obituaries higher than Michael Jackson's ceiling
I leaves nobody livin', I got Satan shiverin'
Hate what I'm deliverin', you know the best then send 'em in, crack you with a fifth of gin
You got your men, but they all wearin' skirts like them niggas from Scotland, you hoes are not grim
Don't make me stop in with a mag, and blow yo feet up out yo Top Tens

[Verse 6: Kuniva]
I'm the one they call in to torture ya
Smackin' your bitch and forcin' her in the back seat of an old Corcia
Kuniva's the silent type, but under the silence is a violent life, usually followed by sirens and lights
Get your throat cut by this tyrant's knife, from high as a kite
And my get-a-way driver's drivin' right
Fuckin' with Hans will get you flipped like a baton, the deadliest bombs
Wrap around niggas like Camabons, you know I ain't nothin' to play with
Thinkin' you real like The Matrix, fuckin' with niggas drippin' off self-hatred
I'm on some live shit, rappers be on some "Ready To Die" shit
'Till I put a ice pick, right through they eyelids, fuck heaters, I'll knock you out instead of shootin'
I hit hard, break yo' fuckin' jaw like Resolution
Give up the cash and coat, or get your little brother's classroom smoked
And the substitue gagged and choked
Nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Outro]
D12, June 19th
Do 'shrooms like me
Get ready for it.
Trouble soon, baby
You know it
Tell your mama and your sister too
'Cause we fuckin' 'em



[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would've thought, standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

[Hook]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (ooh, baby!) — look at my sales!
Let's do the math: if I was black, I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at!
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
"Fuck it," until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now?

[Hook]
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note!"
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot," shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—

[Hook]
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the ​​flag​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!

Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you



[Intro]
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin' drugs
And runnin' from the narcs when they pass by, don't ask why
I'm a hustler, till my ass die
Even if I do come up, I'll be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all
Fuckin' with them tramp ass sluts who supposed to fall
Said she played you for your money, but the shit was cool
Guess it's true, niggas be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you all up in the skirt
Now you lookin' like a jerk 'cause she hurts you
Now hands up, don't be a playa hater, just peep game
Keep your mind on your money, watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker 'fore I shoot, who do you love?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me

[Verse 2]
I'm livin' that, thug life baby!
Steady smokin' Indo, goin' crazy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark, do you love me?
Everybody's talkin' 'bout they know me
But they ain't down like my motherfuckin' homies
Tell me what you need when you see me
And we can get it on, biatch, take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number, baby, call me when you're lonely
'Cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
I'm high till I die and strapped with my .45
'Cause you can lose it in the gutter
I wonder if I'll die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer, I'm all in
Thug for life, nigga, ballin'
I'm gettin' tired of these hoes tryna play me
You can't fade me and my niggas goin' crazy
All day long I'm straight thuggin', and constantly mean muggin'
Breakin' the bitches that be buggin', tell me who do you love?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?



[Intro]
(I never knew I) Mic check, one-two
(I never knew I) Who would've knew?
(I never knew I) Who would've known?
(I never knew I) Fuck would've thought?
(I never knew I) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I) And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling

[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music: this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 2]
So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming "Go!" with their 17-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And "fuck" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 3]
I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop!
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeve
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Outro]
How the fuck was I supposed to know?



Step right up, i'm about to light up the skyline
So bright i'm about to fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks, go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross, but listen close
Stick your whole nose in his crack then lets one go
And blows your whiskers back, then get a great whole whiff
Cause if you last it out, without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of fear factor
Yea back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt
Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? i got a blunt and some jesus juice
Who needs a excuse these days? the way they rally around
Pedophiles you're lucky i don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later
As long as it isn't a racist tape from 88'
That cannot be forgave
If i drank pee for 18 years straight
And eat shit everyday on a porcelain plate
That was shaped like a toilet with a fork, and steak knife
For the rest of my life, i had to watch my wife
Get fucked by Vanilla Ice, twice a day
Cause i said N-I-G-G-A, when i was a teenager
Blah blah Shade-a 45
Shorty let me get your number baby, maybe
I can hump your leg, with something
But it's time for me to go, so i stopped
Jumped in the vehicle, it's like this
Because i



[Intro: Trick-Trick & Eminem]
Yeah, we back baby!
(Yea, let's go!)
I told y'all I was coming back
(We done time !)
Detroit, what bitch?
It's Trick-Trick !
(Yeah !)
And motherfuckin Slim Shady ! (Hahahahahaaa!)
(What?)
Gettin back yo!
Get your motherfuckin' hands up!

[Verse 1: Trick-Trick]
We've been accused of everything
From chest wets, to death threats
The best yet, and niggas gettin' their neck check
Best check to protect
Detroit is only known know
For the best threats
So bet, we got decks and techs
Collect debt
And rest the goon squad
We reck your whole set
We rep the Mid-West
You reppin niggas get wrong
Speak on your songy songs
Sendin' them home
Stone sprone
And broken bones
Better leave us the fuck alone
Keep it runnin' thru niggas
Can't even stomach what
The D got comin'
Waitin' until they frontin' and poppin' off at the Chopper Boyz
We poppin off shots
Guaranteeing a spot at the top
First place for niggas gettin guys who think you fuckin with Trick and Eminem
No you not motherfucker
So next time you see us
Be sure that you make a hole
And when they mention the D
Get down on all fours

[Hook: Trick-Trick]
Got big killas with big guns (Who want it?)
Come to my hood
Get some (Who want it?)
Wanna start shit in the club boy (Who want it?)
Touched up (Who want it?)
Fucked up (Who want it?) (x2)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Ooh wow, look at the bitches up in this club
Man I'm gettin me some digits fo' I leave up out this mug
And it's like boom pow, wam, bam, thank you ma'am
I ain't kissin you on the lips, but I'll be glad to shake your hand
Now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight
Just let me pick the chick that I'mma leave here with tonight
'Fore we get to fighting and threw out
This music makes me rowdy, how they gonna play that new Trick-Trick
And expect no one to get their shit split?
It's just too wild, and one more shot of hypnotic
And I am not in control of my body, I go robotic and blow a fuse out
Homies is like you're startin to stagger
And I'm like: nah that's just my swagger, but I'm dancing with this fat girl
And gettin' loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partying
'Til this idiot dumps his Bacardi on my cardigan and knocks my screws out
It never fails, I'm know I'm going to jail
I might as well take the laces out my shoes now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trick-Trick]
I hear them screamin'
God damn it
There goes the Eminem in 'em !
There ain't no hittin' him
That think that we just cranked up
But he been with them
It's Trick and them
Goon squad gangstas
You can't get to him
We down for the bang and the brawl
But now we killin' him
See ever since we started
You might of had to pardon our hardest
From the largest city
They sayin that we retarded
And charges brought us over
They should just stop
Some of their artists got dropped
You think im playin
Then bring it
Come on lets see what you got
We make the club go bang *Gun shot*
You got that light noise
See ain't nobody fucking with this nigga and this white boy
That been through the realest and the pros
Treated their best like hoes
We put the thugs on
And make him beat it out of them clothes
We don't give a fuck about nothing you used to do
Your record is equalient to high scool musical
No blaming Jimmy Iovine, Paul or Dre
Blame me for everything I say
Cause I got him nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
No damn body (Hell no !)
Fuckin' around, cuttin these niggas heads off



Eminem:
... grab the mic and I am kickin 'em
While I'm getting wicked with the wicked shit
About to be kicking it with ridiculous skits
When I be flipping 'em
Taking mic's and ripping them
When I come equipped to grab
And I stab shit
I stab motherfuckers bad
They go back to the lab
It's like a crack to the crab
Or crack to the crack
It doesn't matter, cause I'm kicking mad data
It doesn't matter who's fatter
Cause if I had a gun, then I would add a whole to your bladder
Kicking the mad fuckin' shit and I ?
Motherfuckers are scared of
In all kind of ways when I rewind blind ...



[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (Sniff it!)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin', "I'm proud to shop at K-Mart," and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin', I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time, I'm gettin'—

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake, but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I’m comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes – dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Outro/Skit: Eminem & Ken Kaniff]
Ohh, please be empty
Please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God!
Shit… Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M.
And lay with eighteen guys naked
And let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back!
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then!
Blow it out your ass!



[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Outro: Eminem]
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Kids!







[Chorus]
I guess I'm supposed to be scared (Yeah)
Cause you got toast up in here (Uh-Uh)
Well nigga lets get one thing clear (Yeah)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)
Is it because I'm standin' with your bitch? (Bitch)
Or got all these stones on my wrists? (Bling!)
Don't think you're leavin' here with this (This)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)

[Verse 1]
I'm on another level when it comes to this, cats swung and missed
Strapped under this
Rap's hungriest, top soloist, hopped over this
Cheap imitations try, couldn't find an ice pop colder bitch (wooo!)
Wires get tap, your rep can't control the snitch
Which, means I'm in the BINGE if I throw 'em bricks
I dump karrots in the RING over flow the wrists
Man, I even bring the thing when I go to piss
Look, money ain't a THING thought I told them this
Yo ball big as Yao MING I'm a soldier miss (Yeah)
Only problem in hip hop is waitin'
Known when that butter, I make the strip pop like bacon
Hatin', so look sloppy so I stop get the rolly fitted
Got a fan base in the towns that think Kobe did it (Oh!)
Them dick riders on the block and they starvin'
Give me a year I'll be rockin' the Garden (Uh-Uh)
They'll still be in the bricks
Same bitch, same sloppy apartment (Damn)
Bubble gum on the top of your carpet
Food stains in your clothes
They can't catch him
Dude's changin' his flows more than his hoes (wooo!)
Just got a Range and a Rolls
And these hoes didn't always love me
I was pissin' them off (Uh-Uh)
Cause you got to fuck banks before you get to the boss (Uh-Uh)
Now I've moved up in rank, ice chips in the cross
To see me blow, is like vice grips on your balls (Whooo!)

[Chorus]
I guess I'm supposed to be scared (Yeah)
Cause you got toast up in here (Uh-Uh)
Well nigga lets get one thing clear (Yeah)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)
Is it because I'm standin' with your bitch? (Bitch)
Or got all these stones on my wrists? (Bling!)
Don't think you're leavin' here with this (This)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)

[Verse 2]
I was destined to swim backwards in cash
Since the day I was smacked in the ass (Yeah!)
Give me that blue kush in the booth and I'll be back in a flash
First week I'll be platinum and half
Going hard in the yard
Still hungry like I'm back in the draft
Same shitty attitude Cadillac in the stash (Uh-Uh)
It's the critically acclaimed, lyrically inclined (Yeah)
And I'm easily influenced, keep my name out your rhymes (Yeah)
Nowadays niggas tell, your own boss set you up (Uh-Uh)
Like Avon and Stringer Bell (Whooo!)
I'm from the ghetto like Akon so bring a L (Yeah)
You're worthless, like a weddin' ring in a cell
Hell all day I'm blowin' dope (Dope)
See the aroma on my coat?
It's stronger then second hand smoke
When I toke, I blow it in the sky for the slaughter (Uh-Uh)
For every mother and daughter that died in that water (Yeah)
For that little girl playin' outside when they caught her (Yeah)
But was suppose to hit the guys on the corner
I make the heads bop in the streets like speed bumps
Cause every bar hit ya, hard as a Muhammad Ali punch (Whooo!)
My bitch got an ass about as wide as a tree trunk
She hit once, Ithink about her for 3 months
Don't you know my nigga L pop off wigs?
Leave 'em in the grass and say hi to their kids (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
I guess I'm supposed to be scared (Yeah)
Cause you got toast up in here (Uh-Uh)
Well nigga lets get one thing clear (Yeah)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)
Is it because I'm standin' with your bitch? (Bitch)
Or got all these stones on my wrists? (Bling!)
Don't think you're leavin' here with this (This)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)

[Talking]
Yeah!
Your boy Banks nigga
Gangrene nigga
You know the team nigga
G-UNITTT!!!
Shady
It's over
Nothin' else wins!



[Verse 1: Slim Shady]

It's the Bushman with art in a dart
It’s six o clock sharp you hear them dogs startin to bark
And while they're carving a mark in ya arm, with teeth sharper than sharks
Im out in the parking lot stripping ya car for ya parts
Boy I was rhyming when you was mispronouncing my name
Like E-minem, now you look for my tapes and can’t find em
Back in the day I'da killed for some radio play
But now i’m with Dre, and I still don’t give a fuck either way
But ima trust Bush to give me a thrust and a push
While these other radio stations are busy playin’ puss
So look to the next man and if he ain’t clapping his hands
Throw him in the bush so fast he gets stabbed in his back with a branch
It’s 98 the one station that runs town
And two DJs rippin’ from sun up to sun down
From sun down to sun up
Slim shady still don’t give a thumbs down
With three fingers and keep the middle one up
It’s 98 WJLB
Watch in October for the Slim Shady LP

[Outro]
Bushman art in a dart
Bushman art in a dart



[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid, you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death-bed
Screamin', “F that!” – yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said, “Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!”
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gonna get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, mothafucka
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
In other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me "Doody"?

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The rage I release on a page
Is like a demon unleashin' a caged
Lunatic as soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
Once I get behind the mic
It's like the wick is lit, you bitches die tonight
My 9 is like a guidin' light at night: shinin' bright
My fuckin' grip is tighter than my wife's vagina (psych!)
These cock-suckin' cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon
Man, the shit's depressin'
But Swift is gettin' me a new one for a Christmas present
Come on, Slim, let's go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson!
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady, stay creative, baby
Hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers
You're a soldier, get up!
Stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathin'
They jealous of you, man, that's the only reason they beefin'

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
It's that Dirty Dozen renegade
You done pulled the pin out my grenade
.38's will move your shit up out the way
You niggas won't forget about McVay
You got somethin' to say?
Let it out today, or watch these bullets spray
From these 10 black fingers huggin' these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer look like he caught a misdemeanor
See, I'm Dirty, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
You gets whipped with it
Tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
You packin' somethin' special in your crib, then bitch, get it!
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
You get splitted, and guess what: I'm blowin' up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a ho
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm eatin crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper (Why not?)
I only fuck animals (Oh! Ha ha)
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your honor!) Six times I been arrested
How would you feel, if you was a Jehovah witness
That always got molested? (It happens)
I'm smokin' dank, drinkin' drank
I can't have any kids 'cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?!
Nicole's a whore, I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut (uhh!)
Responsibility – I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President (ohh HEYY!!)
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi-zarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shittin' diarrhea

[Hook: Eminem]
My words are weapons

[Verse 1: Ceza]
Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada diktafonuna tak
Kağıt kalem bir de ilham alınacak
Tam gaz choppers, havada düşman avına çıkalım
Akalım, haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım

[Intro]
We started in the Midwest
Now we 'bout to take it
All over the world, baby
This is the pinnacle
Yeah, Tech N9ne

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Follow me, all around the planet, I run the gamut on Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with no apology
Pick 'em out the panic, a little manic cause I gotta be
Frantic, I’ma jam it cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at Mama Nakas
I can pop at you proper cause I’m partners with Waka Flocka
Give me the top of hip-hop and watch him make 'em rock
With a show-stopper, chakras popping off the (Worldwide Choppers)
If you anybody, you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul is it
Loaded cold as the polar get wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and I’ma chop, he came and he went tomorrow
But I’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up, I be the ish when I split em up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing I be acting up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keeping the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss, fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standing up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(K.C.)
[Verse 3: J.L.]
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developing
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but loving every second of this

(Denmark)
[Verse 4: U$o]
De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det beatet jeg vækker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild "Fucking Chopper"

(Alabama)
[Verse 5: Yelawolf]
What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning, that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peeling pecans
But instead, I'm peeling rappers' heads, making a sand-a-wich
Pick up a 22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fucking beat
And I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne
Twist up the pine and
Smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes
Well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
Wit' an alien probe

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

Twista (Chicago)
[Verse 6: Twista]
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'mma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly, then I'mma give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
Hopping, I don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwing it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up, should've stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'mma be shining on them haters
I'm finna be using it as energy, watch how radiant I'mma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(New York)
[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
See, now they ask when I'mma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and when I'ma drop it my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'mma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “what in the world is you proving
Wh-when you were already the best” and “what the hell is he doing”
Well, I'ma be chopping and cutting and breaking and beating and shaking
And fucking everything up 'til I make no further mistake and
Busting everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shutting everything up, especially the ones who be hating
They loving everything until I got 'em stuttering-stupid
You hear 'em now?
“D-d-d-d-don’t do-do-do-do it
P-P-P-Please
Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest”
And now I'mma come and kill 'em, get them, hit them, and finish them
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat it coming to killing 'em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Thinking “they gotta be feeling him”
Spitting lithium, see the way a nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid to the point where there's no forgiving him
Hoping you're listening and you're paying attention
And you're witnessing the way that I be christening in the mic
And getting in the zone, I be flattening and packing in
People from the front to the back and
They got me acting a fool, I'm Black and
Nigga now I’m home

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(Kansas City)
[Verse 8: D-Loc]
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
I’m choppin' ‘em, call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killing 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any, in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical

(California)
[Verse 9: Twisted Insane]
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend em and send em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling 'em with that fury
Get up and hurry, you can feel the Real me
Coming up with that shit, I'm having a fit, and you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And popping often hit ‘em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathing, you’re fiending
And dreaming to find a demon, name insane, I’m a worldwide (Chopper)

[Verse 10: Eminem]
Me and Yelawolf
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
You ain't got the umph
You're a hoof to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent
That's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kicking my seat
And I'm trying to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole
When I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation
Throw it back in her face and
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper
That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut, ho
Skidda dee da da
Prada, not a chance
I was thinking about buying you some clothes
But Target's closed
So I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought
Great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know
They didn't carry a size eight in hoes
Oh, this is ugly boy swag
Putting toe tags on you motherfucking ho bags
What a Trailer Trash pioneer
I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea

(Miami)
[Verse 11: Wrekonize]
It's.. that.. son of a stranger
With a tongue to mud the muck 'em for the dummies in dazes
I've been fuckin' up the suckas with no rubbers and razors
Gettin' lucky with lazors
¡MAYDAY! but I've been tellin' ya that nothing will save ya
I'm an animal, cannibal, I'll battle you and abandon you
I'm comin to damage you but damnit I need an avenue
This shit's, gotta be on some misfit, gotta be fuckin' bisquik
Bringin it back to bump it up and break backs
Shame that they didn't create class
Came up to the wrong math
Show me the late pass
She a tech head and she packin' a great ass
Bout to cloud it up but I'm seen out the stain glass
Killer for cinema
And I'm feeling the end of the
Get a little and give it up
I'mma winner I did it up
I'mma change up turn the shit around to blame ya
Cuz you're momma always told ya never talk to strangers!
But I've been walking with a world war way back
And mashin' up the worst I make em all go play back
They better stop me now before I go all a-crap
And make ya dig deeper for the sounds on a dad
A mini epiphany while I'm bringing the energy
Came to fame or pain got to be give me the remedy
It is insane the lane will
Be killin' the industry
Let me contain your dame while we drill the divinity
I'm a rip it up and let em say they grind
Then again I probably shouldn't save they kind
Let 'em all die and never pay they mind
Put 'em in the ground while they tryna lay they lines
Give me a second to sever the 77th amendment and I'll be workin
Wrek up an 8 or 9
Push this motherfucker back into the heyday time
Alot of motherfuckers mad now that iMAYDAY!'s signed sayin'

[Verse 12: Krizz Kaliko]
Nobody can catch him he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I’ve got to audibly body them
This is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain’t ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
(Then I let 'em melt)
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I’m living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'ma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?

(Pennsylvania)
[Verse 13: Rittz]
I am a real Slumerican
Told Yelawolf he can swear me in
I got a heavy double barrel in my box Chevy
When my album drop, everybody scared again
And I’m prepared to win at all costs
Y’all talk a lot of shit, trying to tear my skin
And rumor has it I’m crazy, I need to see a therapist
Well if the shoe fits, fuck it I'mma wear it then
Cause I’m a go getter, other squares pretend
I’m bout to turn up like a sombrero brim
I'm kinda like a modern day Larry Flynt
It’s Slum shit, baby fuck Katy Perry fans
I rep Atlanta, I ain’t never been to Paris, France
I switch lanes, crossing over like I’m Jeremy Lin
You can admire me, don’t let me catch you staring pimp
I’m like a great white shark in this aquarium
When I was young, ain't no kids out caroling
Around the holidays, they were pistol carrying
In despair, getting paper was imperative
I'm reaching in my pocket, only thing there was lint
With lack of parentin', no one to spare a cent
We suited up in all black and a pair of timbs

(New York)
{Verse 14: Cory Gunz]
Marchin' like a martian, hit the starship with the carbon, I'm a marksman
Pewm
Verse for verse, I walk in and chalk men, with the words I'm cursed as cartman
South of the Bronx, the worst department
Swim in the mouth of the swamps, the skirts and garments
Withdrawn in my mental safe in a case to say
I don't think my mental's safe
But I'm sayin' the date issued on the pistols great
Than late crystal wanna be in crystal lake
With a straight pitbull that run a cripple straight
Trynna run a pencil straight through ya stenciled face
I ain't on planes when I swarm fans
And my vains hangin' on vains when I'm on xans
No one in a guinea pants by ya grown man
Stan hands full of strands when I'm on grams
Can somebody tell me somethin'
I know they hear me comin like a copper go and rob an eltiudi
Livin life illegal like it's legal
I gotta carry somethin' till the beta cops catch and tell me nothin'
Cut and get the ropes, I'm a ropesmith
I grew up with the skin of soapdishes if we gotta get it bubbly
Scape snakes wild try, pray the table mine, sound like dubbly
The issue we get speeder
Cuz the militia leader, little peter, got a millimeter heater, and a kilometer rita
See to me you niggas sweeter than a rita, pretty nita, you kilometer rita, I'm an animal Vegeta
Man, she peter, so I eat her when I beat her, she be hangin' of the shoulders of my beater
I be bangin off the meter
Put under the blanky with a yankee get a spanky from the panky like he Jeter
Ha
Drive by nine niggas in the five-seater, lettin' mind fly, blind side leave ya wife beat up
In the mind guys die try to get like me
But my design can fine line any type seater
I'm Re'd up
Kiddy pull the beat up, it's small, I ain't gotta pull my seat up
I'm G'd up

[Verse 15: Mac Lethal]
Killin' em like a kid.. got a Kilogram of Ketamine for Kwanza
Knit a Kimono made of Komodo Dragon skin
I'm rich like a Klingon that be kicking it at the Kremlin
But I'm kicking through your door, call me Kramer Kardashian
Lethal, Literally litter a little limerick
That be littler than a Leprechaun
A menace that'll manifest the melancholy mayhem
Makin a metamorphosis until I'm mechanized like Megatron
Nick Nolte: a nerdy native of Nebraska
Needs a neon ninja and a nectarine from NASA
Ominously, I mean it's obvious you see a:
Orthodontist oozing out oodles of onomatopoeia
Oswalt: Patton
Pickin a pocket pluckin a patent
I pickle purple poop in Patron for pure passion
I got a question, I gotta quiz ya'
Lets step on the gas and go quicker
Really getting ready for the revolution
Reeled a rotten rhythm ring around a Russia Ronda Rousey resort
Serve a simple sentiment a simile that's smokin
Like a sheet of Sudafed i'm swiftly swimming like a seahorse
Titties on Atilla Tell a teller that'll toe tag
Terminator gun inside a turtle tattered tote bag
Thugs are un-american unattractive and unwanted as an ugly pair of ugg's
Vivid and vivaciously venomous
With the wicked wombats only walking where women is
Gettin xenophobic at the Xanadu
XoXo
Yippy-ki-yay,!
Yours' Truly

[Verse 16: Ludacris]
Ludacris goin in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down
I never went nowhere, but they sayin' "Luda's back"
Blame it on that conjure, the hood call it Luda 'gnac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down, like strippers' booties go
My verses still be servin, tight like a million virgins
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in

Imma eastside Cleveland wild boy, eastside Cleveland wild boy
We got baseball bats like the Indians, and my team pop off like Cowboys
You a "white-flag, throw-that-towel" boy Imma "jump-right-in-that-crowd" boy
You a "shhh, keep-it-down" boy, and Imma "fuck-you, blow-that-loud" boy
All I know is how to kill everyone of my cells
All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel
Bring it back into the States, put it on a scale
Measure it at half a eighth, put it in a shell
Split it then I roll it, then light it up like it's Independence Day I got a bottle rocket, put it in the air
Snapback with my city on it
Text back with your titties on it
Levi's, put your kitty on it
Start grindin' like the Clipse is on it
Drink it 'til I get pissy, biatch
Smoke it 'til I get dizzy, biatch
Lose Control like Missy, but Imma Bad Boy cause I'm with Diddy, bitch!

[Verse 18: Krayzie Bone]
What a minute, you probably thought I was finished
With me it’s never an ending
The killer make sure you stay dead
This killer flow that be the gimmick
The illest of any minute
The realest, so many feel it
The lyrics really authentic
So potent that when you get it, you cough or choke when you hear it
Im knowing them niggas fearing, cus i got up in their spirit
I told them niggas in the beginning that Imma kill'em with 2000 words in 2 minutes (PIN IT)
Who that nigga running with the AK-47 packing pumps like it fit through us and 357
HEAT, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready
Im like a disease, I keep spreading

OK Drago on the track spitting fast. Rap with skills past any other. A Dragon on the track with nothing but the fire in my verses. Messing with the man repping Germany be against your fucking intuition. Flows coming out of the pen fast and furious. This rap game is perilous with no muthafucking rappers other than I murdering. Yall want me to slow down and stop but as a chopper with no limits I be a murdering. The game be insane nailing niggas and killers to walls and even up with these balls. Nigga no chill Olaf with a frozen nose and breaking Bones. Muthafucker cut you up cook you into Brownies. Nigga my bros like Gabriel they not fat They Fluffy. Puffing on some Mary Jane with some heat no electronic gizmos. Nigga I am Steve O with no shit leaving Paws and shit. Germany for Life until we got......

[Verse 20: DJ Death]
Chopping from Arizona with the flames and some Ray Bands. Nigga all this money throwing it up Make it Wayne. Nigga all I do is Slay don't play rip verses faster than any muthafucking Michelin Man. This is a Do or Die instance like Chicago with no shit be ripping. No wonder you wanna quit i'm just flaming No killers but I be Insane and I be ripping shit up. I'm No Twista but I'll Twist Ya up Like a Tornado. I'm no Nazi no Gestapo but I be murdering anyone up on a choppers verse. Epic Rapper with some epic beats niggas messing with me be wetting their sheets. Arizona flames  Name is Arizona James leave mikes in flames. Nigga these other rappers sound like they flow pre-heated. Every one buying there albums are cheated. I'm a chopper and I know who I be murdering. The rap game won't be the fucking same. Arizonian is outta control got all your girls like Dungeon Nightmares B to Blow! Muthafucker I'm here because I'm....

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah! I don’t know what else to say
I can’t, I can’t think of nothin'
I’m stumped, here we go!
On your feet! Stand up! Everybody hands up!
Uh, man, I don't know man
Every time I go to think of something played out to say
You already said it

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
I ain't callin' names 'cause all of y'all the same
Plus I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter's came up
'Cause they know their hands tied, feet ball and chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial, but here's the brain fuck
We the same, 'cause
I'm probably 'bout to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fuckin' game up
Bitch, splat! Only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
You are hearin' bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy, try us, wavey bye-bye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to Baby's Maybach
My shit is parvo, literally sick
Trust me, nigga, it's ugly to kill; the thing is, the bigger I get
The more disgustin' and fuckin' disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
Y'all about the Champagne, I'm about the toast, I
Only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas that'll smoke you while you starin' in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'
While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
I'm back! Motherfucker, notice the flyness on the cover
Of the XXL, I'm back from the dead
Like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How y'all realer? If I said it, I did it
If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a card dealer
Give up the throne: your lease up; I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin' your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
Makin' the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait 'til they get a load of me, 'cause—

[Chorus: Royce da 5’9”]
I've got Guccis on my feet, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk, models in the front
Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

[Bridge: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it
Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin' on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion, but we sittin' on your grave site: overkill
Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet
Real dudes move in silence, like a mute drivin' a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal
You will just be another victim
I'm like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie: I'm a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies, y'all just got scripted
Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one when she wit' ya
When she with me, she bobbin', not vibin'
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I'm a serpent with a purpose
Havin' problems? Not a problem
I've encountered, I have found elephants, lions, clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the circus
If the fire 'round the circle's right in front of them, fire rounds
Pun intended, gun extended, what are you marks askin'?
Car's Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it
Since I decided to start class, this all black, all glass
Panoramic roof been gettin' marked absent
I authorize my own all-access
Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'
Her jaw's been broadcasted
All across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to be blocked and reported as spam
Interscope, I been this dope
Now sell it, my voicemail is full
Got bitches screamin' inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail ‘em to me
Tryna reach my phone, I don't know which one is harder:
Tryin' not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own

[Chorus: Royce da 5’9”]
I've got Guccis on my feet, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk, models in the front
Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck

[Outro: Eminem]
Man, get the bozac!
We need to start bringin' that shit back (Mad flava!)
Man, fuck it, I'm 'bout to catch some wreck
(We in effect, money!)
Mad props to Royce for keepin' it real
On the strength, no diggity
I'm 'bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on
Haters get the gas face!

[Intro]
Yeah! Oh! Get up (Where my trash at?)
I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain’t stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing
'Cause we ain’t come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now
And grab someone

[Verse 1]
Man, first of all; I’m a boss
I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it’s a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on ‘em, Michigan plates, and my name's on ‘em
Baby, Shady’s here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain’t stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won’t do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There’s a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She’s got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call ‘em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who’s the man now get amped, dance

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (white trash party)
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party (white trash party)

[Verse 2]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
I'm mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I’m hollering "Die Santa"
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I’m not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I’m throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny’s
From the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood’s tighter than Kenny’s
So, ladies, if your belly button’s not an innie, then I’m outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (white trash party)
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party (white trash party)

[Bridge]
Now whether you’re black, white, or purple
If you’re misunderstood
But you don’t give a fuck, you ain’t doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you’re up to evil and you’re no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

[Verse 3]
Now honey, don’t let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
'Cause, girl—I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, I’ll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain’t like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don’t need a tank top to be a wife beater
I’ll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I’ll tell you now, I’m so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that’s against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party (white trash party)

Cuz as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'(oh)

Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west(oh), but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks

So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie

[Eminem]
Now whether you're black, white or purple
If you're misunderstood

You weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood (ah ah awoah)


[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows

Party party party



Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'mma' sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'mma' still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No wonder I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up?
You talk a lotta' junk but you was never ill though
I'm strong enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick trick; it's an image, I live it
Give a damn, I don't know what a damn is to give it
Man I don't think this guy is well, I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll friggin', I'll friggin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them stuffs with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and glue your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itching to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves
I was teething with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walking through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
Flashing back to being shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked
And if you do live, you'll be too scared to tell it like a Biggie and Pac joke

The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon, hop out of a Grand Am and land in it hand-standing
Any man planning to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten speed
Screaming to Aunt Peg with three spokes
Sticking outta my pant leg
Forget a headache, give me a migraine, dammit I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack, you act up and I'm throwing you
Down a flight of steps then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, f- them, the rap struck 'em harder
Than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'mma' climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left



[Intro]
"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls (Yeah) their throwaway children."
"We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross." (*Burp*)
"We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better."

[Verse 1]
All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Bridge]
I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head, like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme."
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 2]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!) "Exist in a state of red
Black and green, with a key, sissies!"
Now with this being the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was being laughed at
"You ain't even half black! You ain't 'posed to have that
Homie, let me grab that! And that Flavor Flav clock
We gon' have to snatch that!" All I remember is meeting back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn
Girl in our whole school, if I could pull her, not only would I become
More popular, but I would be able to piss Kim off
At the same time, but it backfired
I was supposed to dump her, but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the "Ole Foolish Pride" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a—

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Outro: Debbie Mathers]
Fuck out of my house, you fuckin' pieces of shit!
Get the fuck out of my house, you stupid fucker!
You son of a bitch!



[Intro: Tony Yayo & 50 Cent]
Shady!
Yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now, homie, I say I run it, run it 'cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón
I have you feelin' a'ight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin', shawty says she comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it, okay, now maybe I've said it
'Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidit
You should see when I'm stuntin', I flash the stones to be wantin'
Push the whip, see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know the Unit's the gang
I got my grimy Shady with me, you front, you'll have to get me
Off yo' ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh
Haha! It's not a big deal, it's nothin' but some cash
Let's go!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? I said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens, mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
See…

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keeping it raw
Illegal like Malik and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law
Like I'm Steven Seagal
Flipping off the police while I'm leaping the wall
Take some Tylenol then fall asleep in the mall
Got your little son, you'll be receiving a call
You're lucky this little punk's still breathing at all
Fuck the world, this is how I get even at y'all
Popped sick and rolled up, and leave in the vault
I'll hit you in the mouth and stick your teeth in the jaw
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
Speak of assault
It's giving you a reason to stall
Cocking this deuce deuce and I'm squeezing it off
At the first burp and a fart
A sniffle, a sneeze, and a cough
Get your arm chewed off
Like you was teasing a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and then thaw
I kicked my girl out in ten degrees in a bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
I'm shitting on rappers
"Where's Shady?"
He's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw
Motherfucker

[Hook]
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me

[Verse 2: Hot Karl]
WUH-OHH! I bet Jimmy Iovine's scared
Hot Karl and Eminem, same song: nightmare
But let's break the rules and be a rebel instead
And jack unused lyrics from rappers who aren't even dead
Thank you Rectangle for these sixteen bars
With a track so sick you can use 'em as SARS
Too many rappers think they're 2Pac and they should stop
Unless it's him in Poetic Justice, workin' a post office
Then you quit rap dog, proving your pedigree
Is questionable, like Da Brat's femininity
I'm not a gangster, I'm just trying to live
And take you back to the days like Garbage Pail Kids
I'm playing the bigs, your whole game is sloppy
Only time you're rocking cyphers is when you get bukkake'd
Yeah, it's Hot Karl, I'm going for broke
I guess a hit is still a hit: sorry, Interscope!

[Hook]
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me

[Verse 3: Dree]
An ass-whippin'
That's what Dree's givin'
Tighter with my flow than what most niggas is spittin'
I'm the one packing a MAC in the back of a black truck
While y'all niggas be sleeping you need to be peeping a color
Slam through your speakers
Hit one of the tweeters
Lyrical styles I disperse is harder than your peter
{Wait, how did she know?}
You better ask them about me
I hit 'em up, get 'em up
Then I spit 'em up like loogies
Fucking around? Test me
I'll hex you like a voodoo
Get an ass like Charmin and flush you like a poo poo
Lyrical Smith & Wesson is ready, I got my shotty
Cause when I get to spitting I'm leaving bodies like Gotti
The head banging Madonna's coming like them nigga
Only difference is? Female is my gender
What
Y'all heard me

[Hook]
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me

You must be crazy
If you want to fade me
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me



[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I’m growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over

[Verse 1]
If Proof could see me now, I know he’d be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there’s somethin' in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it’ll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means "suicide," homie
You’ll never throw me off of this course, blow me!
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I’m not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it’s lonely
On top of the world, when you’re the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y’all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I’m not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
I’m moppin' the floors with 'em
I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won’t be long 'til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors
And no, we ain’t pumpkins on Halloween
But we’ll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain’t no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I’m S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn’t travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don’t think you understand how much you meant to me

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I’m growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over

[Bridge]
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, I’ll never forget you, nooo

[Verse 2]
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it’ll blow up the mic, it’ll put the "dyna" in mite
Yeah, it’ll make the dopest MC
Wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it’ll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do
Right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I’m gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death
I’d rather celebrate your life, elevate to new heights
Step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I’m feelin' tonight
Everything I can just do right
There’s nothin' that I can do wrong
I’m too strong and I’m just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it
Excuse the corny metaphor, but they’ll never ketchup
To all this energy that I’ve mustard
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I’ve been patiently watchin' this game
Pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I’d come out of this slump
Rise from these ashes, come right back on their asses
And go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I’ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I’m never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I’m goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night
Had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, "Naw, Doody, you’re not!"
Layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said, "think of Hailie", I knew
There wasn’t no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies
And Proof, not many are lucky enough
To have a guardian angel like you, Lord, I’m so thankful
Please don’t think that I don’t feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need
For one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I’m growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over

[Bridge]
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, I’ll never forget you, nooo



[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and I'll finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Looking for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we -

[Bridge 2: Nate Dogg]
We finna have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head, shake your butt!)
I'm looking for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head, shake your butt!)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Outro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
(God! I ain't leaving without you, bitch!)
(You're coming home with me!)
(And my boy, and his boy - and his boy, and his girl)
(Haha)



[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy, oh, crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!

[Verse 1:]
I won some battling, embarrassing, leaving you passed out
Pants down, butt fucked by the Vatican
You show me what a faggot is, I'll show you what a Magnum is
You dead in my eyes, I'm just blasting where your casket is
A young bastard, that's beast and crazy
I was found in the street and raised up by Shady
No sound when I speak, but you know what I'm saying
When my trigger finger click, you would know I'm not playing
I'm the climax of Jason, seed of death
In the Ku Klux Klan, hanging niggas to rep
I'm an authentic asshole, choose your step
Or get tekked, next step you would lose your breath
I ain't here to conversate about whose a fake
Cause every time you drop an album, you lose respect
I'm one of a few rappers that do Mathers a G
From the West Coast chapter, of King Mathers, Skreeeeech...

[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!

[Verse 2:]
Lyrical, no subliminal, shitting on you on literal
What you hold, identical to genitals, you dick ridah
Oscillate me from them guys I spit fire
But I'm a murderer and not like them liars
I crush empires, live by us inside of wires
In light of these niggas riddin' by us, try us...
I clip fliers on your lip, then sprint, trying
To rip your fucking mouth off, you bitch... dying
For all standards, flip cannons, shots landing in your face
Now your bodies abandoned, I can show you how to body a bandit
With a shotty I'm standing, in a lobby like Pac nigga, but I ain't get shot
Got grazed, unfazed, gun slang and bang, pump 'cain all day just to earn my name
On the block where I turn my game, I'm Cashis nigga
You motherfuckerz better learn my name, yeeeah...

[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!

[Verse 3:]
Maybe Shady raised a Satan baby
I can feel you hating lately, I've been sniffing, drankin', violating my probation
Ya'll can't take me I'll go crazy, you don't want that situation
Wasting tax payers money, giving me all these cases
My past is a violent one and I can't erase it
I'm getting fresh out of jail, and racing back to the station
Staying wasted, I get the bombest chron, with coke that I lace it
Getting close to Cobain, I drain, I'm there I can taste it
It don't take a million takes for me to walk in and lay it
I got a cater, say these motherfuckin DJs will play it
Walking up congratulated, but inside I feel hated, or maybe it's the hatred inside
I spew cause I'm hating that everyone of my guys died, before I can make it
You the false ridah, I don't like you I can't fake it
See I'm patiently waiting, A buzz bangin', and waving my gun
Pussy quit talkin' shit and close up your lady you punk...

[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy, oh, crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!



Zane Lowe: Welcome back to Radio One, Maida Vale studio 4 here we are. Part of the reason we're here obviously because its the BBC but also because we have Studio 3 around the corner and you've got the band set up and going to perform some songs as well.

Eminem: It's super exciting to be here. I was trying to figure out how I was going to top the publicity of yours and Kanye's interview so I decided I was going to walk in here, pee on the floor, and leave. I'm peeing right now. Alright see you guys later!

ZL: Seeing you with the band, and seeing you perform the other night at the awards show and seeing you on the mic, it was, I don't think I've ever seen you more alive on the mic. It was full of energy and in the moment. What I noticed was as well was spitting live with the band behind you seemed to free you up a lot more. Are you feeling that way?

E: I think performing has gotten a lot different, it's gotten better with the band because there's just more elements to it and being it is a live show, there's more places you can go with it. There's things you can do with your hands, it's really cool, it's different. I think it's better.

ZL: Spitting Rap God that just puts everything into perspective I think for everybody else. When you wrote that and you got that one down and recorded it...

E: I didn't write that, I freestyled it, off the dome, 1 take.

ZL: Absolutely ridiculous. I mean, the song is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

E: Thank you

ZL: When you get to perform that live that must be, I saw at the end once you finished that, that's a challenge for anybody. At the end you must feel like 'Wow'. That's a lot of rhymes to get through, it's like 5 or 6 minutes non-stop.

E: Um, Yeah the other night I don't think we did the whole song. We did kind of a Deadly Medley.

ZL: I don't even know how you would cut that up and make a shorter version of that because it's such a stream of consciousness through the whole track.

E: Yeah I don't know. I wouldn't even want to begin to think of that, because I think it is a... stream of consciousness. Nice stream of consciousness, running down my leg.

ZL: The album itself has been so well received by everyone including fans across the world. Because in my opinion listening to it now it's kinda the perfect combination of the venom and the danger that existed on the 1st record but also what you've been through and what you've learnt over the past 5 or 6 years. It's kind of like the combination of the two. Is that fair do you think? The first album that feels like it's slightly grown up, but also going back to some of those subject matters and dealing with that stuff.

E: It's grown up and down. I mean some of the themes and topics and things like that are revisited on this album, but at the same time I feel like its kind of a 2013 version. All my albums I think, for the most part, pretty much tell where I'm at, you know at each one at that time period, whatever. So this is kinda like, there's a lot of reflecting and things like that back on everything that was happening during that time, you know. And it's kinda like me reflecting on it and getting to the point where I am now with it.

ZL: Settling some scores as well, and burying the hatchets and dealing with stuff once and for all. Do you feel like this album has allowed you to do that?

E: I mean some stuff, yeah. But for the most part I just felt like it might be fun to just revisit that, the overall vibe of that album. Just because it started to go there in the recording process.

ZL: So when did that begin like you were going down that road?

E: I had started making a few records for it, and it just sounded like the tonality of it, the tones of the records kinda were heading towards that way. And I figured out what direction it should go in, kinda started gearing everything that way. And alotta times, making an album, I dont always have the direction or concept early on. Sometimes it doesn't come until the middle/towards the end of a record to figure out where I'm actually going with that... that's just a culmination of songs, and depending on what the vibe is. Sometimes I do a songs that is so left field one or two of them its like Oh Shit where am I going to put these songs and now what am I going to call it because its not going to make sense to go, let's say Recovery or whatever. But with this one I feel like I kinda got an earlier idea for a concept.

ZL: That must be nice actually to be able to sit down and carve it out as it was going and have that end result in mind, to piece it together that way.

E: It was, but it wasn't, in the sense of-- I had to record a lot of songs for it because I felt like if I'm going to call it that, I want it to make sense.

ZL: And the stakes are high as well. I was talking to someone about this before and they were saying, "Eminem would never consider one of his albums to be a classic" he's not that way inclined. But you know how people feel about the Marshall Mathers LP, it speaks volumes. And then the critics, every layer of it, it is considered a modern day classic album. Did you consider the expectation of calling it that and what it would mean to the record overall?

E: Yeah, I had kinda known that going in. Once I kinda knew what direction I was going, I knew that I needed certain songs to be able to call it that, and like I said to be able to make sense. But, I just wanted to make sure that I had the right ones, and in other words, I knew that, obviously Stan off the first Mathers LP was a big topic. And I had heard a lot of chatter around the time doing the Recovery record that I should do Stan 2 and why doesn't he do Stan 2, and all I kept thinking was Stan's dead. You know what I'm saying, he died in the story. So in the back of my mind I kinda had an idea of who could be left from the story, but I needed to get the right beat and be able to...

[plays song]

ZL: As soon as it starts as well. Did you know immediately this would be the beat for this concept?

E: Yeah, as soon as I heard the words to the chorus... I got this beat, this beat was sent to me and had those words on it. And sometimes for me it's like- I like making my own choruses and its also fun for me to take someone else's words and interpret them my own way.

ZL: For sure, when you hear that chorus I'm sure initially... it's a 1st person scenario or self hatred scenario, but its tied into- there's layers to that. Being bad is good I hate to be it but here I am and I'm back again. And then you got to deal with the story, and at the end it's taking everyone to the end when you couldn't be facing down any more of the criticism both self and by others that you faced throughout your career. I mean it's the ultimate type of acknowledgement isn't it?
Meeting your maker almost really, is that the inspiration behind it?

E: It's kinda like saying, if you're going to go down this road, then you're going to call it this, and this is going to be the title, and this is all of these things coming back on me.

ZL: It's an amazing opening to the record and it's really ambitious as well. So you set the bar really really high and from here we go to Rhyme or Reason, and I love that beat and love the big samples and first time you reference Rick Rubin as a producer on the record. When did you first have the idea of working with Rick?

E: I've always been a fan of Rick's, and my manager Paul had been talking to him and Rick had expressed that he had interest in working with me. And when Paul brought it to my attention I was like super excited, honored at the fact that he was even thinking about it. I had my reservations just because I felt like I'm a super fan of Rick, and I'd probably be a little nervous and wouldn't know what the vibe would be because I would be wanting to impress him. It was very much the feeling that I got early on with Dre.

ZL: Had you met Rick before?

E: Nah, I'd never met him. So I was like nervous to meet him and you know, even more nervous to work with him.

ZL: Same thing with Dre, all the way back, same kind of experience when you walked in the studio and saw Dre that time..

E: Yeah I'm still always trying to impress Dre too to this day at the same time. But I just kept thinking if I got in the studio with Rick, what if we're not able to come up with anything. I had all these things in my head, and then when I met him, the guy's so laid back, it made it easy. And his vibe in the studio is very much like... "Try whatever", don't be afraid to try whatever, even if the idea in the beginning is stupid. Because a lot of ideas in the beginning stages, not mine of course, mine are just insane from the moment I think of them- but sometimes ideas are not always the greatest.

ZL: Don't be afraid to fail to get somewhere else, to get on the journey.

E: So if you say one thing that's going to spark another thing to lead to a better thought, that's kinda how it went. We started going through old break beats and I was trying to tell him I kinda had the idea, I kinda had a notion that I was going to call it the Marshall Mathers LP 2, but I didn't want to say anything yet to him because I wasn't 100 percent sure- and I wanted to make sure that I had enough songs to even play for him that would make sense. I love the sound that Rick gets when he does hip hop. Even from early on, Beastie Boys- it's incredible. And that's what I was kinda hoping to get.
How can I make the record sound nostalgic, but subliminally nostalgic. So it reminded you of maybe 13 years ago when you first heard me but its overs beats that are even older, but you're not sure why you feel this way. Tried to create a feel, so we started messing with old samples and break beats and things like that- cuz Rick is super talented and mastered of every other genre of music as well. The way he dips in and out of just different genres is crazy to me. Like I said, I was hoping to get what I got from him.

ZL: The first time I saw Berzerk as well, I was so happy to see the way that you came through, and the video the way the colors were so reverse Beastie Boy style- it was fan boy stuff for me. To be able to go out in a beanie like the Ad-Rock thing and it was cool, I love that.



[Snippet from "Brainless"]
"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit."

[Zane Lowe]
Let's talk about your work on the record as a producer, because I know on Relapse you did nothing, on Recovery you got back into it, I've always said to you as long as I've know you or you've been making beats how much of a fan I am of your particular music, your production for others as well as just for yourself.

[Eminem]
Oh, thank you.

[Zane Lowe]
And so to hear you back making beats again on some of the standout beats on the record was a real thrill. So, I mean, how was that getting back into the producer's chair and deciding to wear two hats again?

[Eminem]
Urm, I mean that was fun, it was fun to, to be able to, just mess around with beats from scratch again and, you know, sometimes, like, I think Recovery was the first time that I ever got really super-open to, urr, working with a lot of other producers, you know that was the most I had ever done, and, you know, aside from working with Dre. You know, so, on that album kind of opened those doors a little bit, so that's kinda how early on, we started approaching this record, or this album, and sometimes, like I may get something in my head like an idea or the mood of something that I would want and I'm not always gonna get that by going through, you know, different tracks if other people have made, they don't know what's in my head, you know what I'm saying, so it's also a good way to, ur, I think maybe it helps with diversity a little bit too, with the sound and all that, you know, I would get something in my head and wanna be able to lay that idea down from scratch.

[Zane Lowe]
It just sounds like your being inspired by rap, in a big big way, I mean...

[Eminem]
Absolutely

[Zane Lowe]
I mean, I know you've always been that way, we've known each other for a long time and I've met you at various points throughout every album and I know that it's...

[Eminem]
I just met you, out there I thought... It's all good man, I'm still peeling the floors. (Laughter)

[Zane Lowe]
Um, you know and the music reflects your head space, it's always been pretty honest, not just lyrically but also musically I mean there was a time when the beats you were making were all very kind of minor key and lots of strings and lots of, kind of, a lot of Drama. The beats on here are fun. I mean, they're fat, big and rap! Like inspired by hip-hop!

[Eminem]
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much all I do, and all I wanna do, you know what I'm saying like, so it's fun for me, like I'm still, you know, like I'm still passionate about hip-hop, and every aspect of it, so, making beats and producing, you know, is definitely, it's fun for me.

[Zane Lowe]
What is it about rap that you love? I mean I'm a huge, I mean I grew up on hip-hop and it forms pretty much every sort of thing I've ever done in my life pretty much to some form, and what I wondered, you know, being someone who is considered one of the greatest of all time, what is it about rap the art form, if you can even trace it back to when you first discovered it, to how you feel about it now and what are your most rap-heavy records?

[Eminem]
You know, just a lot of rap.

[Zane Lowe]
A lot of rapping on there, a lot of words?

[Eminem]
Yeah

[Zane Lowe]
What is it about it that you love, if you can put it into words?

[Eminem]
Hmm, I dunno, I, urm, I love the fact that you can, I love the expression of it. The fact that you can, you know, just, I don't know, I love the, I love beats and rhymes and I love the fact that you can express yourself in a rhyme and lay it down and it can be therapeutic, and you've got it off your chest, and then you could go on to the next thing, I don't know, there's so much shit that I love about rap, you know, I'm in it for like, I love to watch what's going on in the game and keep my finger on the pulse of that, you know, and it's exciting to watch as a fan, for me too, you know, just being a fan of hip-hop, urm, and watching as it, you know, the evolution of it, and, you know, how it moves from each year to year, you know what I'm saying, the direction, and...

[Zane Lowe]
Are you sort of relieved that you can be that now, you can be a contender for the world's greatest rapper along with a selection of your peers and it can be a really amazing rap record and to a certain extent, I hope you take this the right  way because I know your strong career, very popular, number 1 in 80+ countries, huge, but the pop stars kind of did, you know, in the sense of what people expect from you these days, isn't it, you don't have to be that guy any more, you can just be a rapper and make rap records if you want. Is that a relief?

[Eminem]
Well, yeah, I think so, urm, it's one of them things like, as far as like, being a pop star or whatever like, I never, never intended to be any of that, you know wha I'm saying, like, all I ever wanted to do was get respect from, you know, my peers       and other rappers, and, urm, all the other stuff that came with it was just, you know, confusing to me, it was, I don't know, like I don't feel like I ever set out to make a pop song or a song that was gonna be some kind of crossover song or whatever... is that for me?

[Zane Lowe]
Yeah, if you want it.

[Eminem]
Thanks man, appreciate it. Urm...

[Zane Lowe]
And then boom, you did! And it didn't stop for years!

[Eminem]
Well boom, it happened but at the same time, like - I never wanted to - when things did did keep happening and when certain things kept hitting the radio and things like that, I mean, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm not stupid. Like, I know when a song has a certain particular sound and sounds like "well maybe this could possibly be a radio record", or when I'm going "fuck, shit, ass!" you know what I'm saying, and I know "this will never go to radio". But at the same time, if a song starts heading that way, cause a lot of times I may even think, I may even think certain things when I'm writing it, like, maybe what person this might connect with, you know what I'm saying like, and who I might connect with with this song. But I never, in making any song I have made, I never wanted to compromise lyrical integrity, yeah, you know, and I always wanted to make sure that if I was rapping on a beat that had some kind of appeal to it and was catchy, that I was at least doing my job as an MC, and you know what I'm saying...

[Zane Lowe]
Oh that's the struggle!

[Eminem]
And doing what I feel like I need to do.

[Zane Lowe]
That's tough man, because you want to give as much quality as you possibly can through your music, you're not going to hold yourself back in case you get successful, but at the same time like you say it's never been on the agenda, and I guess in a way that was part of what caused the problem in the first place that just manifested over that time, huh, like, how do I do both? How do I be good and not court this, not be this guy that everybody expects something from?

[Eminem]
Yeah, urm, I know that early on I went through a lot of that with the "Hi, my name is" record, and it was, urm, like I never understood, like I understood that the record was funny, and i understood that it was a little, urm, how you say, kitschy, or whatever, and maybe the hook was, the whole record was tongue-in-cheek. You know what I'm saying, like I'm still doing a lot of records like that to this day, with the tongue-in-cheek, but that record in particular was just like, it was my, it was almost like my anti-pop song cause it was like my hello to the world but it was my "fuck you" to the world at the same time. So I never understood, like, when all that started happening, like holy shit how did that become a, you know, I guess pop song.

[Zane Lowe]
So when did the penny drop and you realized the more you say "fuck you", the more people are gonna say, you know, "hi, we love you"?

[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean...

[Zane Lowe]
Probably around the Marshall Mathers LP right, cause that's when it really started to, to blow up again?

[Eminem]
Yeah, I think, I think there was a lot of that, and I think that just, coming from being an underground MC and being an underdog and things like that kinda gave me that attitude I think, you know, I think that had a lot to do with it, and then, you know, watching NWA and other people, 2Pac, you know what I'm saying, like, it was like, he's not going to, him or they, aren't going to kiss your ass to make you like their music.

[Zane Lowe over snippet from "Survival"]
Yeah, that's exactly what they want to do, let things slide a bit, you know. Now, you kind of talk about that on this song here, on The Monster (plays snippet from "The Monster"), and I think this is the one where you really address it in the most eloquent way about like, it's the gift and the curse, you know, I'm aware of the trouble it can get you in, I've been through that, you know. Number 1 album, number 1 movie, number 1 this number 1 that, not really in a position to really, kind of, really, be able to absorb that, yet, it's intoxicating, isn't it?

[Eminem]
Yeah, it was like, it was this thing, where, and I'm not gonna lie, I still wish it today, that it was like this thing where I want this attention for this music, but then I wanna be able to go in public, and I wanna be able to eat a fucking sandwich, you know what I mean, and be left alone. So, it was like "man, if I could...", because, I'd never been an attention seeker, and it seems like a hell of a career choice, you know, but, I don't like attention, that's not just why I do it, just to get attention, I don't like to be in public and walk around and be, like, here I am, you know what I mean, like, it's not what I want, I just wanted, my dream was, my dream was for like, fuck man, to be able to one day, like hear rappers that I look up to on the radio, like "yo, what if Jay Z, whoever, what if they heard of me, what if they thought I was dope? You know what I'm saying like? That was where my mentality always was, was with it. So when it all went crazy it was really hard to wrap my head around, you know, a lot of it still is, but especially back then.

[Zane Lowe]
Yeah. You know, you have done something which very few people have done now, you've actually been at the center of the world, the center of that storm, and you've emerged out of it, you popped out of the other side of it, I mean. Elvis didn't do that, you know, Michael Jackson didn't do that, Whitney Houston... a lot of people who have been in the public eye to that extent, unfortunately the list of various reasons, I'm sure personal to them, is too long, who didn't make it through. You have, and what does the world look like to you, when you've come out the other side of that, and you're 5 years sober and you're looking on that chaos for some perspective?

[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean I'm definitely thankful, you know what I mean, I know that could have certainly took another path...

[Zane Lowe]
And gone that way, yeah.

[Eminem]
Yeah, I could have went another direction but, I don't know, I mean, I think that, I feel like, like I'm probably able to see it, I'm able to be more focused now than I've ever been, urm, but I'm also able to I guess put it in perspective. The problem is I can't put a lot of perspective because I don't, there's a lot that's, you know, gone, there's a lot that I don't remember, and maybe that's cool, too, you know what I'm saying, where...

[Zane Lowe]
Probably a good thing?

[Eminem]
Yeah but, I don't know man, I know, I know that, there's so many addicts in this world, you know, and people who have problems like that, that don't make it, you know what I'm saying so I, I'm thankful for that, but urr, you know, I think that's one thing that really helps me, urr, through, and just, keeps me pushing forward is the music, is the passion for that and, and, and, you know.



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Here I go, lyrical
I have no Idea what I'm doin' but I'm spiritual
On the microphone I tear you up in stereo
I'm like the grand wizard, yes, I'm the imperial
I have no fuckin' clue what the fuck I'm doin'
But "Freifick, Muschi", your whole life is ruined
If you try to step to me your life's a jeopardy
'Cause I will seek you out wit'

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yes, here we go – break it down
I got the crown, I'm 'bout to take it now
Yo, I got my man and he's on the guitar
And when it comes to lyrics I go so far
Like a car that I'm drivin', survivin' of Vivarin
I'm alive, I'm like eye of the tiger
And I kick it so, so, fuckin' hard
Now "Freifick, Muschi", don't diss me – regard it, come on!
